      "Manchester United could reap the rewards of Mason Greenwood's stellar performances at Marseille. The 24-year-old made a permanent move from Old Trafford to France in the summer of 2024, with United cleverly including a sell-on clause in his £26.7million transfer.",
      "Greenwood has proven to be a steal for Marseille, netting an impressive 22 goals in the 2024/25 season. He's already chalked up 13 goal contributions this term, including a Champions League strike. Despite struggling in Europe, Marseille are making waves in Ligue 1 under Roberto De Zerbi, currently topping the table.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain could leapfrog them by the end of Sunday however, with Marseille already winning 3-0 against Brest this weekend prior to the champions travelling to Lyon. Greenwood's pivotal role hasn't gone unnoticed by CIES, the football observatory website that provides data and analysis on players' values.",
      "They regularly update their estimated valuations, and Greenwood's stock has certainly risen. In August, he was valued at a maximum of €57m (£49.3m), with the lowest estimate being €49m (£42.3m).",
      "Just a few months on, his top price is now pegged at €64m (£56.2m), with a minimum value of €57m (£48.3m). Should Marseille eventually cash in on the player for somewhere near that figure, United stand to receive approximately £25million thanks to a shrewd 40 to 50 per cent sell-on clause negotiated by Old Trafford officials.",
      "It's proving to be an astute piece of business by United given Greenwood's impressive displays. Since his departure from United, several other talented forwards have been moved on with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli on loan and Alejandro Garnacho sealing a permanent switch to Chelsea.",
      "Marcus Rashford has also made a dream move to Barcelona with Greenwood's fellow academy graduate also impressing in front of goal. Whilst the English winger had netted just once in Marseille's previous five fixtures across all competitions – before converting a spot-kick in Saturday's comfortable 3-0 victory– he bagged four goals in a stunning 6-2 thrashing of Le Havre in mid-October, prompting high praise from De Zerbi.",
      "\"He has what it takes to become one of the best players in the world,\" the manager declared following that performance. \"He's incredibly talented and puts in the work on the training ground.\"",
      "De Zerbi and the Marseille hierarchy clearly rate Greenwood highly, though a departure remains possible, particularly if his exceptional form continues. Links to Italian outfit Lazio surfaced during the summer transfer window, but nothing came to fruition. Interest from European giants like Bayern Munich or Real Madrid pursuing his signature can't be discounted.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has reportedly urged Napoli boss Antonio Conte to snap up Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo during the January transfer window, with the Scotland star championing his former Old Trafford teammate. Mainoo has seen his standing at United plummet under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite being a key player last season, the 20 year old has managed just eight appearances this campaign. Amorim has favoured the combination of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in his Premier League midfield, leaving Mainoo to settle for substitute appearances in seven of the opening 10 matches.",
      "With United already knocked out of the Carabao Cup and absent from European competition, Mainoo's playing time looks set to remain severely restricted until January - potentially jeopardising his World Cup ambitions.",
      "A loan switch has been mooted ahead of the transfer window reopening, with Serie A champions Napoli emerging as frontrunners.",
      "Reports previously suggested the Italian giants were prepared to cover his entire wages to secure his services at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.",
      "According to The Sun, McTominay is now pulling out all the stops to engineer a reunion with Mainoo in Italy. The 28-year-old departed United in 2024 and enjoyed a stellar debut campaign, netting 12 goals whilst helping secure the Scudetto.",
      "McTominay is said to have approached Conte directly to push for Mainoo's signature. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source revealed.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "Amorim recently confessed there simply wasn't space for Mainoo in his team. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",
      "\"We are giving a lot of information, we are working on our fitness because we need to keep momentum during the week with good training, really intense.",
      "\"When you have more games you are just concerned about recovery. We suffered a lot from last season. People forget we played two and three days all of the time and that was really hard for us. But then you have the other side.",
      "\"I see Kobbie Mainoo training today, and he deserves to play, but then I have to take one guy [out] that's playing really well. We should have played in the Carabao Cup, because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing, I need to see Josh, all of these guys deserve to play, but in the end, it is one more game you need to make choices. So you have both sides.\"",

      "Italian giants Napoli have been linked and after making a similar move in 2023, former United teammate Scott McTominay is attempting to manufacture a swoop, according to The Sun.",

      "“And it shows you how football can be a really cruel game at times because Kobbie Mainoo was playing, he reached the England national team, he was going up, up, and up. All of a sudden he is not being picked.",
      "\"Now the question is, does he stay positive, patient, and wait for his moment again? Or he needs to move to a different place to play regularly to get his confidence back and come back to United and start playing more regularly?",

I like that. But at the moment, the manager doesn't see something he can use from the first minute of the game.\"",
      "Mainoo, 20, has made 80 appearances for United since breaking into the side in 2022, scoring seven goals. He has made a further eight outings this campaign, albeit only one of those has been from the start. Mainoo has less than two years left to run on his contract with United.",

      "Theo Walcott has jumped to Thomas Frank's defence after Tottenham Hotspur supporters voiced their frustration during the dramatic 2-2 draw with Manchester United. The Danish boss was subject to jeers from Spurs fans when he hauled off Xavi Simons in the closing stages of the match.",
      "The 22-year-old midfielder, who joined the north London outfit from RB Leipzig for £52m in the summer transfer window, made way for Mathys Tel. Moments after entering the fray, Simons' replacement found the back of the net, firing home an equaliser from close range.",
      "A few minutes later, Wilson Odobert, who had been introduced at the interval, set up what many believed to be the winner. Richarlison diverted the 20-year-old winger's curling effort past the Senne Lammens with a deft header.",
      "Frank made numerous changes throughout the game, with some decisions proving more welcomed than others. However, the Dane ultimately breathed new life into his team, and they came within moments of securing all three points.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day on Saturday evening, Walcott called on Tottenham supporters to 'trust the process'. The former Arsenal forward said: \"I don't think the Tottenham fans felt he got the substitutions right when he made them, to be honest.",
      "\"Odobert was absolutely outstanding when he came on. A player who has to be able to take risks and play with that freedom and the energy, and that's what you have to be able to do as a substitute; you need to be able to commit bodies.",
      "\"What I like about him, he likes to put the ball in when you have space, he likes to change his game – and this is what I talk about when I talk about not being predictable – when you give players, who are ball-carriers, in this amount of space, Manchester United start dropping.\"",
      "Frank rang the changes throughout the encounter. He switched Pedro Porro for Destiny Udogie, introduced Rodrigo Bentancur in place of Joao Palhinha, and replaced Kevin Danso with Cristian Romero.",
      "Walcott continued: \"Udogie was fantastic as well, all three substitutions who came on all contributed. It just shows, trust the manager's process.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"I think that's one thing, as fans, when you watch games, you always feel frustrated in the moment, but they are there for a reason. Thomas Frank is a good manager, he knows exactly what he's doing and he's made the right decision.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following the match, Frank reflected on the substitutions he had made. The Spurs boss said: \"Yeah, sometimes you are lucky.",
      "\"But, of course, every single time I take a decision to sub a player it's with one aim - to make the team win or get back into the game or try to see the game out.",
      "\"It's with only one aim - to try to win the game. No doubt, Mathys did well, great goal, great involvement and in general I think Xavi played a fine game, positive, but also you need a bit of freshness.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney is due a £800,000 tax rebate from HMRC. This windfall comes after the ex-Manchester United star liquidated his image rights company.",
      "England icon Rooney has enjoyed a tumultuous time since his retirement in 2021. He began his managerial journey with Derby County and after a spell with DC United in America, he returned to helm Birmingham City in 2023.",
      "The 40-year-old was sacked after winning twice in 15 matches and his next job would come with Plymouth Argyle. There, he would endure a similarly demanding spell and was relieved of his duties in January 2025 after earning just two points from 13 league games.",
      "Since leaving Plymouth, Rooney has turned his hand to punditry. He penned a deal with the BBC to become a regular Match of the Day studio pundit this summer and is now set for another boost to his wallet.",
      "Rooney is due to receive a substantial tax rebate after liquidating his image rights company. Three years ago, he pocketed around £21million after closing the company, of which he owned 100 per cent of the share capital.",
      "He set up image rights and investment firm Stoneygate 48 Ltd in 2006, but opted to liquidate it as it was \"no longer required.\" Rooney chose to do this after he had retired from playing.",
      "A declaration signed by Rooney at the time reported that he was to receive an expected £20.8m payout from the closure. The last accounts were for the year ended March 31, 2020.",
      "The company's assets consisted of £1m in property, £8.9m in investments and £11.9m in monies owed to the firm, totalling £21.8m. They were offset by ­liquidation costs estimated at £30k, £200k due to HMRC and £750k in other undisclosed bills.",
      "A spokesman on behalf of Stoneygate 48 Ltd said at the time: \"The directors have decided to put the company into solvent ­liquidation as it is no longer required. All debts will be paid in full and money will be returned to shareholders.\"",
      "But before this process is completed, Rooney is now set for another £800k increase thanks to a tax rebate from HMRC. This only adds to his already astronomical net worth.",
      "Rooney's current fortune stands at an estimated £170m. This would make him the world's wealthiest manager and has been bolstered over the years by his various business ventures. During his playing days, it was estimated that Rooney earned upwards of £300k per week. In addition to a lucrative salary, he also penned brand deals with the likes of Nike, Coca-Cola and EA Sports.",
      "His most recent boost came via his BBC contract. It is thought this two-year deal is worth a total of £800k. Although it may complicate any return to management, speaking last month Rooney was honest and admitted that as of now he is comfortable in punditry.",
      "\"No, not really,\" Rooney told talkSPORT when asked if he was in search of another coaching role. \"I'm happy with what I'm doing. I'm still learning in the punditry world and trying to get better at that.",
      "\"I get to see my kids play more instead of the pressures of management. If the right one comes up, after what's happened in my previous jobs, I doubt it. I'm not stupid. I can be honest about that. I'm happy doing what I'm doing.\"",

      "Danny Welbeck left Manchester United after nearly a decade to join rivals Arsenal and is now a prolific goal scorer for Brighton. The English striker never could've predicted the twists and turns his career has taken since his senior professional debut in 2008.",
      "Welbeck was handed his first start by Sir Alex Ferguson against Middlesbrough in the League Cup and made the majority of his United appearances under the iconic manager. The Red Devils academy star played 142 games for his boyhood club, scoring 29 goals, but appearances declined when Louis van Gaal arrived in 2014.",
      "Welbeck made 33 appearances for David Moyes during his time as manager, but played just three times for Van Gaal out of position, prompting him to seek a new challenge elsewhere. Arsenal made the move on the final day of the summer transfer window and secured Welbeck's signature for £16million.",
      "This transfer was a bittersweet moment for the striker, who had been at Old Trafford since the age of eight, but it was a decision that felt necessary. Discussing the reason he left United, Welbeck said: \"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game.",
      "\"I can play it to the best of my ability but that’s not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.",
      "\"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "The centre forward made 126 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 32 goals - three of which came against his old club in Manchester. Welbeck won two FA Cups with the north London side, working under Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery before being released in 2019.",
      "Watford signed Welbeck on a free transfer that summer, and he scored three goals in 20 appearances before leaving the club just one year later. However, in 2020, a new club came calling in the form of Brighton, and the rest, as they say, is history.",
      "Welbeck is still starring for the Seagulls to this day, scoring six goals in the Premier League already this season. So far, the 34-year-old has made 173 appearances for Brighton, netting 43 goals and assisting 17 times - far surpassing his tallies at United, Arsenal and Watford.",
      "Many wouldn't be able to predict Welbeck's resurgence at the Premier League side, given their typical transfer model that targets young and unproven stars. The veteran striker will be glad that the Seagulls took a chance on him five years ago, as he continues to shine in both domestic and European competition, 17 years on from his debut.",

      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has revealed that the club aren't planning to make any new signings in January, suggesting their all of their 2026 business will be done next summer. Barca only made three first-team additions this year, including Marcus Rashford.",
      "The La Liga champions signed Rashford, 28, on a season-long loan from Manchester United. During negotiations, Barcelona inserted an option to buy him permanently at the end of this season for €30million (£26m).",
      "So far, the England international has encouraged Barca chiefs that he'll be worth it. Rashford has scored six goals and provided five assists in 15 appearances, most of which have come from the left wing.",
      "But given their precarious financial predicament, the Catalan heavyweights intend to see out the season before making any decisions. That's why Deco currently has no plans for January.",
      "Speaking at an event on Friday, as Barcelona held an open training session at the newly renovated - but still under construction - Camp Nou, Deco said: \"If we are doing well and there are no surprises, I don't think it's necessary.",
      "\"We know exactly where we can improve and the difficulties we face. Last season, we also went through some difficult moments and we were able to overcome them,\" Deco added, with Hansi Flick's side having won just three of their last seven games since the start of October.",
      "\"When we lower the intensity, we suffer. We need to have the best players. There are no excuses, but when you can't make changes because of injuries and they affect our midfield. There are things to improve even when we win.\"",
      "Flick thinks that Rashford can do even more to help Barca get into their stride this season, with the United loanee having scored in their 3-1 win at home to Elche last weekend. \"When you see the chances he has, one or two goals more will be good, also for him,\" Flick explained.",
      "\"But we can be happy with him, of course. I am very happy with him. He can play on this level and I am happy he shows it, for the fans and for the club, and also for the teammates he is a very important player.\"",
      "Rashford will be hoping to add to his goal tally when Barca travel to Celta Vigo on Sunday. The 28-year-old has scored at Celta's stadium, the Estadio de Balaidos, before. Rashford netted a spectacular free-kick to give United a 1-0 victory in their Europa League semi-final first leg in 2017.",

      "Amorim's men opened the scoring after 32 minutes through Bryan Mbeumo and held on until six minutes from time, when Mathys Tel levelled things. Spurs' Richarlison thought he'd won the match but De Ligt had other ideas.",
      "The closing stages of this 2-2 draw were played without Benjamin Sesko. The striker, who arrived this summer from RB Leipzig for £74million, replaced Noussair Mazraoui in the 58th minute but after squandering an opportunity in the 85th, limped off with a leg injury and left United with 10 men for the final moments.",
      "Before the clash against Tottenham, Amorim was asked about Sesko's early tenure as a United player. The Slovenian has scored just twice this season and his head coach admits he has struggled.",
      "His problems are expected to continue after limping out of that draw with a knee injury.",

He's not relaxed,\" said Amorim, before dropping Sesko from the starting XI against Tottenham. \"He has no experience here, and then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing – and you hear about that with Sesko – and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.",
      "\"To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak. He wants to control everything, and he's not going to control everything.",

      "Mbeumo continued his fine run of form in north London, opening the scoring with a deft header just after 30 minutes. However, the club could be without him for a stretch of games in late December.",
      "The Cameroonian is due to report for international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations on December 21 and would miss at least two matches. But according to The Sun, United would like to strike a deal with Cameroon in order to allow Mbeumo to play in games against Bournemouth on December 13 and Aston Villa on December 21.",
      "It is thought the club will appeal to the Cameroon FA, led by former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o, and ask that Mbeumo remain in England until after these matches have concluded.",
      "Sources indicate that Eto'o and Co. are open to negotiation surrounding this issue, which could mean Mbeumo arrives late for Cameroon's opening fixture against Gabon on December 24. Regardless, should Cameroon progress in the competition, Mbeumo could be missing up until the final on January 18.",

      "However, he lasted less than half-an-hour before he was taken off with an injury. Former United and Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov gave his verdict on the Slovenian and suggested that he was not as prepared as he could have been ahead of coming on.",
      "Speaking to Premier League Productions, Berbatov said: “I want to be supportive, I sympathise with his situation. Yes, he needed to do better, maybe take the ball more to his left foot so this way it eliminates the defender, but we cannot take away the tackle from Mickey van de Ven as well, great, great tackle.",
      "“Maybe that lack of confidence, playing minutes, it affects a player. Then when you get injured out of it, it shows maybe you are not ready to step into the game at full speed.”",
      "Meanwhile, former Spurs star Jermain Defoe had a very similar opinion of Sesko’s outing and suggested he was not ready to take to the pitch. He added: “I said before the game, for a centre forward…",
      "\"When you’re rested or dropped, whatever it is, you’re not in the team and you’re disappointed, but make sure you’re ready to come on, because you can change the game, you get a moment or a chance and you can change the game.",
      "“I’m not saying it was an easy chance because it was a great tackle, but at the same time, when you go through it’s conviction. The first touch always makes the goal, if you take the ball away from the defender then you can go and finish.",

      "Ruben Amorim has acknowledged Manchester United might need to bolster their forward line in January, with the decision hinging on how serious Benjamin Sesko's injury proves to be following the clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday",
      "The manager addressed the striker's fitness concerns during his post-match media briefing after the 2-2 draw. \"We have to check,\" he said. \"He had something in his knee, let's see. Pressed on whether the issue was significant, Amorim responded: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko squandered two promising opportunities against Spurs when presented with decent scoring chances, though Amorim dismissed suggestions that a confidence crisis was the root cause. He remarked: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland ], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United face the prospect of losing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, a situation that has led Amorim to suggest the club might enter the January transfer market. Amorim acknowledged that the seriousness of Sesko's knee problem might affect their strategy.",
      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has been likened to Mohamed Salah following his latest goal for Manchester United. The summer signing from Brentford opened the scoring in United's dramatic 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo bagged his fifth goal in as many appearances against Spurs and his sixth in 12 appearances since joining the Red Devils for £71million. The Cameroon international is Ruben Amorim's top goalscorer so far this season and is earning plenty of plaudits from former Premier League players as a result of his fine form.",
      "Peter Crouch and Owen Hargreaves are the latest ex-pros quick to point out that the United star is capable of more than scoring goals. Former Liverpool forward Crouch believes he's been a big signal of intent from United. \"I've been impressed with him for a number of years now,\" he said on TNT Sport.",
      "\"At Brentford, he was a killer, he is a danger, he's sharp with his touches. Today he played right in front of us, and he's so sharp. When he gets a chance, invariably, he finishes, he's cold in front of goal, and he's been such a big addition to what Manchester United are trying to do.\"",
      "Hargreaves, formerly of Manchester United, went a step further and compared his style to Liverpool star Salah. The Egyptian has bagged 188 goals in 298 Premier League outings for the Reds.",
      "Hargreaves reckons the ability Mbeumo has shown to not be daunted by the demands of Old Trafford is impressive. \"I think his biggest attribute is that he gives quality,\" he said.",
      "\"He reminds me a little bit of Mo Salah in and around the box. When he gets it, he has a clear picture of exactly what he wants. He almost shows no emotion, business in and around the box.",
      "\"You can play into his feet, he can dribble. Technically, I don't think he gets enough credit.",
      "\"People talk about his goal-scoring, rightly so, but he's an exceptional football player. People come to Manchester United, huge names, and struggle with pressure. He just sits there super calm, super chill, top scorer this season.\"",
      "Mbeumo was pleased to see his team continue their unbeaten run. United have not lost since defeat to Brentford in September.",
      "\"I think it brings confidence when we don't lose,\" Mbeumo said. \"It's easier on the pitch, outside of the pitch, on the training ground, everybody is enjoying it a lot.\"",

      "Thomas Frank has defended his Tottenham substitutions despite boos from some supporters during Saturday afternoon's game against Manchester United. The North London side battled to a 2-2 draw with the Red Devils on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank’s former Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo gave the Red Devils the lead only for late goals from substitutes Mathys Tel and Richarlison to flip the game on its head. A late header from Matthijs de Ligt ensured a share of the spoils.",
      "Frank, who was only appointed in the summer, was on the receiving end of criticism from those inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The decision to substitute Xavi Simons with goalscorer Tel with 11 minutes remaining was roundly booed by the home fans.",
      "But Frank has continued to defend his decisions and insists that every change he makes is in an effort to secure victory. Speaking in his post-match press conference, he said: \"Sometimes you are lucky but of course, I would say that every single time I take a decision to sub a player, it is with one aim: to make the team win, or back in the game, or try to see the game out of whatever.",
      "\"One aim: try to win the game. No doubt Mathys did well, great goal, great involvement and in general I think we played a fine game, positive, but also you need a little bit of freshness.\"",
      "Asked if he heard the fans booing, he replied: “I just say every time I make a decision it is with one aim. To make the team better.”",
      "One of Frank’s other decisions throughout the game was to take Argentine defender Cristian Romero off. But the Tottenham boss has confirmed that his withdrawal was just precautionary.",
      "Frank added: “Yeah, he was just done physically. He just came back from that injury. He's fine.”",
      "The Tottenham boss was also asked if his exit could potentially have had an impact on De Ligt’s eventual goal but insists it would have made very little difference.",
      "He said: “Yeah, but I think his position, he wouldn't have been near the goal anyway, so it's a cross on the side, and then he would have been in the middle zone, so this was back post, so that wouldn't have affected anything.”",

      "Tottenham's Mathys Tel has confessed that the Spurs squad were disappointed they didn't manage to secure a win against Manchester United. Thomas Frank's side failed to hold onto their lead against United when Matthijs de Ligt scored late on.",
      "United took the lead in the first half, with Bryan Mbeumo finding the back of the net from an exquisite cross by Amad but Spurs managed to level the score at 84 minutes thanks to a deflected shot from Tel. When Richarlison scored during extra time, it seemed like United's unbeaten streak was about to end.",
      "When quizzed about what Thomas Frank told his team during the interval, Tel revealed: \"We were told to just bring new energy, we needed energy to change the game and that's what we did. We showed great mentality, we deserved to win this game.\"",
      "For United, the biggest concern was Benjamin Sesko's departure. The striker was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute but lasted just half an hour after suffering a knee problem.",
      "Asked if the injury was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui heading to the Africa Cup of Nations next month, United will be sweating over the availability of their attackers. And Amorim was asked if the severity of Sesko's injury could impact their January plans.",
      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "United will resume their quest for a Champions League qualification spot after the November international break. The Tottenham result extends United's unbeaten run to five games, following their second consecutive draw.",
      "Once the international break concludes, United will welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday, November 24 before heading to Crystal Palace the subsequent Sunday. The comfortable run of fixtures continues with two games in four days when they face West Ham United and Wolves.",

      "On the luxurious walk down to the mixed zone at the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the assembled Manchester United and Tottenham media cohorts tried to make sense of the final ten minutes of the game.",
      "United looked to be cruising to victory having rode the initial storm chucked at them by Spurs at the start of the second half. If you had told Patrick Dorgu and his teammates that they would go away with just one point - they would have been disappointed.",
      "As it was, United came out thankful that it was not a defeat. Mathys Tel's deflected strike and Richarlison's flicked header seemed to have sealed the victory for Spurs and ended United's unbeaten run.",
      "However, an exceptionally late Matthijs de Ligt header secured a point and kept United unbeaten since their loss to Brentford. As we waited in hope that we would hear from the United camp, two Tottenham workers headed into the United side of the tunnel with handfuls of champagne flutes.",
      "\"Obviously it was good to come back and show team spirit but we are disappointed in not winning the game.\" For United it was a case of deja vu.",
      "At Nottingham Forest a week prior, United went into the break with a one-goal advantage, squandered it and then rescued it late on. Against Spurs, the result was further in the extremes but the pattern was all too familiar.",
      "In his post-match comments to TNT Sport, De Ligt admitted that United were tired in the second half and this was a sentiment Dorgu could agree with. \"Yeah, I think it was a tough game for everyone,\" he explained.",
      "\"Obviously they play very direct so it was hard for the defenders to always track runs. It was a competitive game.\"",
      "Having earned another point, United now head into the latest international break in better spirits than they were just a month ago. While the Sunderland victory was welcomed, it was hard to tell if that was the exception to the rule or not.",
      "In the end, it was the start of a good run which continues into November. Reflecting on the mood in the camp going into that break, Dorgu was keen to stress that spirits remain high for United and their players.",
      "\"We are unbeaten in five games so we are still feeling good,\" Dorgu concluded. \"We are not losing games so, now, we need to just keep bouncing back and get the next one after the internationals.\"",
      "If United are to thoroughly turn the corner, their next game is one that they need to be winning. Everton have won just once on their travels this season and sit comfortably in mid-table.",
      "The Toffees await Dorgu and Co. on Monday, November 24.",

Richarlison thought he had secured the win in stoppage time but Matthijs de Ligt struck in the 96th minute to grab a point for United.",
      "Here are how United's players rated in London:",
      "Senne Lammens",

      "Harry Maguire",
      "Looked pumped from the first whistle, running over to the away section and applauding. He performed well in the centre of the back three and made important interceptions. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman has recalled Matthijs de Ligt to the national side for the upcoming international break. De Ligt deserved that recall, but was at fault for the equaliser. Then redeemed himself with a heroic header. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Stepped into the midfield at times which meant the shape sometimes looked like a back four. Shaw played ok, but was on the pitch for the late collapse. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Pressed aggressively which earned him applause from Amorim. It didn't feel fair to bring him off in the 59th minute when Patrick Dorgu seemed the logical change. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Started the game by playing a few loose passes and couldn't help United see out the victory. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was not at his best in the centre of the pitch. Looked sluggish and wasn't combative enough against Spurs' midfielders. Played the corner into the box for De Ligt's goal. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struggled in moments during the first half. He replaced Diogo Dalot in the starting team, but still looks raw and unconvincing. His final ball around the box must improve. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Unplayable at times. Finished brilliantly to open the scoring and now has four goals in his last four games. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Got in the way of Matheus Cunha which denied his teammate a chance on goal, but played a clever cross into the box for Mbeumo's goal. Later moved to right wing-back. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Was the same as Fernandes - not at his best against Tottenham. Was booked at the start of the second half for kicking the ball away. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "A couple of half chances not taken. 4",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Allowed Pape Sarr to run past him for Tottenham's goal. Weak. 2",

      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Spurs' reminder",
      "There's no forgetting what happened back in May when United faced Tottenham - and Spurs are making sure of it. Walking on the High Road side of the stadium, you pass one of the main receptions. Peak inside and the Europa League trophy is on full display with fans at 9am queuing for photos with it.",
      "It took the home supporters less than three minutes to chant ‘Champions of Europe, we know what we are’. That returned in added time before De Ligt silenced them.",
      "United defensive fluidity",
      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",
      "Fluidity is clearly what Amorim wants to see moving forward.",
      "Set-piece instructions",
      "Set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was often on the edge of the technical area in the first half. Shortly before the break, you could see him barking instructions to United's defenders and he was clearly unhappy with one player's position as he flagged down Amorim to have a word.",
      "But Fernandes doesn't just dish out criticism. He was full of praise for De Ligt after one clearance and he will have been delighted to see the centre-back score from a corner at the death.",
      "Amorim’s Mbeumo instruction",
      "Not that he needs much encouragement but Amorim was keen to ensure that Mbeumo's levels did not drop against Spurs. He was quick to urge him to make forward runs whenever Amad had the ball.",
      "United looked at their most dangerous when they were playing direct down the flanks.",
      "Amorim warning before goal",
      "In the second half, Amorim sent a warning to his defence when they were leading 1-0 to ensure they stepped up. On this occasion it was Patrick Dorgu who had dropped too deep and he quickly moved up the pitch to ensure he was in line with his teammates.",
      "For Richarlison's late goal, Manuel Ugarte did not step up quickly enough to catch him out. When he watches the goal back Amorim will be furious.",

He’s either got to get his shot away early or he’s got to push that ball forward quicker.",
      "\"He's not going to get that amount of time in the Premier League to work it back on his right foot. This one [the 85th-minute chance] is the bigger puzzle for me. I know he's struggling for confidence, but any centre-forward knows you cannot allow the centre-half to come back at you.",

      "With nearly £43m shelled out on the Netherlands international, there was always going to be more expected of him than Mazraoui, but he struggled to live up to the price tag as his career continued the steady decline it had been on for the best part of five years.",
      "After bursting onto the scene with Ajax, De Ligt's career hit the buffers with failed spells at Juventus and Bayern, with the fee United paid for his services reflective of the player he once suggested he could become rather than the one we had watched over the last five years.",
      "Three months into the new season and how the perception of the Dutchman has shifted.",
      "De Ligt has looked a totally different player in 2025/26. In Saturday's draw with Spurs he marshalled the backline brilliantly, only to let himself down late on as Mathys Tel intelligently shifted away from him and fired Spurs level.",
      "It was a lapse in concentration from De Ligt that will always be punished in the Premier League, but he showed tremendous character to bounce back and rescue a point for United at the death.",
      "“Well, the first thing that’s really important is I had a proper pre-season. I feel, for me and my body, pre-season is always really important,\" De Ligt told MUTV recently when asked about his improved performances this term.",
      "\"I think it was one of the first pre-seasons in five or six years when I didn't have a transfer, an injury or a Euros. The last time was probably my last season at Ajax and that was actually one of the best seasons of my career! I feel it is a big thing that is really important.",
      "“I feel that mentally and physically I am in a really good place. I feel quite confident. Obviously, my teammates and the manager help a lot because they give me this confidence. I think I am also used to the Premier League as well now, the pace, which helps also. Overall, these are the most important things that take me to this level at the moment.”",
      "A full pre-season with the club has certainly helped and De Ligt is looking every bit the £43m player United hoped they had signed last summer.",
      "The Dutchman could have easily let his head drop after his late error at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he should be applauded for fighting back to snatch a point.",
      "United need leaders in the dressing room. De Ligt is just that.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "Manchester United appear destined to eventually benefit from Mason Greenwood continuing his impressive run of form at Marseille. The 24-year-old permanently departed Old Trafford for France in the summer of 2024, with United including a sell-on clause in his £26.7million switch.",
      "Greenwood has made the deal seem like a bargain, having scored 22 goals in the 2024/25 campaign. He has already notched 13 goal contributions this season, with one of those arriving in the Champions League.",
      "Marseille sit outside of the qualification places, having lost three of their four European fixtures. Roberto De Zerbi's side are performing well in Ligue 1, though, and currently sit top of the table, though they could be overtaken by Paris Saint-Germain before the day is over.",
      "Greenwood has played a big role in that, and his importance to the French outfit has been recognised by CIES, the football observatory website which presents data and analysis on footballers and their value tool. They regularly release new estimated valuations of certain players, with Greenwood one of those that has seen an increase.",
      "Back in August, he was estimated to be worth a maximum of €57m (£49.3m), with the lowest being €49m (£42.3m). Just a few months later, his highest price has been declared as €64m (£56.2m), with it now a minimum of €57m (£48.3m).",
      "Marseille potentially selling him down the line for around that price would see United pocket roughly £25 million, having inserted what is thought to be a 40 to 50 per cent sell-on clause into his transfer. That was certainly a smart decision by club chiefs at Old Trafford with Greenwood in fine form.",
      "Though the English forward had managed just one goal in Marseille's last five matches in all competitions – prior to dispatching a penalty in Saturday's 3-0 win over Brest – he scored four times in a 6-2 win over Le Havre back in mid-October, with De Zerbi making his feelings clear.",
      "\"He has what it takes to become one of the best players in the world,\" he said after that match. \"He's incredibly talented and puts in the work on the training ground.\"",
      "De Zerbi and those at Marseille certainly think highly of Greenwood, but an exit cannot be ruled out, especially if he continues performing at such a high level.",
      "Transfer links to Serie A side Lazio emerged this past summer, but no move materialised. A European heavyweight such as Bayern Munich or Real Madrid making a move for his services cannot be ruled out.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo urged his Manchester United teammates to \"stay in the game\" in the closing stages of their draw with Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "United led at the half-time break thanks to a smart header from Mbeumo, but for the second time in eight days they saw their one-goal lead wiped out and they trailed 2-1 heading into the closing stages.",
      "Just as they did at Forest last week, United dug themselves out of a hole with Matthijs de Ligt's late header ensuring they left the capital with a point.",
      "Mbeumo's first-half strike means he has now scored four goals in his last four games for United, and the forward reflected on the draw after the game.",
      "\"But before the first goal we conceded, we played a very good game. Very solid, but we still have to work on the goals we concede.",
      "\"I tried to talk to the guys and tell them to stay in the game. It was five minutes to go, we know anything can happen and I think we all have a very strong mentality now to come back and that’s what we have done. It builds confidence when we don’t lose.\"",
      "Mbeumo continued: \"It is always easier inside the pitch, outside the pitch, on the training ground so everyone is enjoying it a lot and we are going to try and build this as long as possible.",
      "\"Obviously it (United) is a lovely place to play, to develop, and I have got great teammates who are helping me and I think everybody is working really hard and it makes the job for everybody easier.\"",
      "The draw with Spurs means United are now five games unbeaten in the Premier League. After the November international break comes a home clash with Everton before a trip to Crystal Palace and a home game against West Ham.",

      "Ruben Amorim chugged from his water bottle when Tottenham went 2-1 up against Manchester United.",
      "United led for most of the match against Spurs but collapsed within minutes and were staring a first defeat for 42 days in the face until Matthijs de Ligt redeemed himself with a heroic header.",
      "Mbeumo's performance was a small triumph for Amorim, as he started on the left for the first time and performed. The 26-year-old is slowly becoming the dressing room's most important player.",
      "Amorim reverted to the striker-less front three again. Although Mason Mount was preferred in that set-up for the opening three games of the season, Amad was picked instead in the capital.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was absent due to a knock picked up in training, so Amorim named Jack Fletcher on the bench to ensure the record of including an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years continued.",
      "Fletcher was named on the bench against Tottenham in February alongside six other youngsters from the academy due to injuries, but Amorim had stronger options available this time around.",
      "Tottenham had won just four points at home this season and they were booed off after losing against Chelsea last weekend, having mustered just a single shot on target in 90 minutes.",
      "This was United's first clash with Tottenham since the Europa League final. Spurs decided to sack Ange Postecoglou after that game and Thomas Frank was hired from Brentford.",
      "Frank was hugely complimentary of Mbeumo in the build-up to the game, predicting that he will enjoy \"fantastic success\" at United. Mbeumo looked sharp as he fired a shot into the top right corner during the warm-up. Tom Heaton had no chance of saving it.",
      "\"Champions of Europe, we know what we are,\" taunted the home fans after kick-off. They jeered moments later when Senne Lammens conceded a corner from a simple back pass from De Ligt.",
      "Lammens has been supremely confident since his arrival from Royal Antwerp but didn't look switched on. The jeers from the Tottenham fans would have focused his mind.",
      "The Europa League final was not a watchable contest and Saturday's fixture was already an improvement just 10 minutes in. Tottenham looked capable when they broke forward and Mbeumo had a golden chance when he was sent through to face Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "Amorim applauded Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu for their speed to press when Tottenham received the ball. Diogo Dalot was slower off the mark last weekend and was moved to the bench.",
      "United did not make a convincing start and Amorim sent players to warm up ahead of the interval. Matheus Cunha tangled with Amad after a breakdown in communication and there was a feeling the decision to drop Benjamin Sesko was not paying off, but Mbeumo is in superb form and popped up to score again.",
      "There is no stopping Mbeumo at the moment. He was named player of the month for October and finished brilliantly to head into the top left corner after an intelligent cross from Amad.",
      "United took the lead in the 34th minute against Nottingham Forest and scored in the 32nd minute against Tottenham. Amorim summoned Bruno Fernandes to receive instructions after Casemiro's goal last weekend and Luke Shaw received instructions while United celebrated this time around.",
      "United had won just one of their past 10 away league games before facing Tottenham, a record they must improve if they want to qualify for Champions League football this season.",
      "Lammens has been crucial and the Belgium international made a tremendous save from point-blank range at the start of the second half to deny Cristian Romero. He then bettered that save just minutes later.",
      "United started awfully in the second half against Forest and Amorim was concerned to see history repeating itself. United must find a way to kill their opponents off with a second goal.",
      "Amorim reacted by introducing Sesko for Mazraoui, which meant Amad moved to right wing-back. The 23-year-old carved out a wonderful chance for Bruno Fernandes, who fired well over the bar.",
      "United could not extend their advantage and paid the price when Tottenham finally found an equaliser through Mathys Tel. Manuel Ugarte allowed Pape Matar Sarr to burst forward and De Ligt was turned by Tel. Ugarte was far too weak, and he's been a disaster signing for £42million.",
      "Mbeumo was the standout performer again. He gestured as if to say \"are you not entertained\" after opening the scoring and celebrated in the exact same manner when he fired United into the lead against Liverpool at Anfield, but he is scoring so often that he needs to vary his routine.",
      "United fans will not care whether Mbeumo celebrates nonchalantly or whether he uses the humorous 'Homer Simpson' dance. The Reds have a new hero and it's only a matter of time before he has his own chant.",
      "The club needs more signings like Mbeumo. They don't need more signings like Ugarte.",

      "Manchester United snatched a point from their Premier League clash against Tottenham even with ten players on the pitch after suffering two injury blows. Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring in the first half, but goals from Mathys Tel and Richarlison looked to have handed Spurs the points only for Matthijs de Ligt to equalise in the game's dying embers.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side headed into the game unbeaten in four matches with consistency built from minimal changes to his starting XI. That changed slightly on Saturday with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire and Patrick Dorgu coming in for Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There was also a change on the bench with a minor issue seeing Kobbie Mainoo miss out. His absence saw United's injury list double with Lisandro Martinez the only absentee as he recovers from a serious knee injury.",
      "In the space of 17 minutes at Spurs, that increased to four potential injury problems with Maguire appearing to injure his hamstring and Sesko trudging off to leave United with a man disadvantage as Amorim had made all his substitutions.",
      "With that being said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest United injury updates and their potential return dates with the November international break on the horizon.",
      "Maguire was captured on camera clutching his hamstring after a dual with Richarlison. He attempted to continue but clearly was in pain which saw him replaced by Yoro after 72 minutes.",
      "Just over half-an-hour on from being introduced by Amorim, Sesko picked up an injury which saw him head straight down the tunnel. He seemed to suffer the problem when stretching to shoot as he swiftly sat down on the turf after that attempt before receiving treatment and subsequently limping off.",
      "Amorim appeared to suggest that Casemiro could also not continue when explaining how injuries helped Tottenham start a comeback.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko has \"struggled a little bit\" since joining the club.",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. The 22-year-old started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month. However, he was benched against Liverpool at Anfield and failed to fire in the next two matches.",
      "The Slovenia international scuffed two chances against Nottingham Forest last weekend. United legend Gary Neville reacted by saying: “He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in.\"",
      "Amroim was asked whether he is relaxed about Sesko's start in Manchester. \"Yeah, I'm relaxed. He's not relaxed,\" he said. \"What I mean is that I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle.",
      "\"That is normal. He has no experience here. And then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing, and you hear about that with Sesko, and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.",
      "\"If you don't perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media, and sometimes they are right.",
      "\"To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak, wants to control everything, and he's not going to control everything.",
      "\"So I know, and I say that when I start training with Ben, he has more potential than I was thinking. He’s going to struggle and we need to understand how he likes to play also to put in our ideas.",
      "\"So everything, I think I'm quite relaxed with that. He is going to be our striker for the long term. But he's going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride, and that is a normal thing in football.\"",
      "Discussing the impact of former United players criticising in the media, Amorim responded: \"Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact.",
      "\"So let's embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players. That is not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks.",
      "\"Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie. So of course, it's hard to hear, but my advice to Ben is you are going to get used. And then it's going to be natural.",
      "\"We are going to help him and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he's going to succeed.\"",
      "Amorim will decide whether Sesko retains his starting role against Tottenham this weekend. United are set to play Spurs for the first time since they were defeated in the Europa League final in Bilbao, after which Ange Postecoglou was sacked by Tottenham.",
      "\"It’s completely different. I said already, I'm really lucky to be here. And I know that is also important that someone to understand how lucky I am to have this opportunity,\" said Amorim about staying at United.",
      "\"If you see the game, I think we deserve to win. In the end, it doesn't matter. It's hard to see a coach that wins a European cup to go away and the other guy stays. But sometimes it's the difference of maybe in the future to win more important titles. So that's, I think, what Manchester United is thinking.",
      "\"Let's give time to the coach and see what's happening. And then we'll see. So I just want to say about that question, that I'm really lucky to have the support that I have in this club.\"",
      "United will head into the November international break with 20 points if they win against Tottenham.",
      "\"Oh, what I think is that we can win any game. If we have this opportunities, let's make everything to win,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Let's try to address every detail to try to win every game. I don't want to talk about the new goal. You said yourself that everything is so close [in the table], everything so close up, and everything's so close down.",
      "\"Three weeks can change everything. It changed everything. We had a completely different conversation four weeks ago. So let's focus on the next game, what we can do.",
      "\"I also agree that when you are one down, playing away, feeling in control of the game, knowing that you can be in second place near the top, we could start that second half in the different way.",
      "\"That I can agree and the players felt that and we talk about that during the week. So let's focus just winning Tottenham. Can we win Tottenham? I think we can. Let's do everything to win the next one.\"",

      "Adam Wharton has openly spoken about the interest from Manchester United heading into the January transfer window.",
      "United have long admired the 21-year-old and were heavily linked with a move for him in the summer. His progress at Crystal Palace has seen him emerge as one of the most promising talents in his position, earning a place in the England squad and attracting interest from several top European clubs.",
      "Previous reports suggest Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Wharton, but the midfielder remains fully focused on his role at Palace. He has four years remaining on his current deal at Selhurst Park, following an £18 million move to south London from Blackburn Rovers in 2024.",
      "In an interview with The Athletic, Wharton spoke openly about the speculation. \"I don't really look into it or think too much about it,\" he said. \"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me.",
      "\"My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, 'Is it true this club's interested?' I’m like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn't know.'\"",
      "When pressed about United's interest, Wharton added: \"I don't know who's spreading it or who at United is looking at it. I see it and I'm like, 'OK', and then I carry on with my day.",
      "\"United, the big teams, they're all linked to 10, 20 different players. If I'm one of 20, then it's nothing special, so it doesn't really mean too much. I speak with my agent about planning ahead and possibilities.",
      "\"But at the end of the day, it is who's interested and who's willing to try and get you and if that becomes the case? You can speak about it, but you've got to represent that on the pitch and prove that you deserve it.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Martin Keown has praised Manchester United for showing signs of improvement in recent weeks and has outlined where they can hurt Tottenham this afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will head to west London to face Spurs, who have had a mixed run of form at home - three losses, one win, and one draw. Away from home, however, they remain unbeaten.",
      "Meanwhile, United have won just once on the road this season - the 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. But after a difficult start to their Premier League campaign, they've built some momentum and are now four games unbeaten.",
      "Keown believes the Reds have the edge, citing two players as the team's driving force.",
      "\"I feel Manchester United are just slightly ahead. Spurs are struggling to win a home game, I think it's only one win in five, but away from home, they've been quite magnificent,\" the former Premier League defender said on",
      ".",
      "\"We have to say it's an improvement. I think finally the players have taken on board what the manager's asked them to do. I think it's from [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, the amount of work they're doing is absolutely ridiculous.",
      "\"They retreat to the edge of their own box, they're able to get three players on the sides and what's happening is, if you're looking at Luke Shaw, he'll come out now, from the back three so go and press and then Amad on the right will form a back four.",
      "\"There's a lot of information for those players. It's taken them a hell of a lot time but now look at the number of chances that they're creating. I mean, they have eight shots on target against Arsenal at the start of the season.",
      "He added: \"I think in the sum total since then, it's maybe eight from all the opponents Arsenal played since, so it gives you an idea this is a Manchester United side that seem to be improving but there's some way to go.\"",
      "Keown also pointed out areas where United could exploit Spurs.",
      "\"I've just sat down the last hour and watched the game last week against Chelsea and honestly, stop, start, no intensity, not pressing from the front,\" he explained. \"Thomas Frank, I've been impressed with him, there was an incident after the game where the players refused to shake his hand.",
      "\"I'm not even sure Thomas Frank should have been on the pitch at that point, because this might have worked at Brentford but when you're playing Chelsea, they're an nemesis team for Spurs, you think about when they denied them winning the league all those years ago.",
      "\"He probably shouldn't have been there, they were hurting and rightly so, but I like Thomas Frank. But there's an intensity or lack of intensity at home which they're suffering from at the moment.\"",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid on Sunday.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have picked up a win now, which was over Leeds and brings an ever harsher spotlight on Daniel Farke.",
      "And suddenly Eddie Howe is looking a bit nervous too.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but it’s looking more and more positive at home and in Europe, and going into the international break on the back of a 4-0 win over a very good Bournemouth side is a lovely place to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been two wins from two since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously third in the league.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 11th in the table after 11 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",

      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",

      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that.

      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",

      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",

      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and what is now officially an iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. League position can mislead given the congestion behind Arsenal and a bloated mid-table, but Newcastle are now closer to the bottom three than they are to 13th-placed Everton, and whatever the mitigation that just won’t do.",

      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",

      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost five in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an eight-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "Liverpool now also trail in forlornly behind Manchester City, Chelsea, Sunderland Tottenham, Aston Villa and – most humiliating of all – Manchester United.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "We’re ruling Liverpool out of the title race after that abject defeat at Man City, who are definitely not out of it after cutting Arsenal’s lead to four.",
      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has hit out at match officials over a “wrong decision” during his side’s 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has argued that Liverpool have no chance of winning the Premier League title after their 3-0 loss against Man City.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Man City, not Liverpool, are Arsenal’s main title challengers as Pep Guardiola bossed Arne Slot and Ibrahima Konate was as bad as Jeremy Doku was good…",
      "Borussia Dortmund, FC St. Pauli and other German fanbases are helping show that a football club’s role extends into the communities surrounding it."

      "A Liverpool fan is ramping up the pressure on Arsenal after they dropped points to Sunderland on Saturday. Would the Gunners be the ‘biggest bottlers’ in Premier League history if they threw away their lead from here?",

      "Send your thoughts on anything and everything to theeditor@football365.com…",
      "",
      "It’s fairly clear Arsenal will win the league this season since every other team is in transition or Chelsea but watching them time waste and then concede an equaliser in the 96th minute is hilarious. Also moaning about injuries when their anti football approach means a third of the game is just waiting for free kicks and corners to be taken.",
      "Also no team in history has been 6 points ahead after ten and failed to win the league (6 previous teams have been in that position and all won it). So if they did fail to is it fair to finally declare this Arsenal side the biggest bottlers in the history of the league? Bottled it 2 seasons ago to City, bottled even being a contender last season. Surely not 3 times in a row…?\nMinty, LFC",
      "",
      "I said to fellow Gooners before the Sunderland v Arsenal game “this ain’t going to be easy!” And lo and behold watching the first half, Arsenal were second to everything. My local pub went mental when they scored…ho hum LOL!  Not many Arsenal lovers in the pub.",
      "I said to a fellow Gooner: ” we’re not in this, I’ll be happy for a draw!” However, in the second half, Arsenal took control and at 2:1 we deserved to be in front…oh dear, no set pieces! So in the end I was disappointed with the draw.",
      "I’ll say that Sunderland showed the correct approach and scored twice against Arsenal and made Raya produce outstanding saves. The game was open and exciting!",
      "Arsenal scored two exquisite goals because that’s the only way they could score. Arsenal barely had a corner but they showed what they can do from open play.",
      "I’m pissed off with the result when we had a few minutes left to keep them at bay. Were the substitutions necessary when we in control of the midfield? Still, I think any manager would do the same.",
      "Anyway, this is no blip. Arsenal still didn’t lose. A point away from home is valuable and Arsenal would normally lose these games  Still only one defeat.\nChris, Croydon",
      "",
      "As an Arsenal fan I can’t deny I’m disappointed at conceding a last minute equaliser and I’m still a bit miffed at Gabriel for playing for a foul rather than just defending. What is it about the North East that causes him to fanny about so much?",
      "Nevertheless, that was a proper game of football and thank goodness we have a promoted team that is shaking things up once more. Sunderland were very good value for their point and they will give any team in the league a game, especially at home. They have that combination of skill and robustness that will disrupt many a defence and attack, so good on them for adapting to the division above so well.",

      "What does it say about the League and the so called top 6 when our toughest game after Anfield, Old Trafford, St James and playing City at home that our hardest game this season was at Sunderland.",

      "This doesn’t mean Liverpool will burn him alive if he chooses to come back years later. The season is not even halfway through for Liverpool fans to have had enough time to get over it. Aren’t you hurt when your loved one moves away? If the hatred stays for years, then yea, call out the Liverpool fans.",
      "It takes a special kind of maturity to not be pissed at one of your own leaving you and giving them a good send off. Or a smaller club. Football is not the place to show this maturity.",
      "Liverpool might just have shown they are a smaller club playing the way they did against Madrid. lower possession in years? pff, everyone knows Liverpool can’t play possession.

But if the whole project comes crashing down without them, serious questions will be asked of Amorim and his squad. Realistically, a club with such large transfer expenditure over the last three years has no excuse not to cope.",

      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Manchester United therefore deserved to win.",
      "There was a predictable spattering of boos at half-time from the Tottenham fans, who had watched another insipid attacking performance from their team on a home patch which has reaped the scant reward of 13 points from their previous 19 Premier League games.",
      "While Joao Palhinha and Pape Matar Sarr offered the very same inability to progress the ball from the base of midfield, Xavi Simons was frequently spotted looking up and seeing no-one to either bounce the ball off or find running in behind thanks to the almost comically inert and toothless trio of Brennan Johnson, Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani playing ahead of him.",
      "The surprise in Spurs’ one decent chance wasn’t Richarlison entirely missing his header but Johnson creating that opportunity with a very fine cross, such was their shocking end product or even ability to get into a position where end products matter besides.",
      "Micky van de Ven produced a sublime tackle to deny Benjamin Sesko late in the game which ended up being worthy of the Man of the Match award as Ally McCoist scratched his head in search of alternatives, but the centre-back didn’t cover himself in glory in the first half.",
      "Understandably buoyed by his extraordinary solo goal against Copenhagen, he ignored the first inevitable and thoroughly enjoyable roar from the Tottenham fans when he jinked past a Manchester United forward with the ball at his feet from the back, but failed at the second time of asking, imagining the goal celebration when a full 70 yards from goal before being tackled after about ten of those yards as the ball got away from him.",
      "And while Sarr is undeniably the chief culprit when laying blame for the Manchester United opener, a less panicked centre-back would have taken a touch and cleared, while one with Van de Ven’s very particular set of skills could have dribbled his way out of trouble, with Bruno Fernandes admittedly close but also the only Manchester United player in his vicinity.",
      "There are also few more gear-grinding sights than the public dressing down of one player by another in a blatant bid to make sure everyone in the stadium knows who’s at fault. Sarr knows he’s made a mistake, the fans know he’s made a mistake. The only purpose the on-pitch scolding serves is to make Van de Ven look like a self-serving so-and-so.",
      "The quality of Spurs’ forwards was in stark contrast to Manchester United’s for the vast majority of this game. Amad Diallo’s delivery for Mbeumo was excellent, and while the Cameroon international scoring a header with his feet firmly rooted on the ground isn’t a great sign of Spurs’ defensive order, it was very well directed by a player who was a constant threat both with and without the ball.",

      "United looked to be cruising, albeit not entirely convincingly, towards a relatively comfortable victory until the managers rang the changes in the second half.",
      "The most ardent boos of the day came when Xavi Simons was taken off once again. But Frank may well be afforded more leeway with regard to his hooking in future as his replacement Mathys Tel scored the equaliser with a deflected shot past Senne Lammens after a quite brilliant first touch following a cross from fellow sub Destiny Udogie, who – like yet another sub, Wilson Odobert – did this alien thing of taking on and beating defenders before delivering the ball.",
      "Frank also deserves credit for leaving Richarlison on the pitch. Few would have complained at him not coming out for the second half, let alone still being around to expertly flick Odobert’s shot past Lammens with his head.",
      "But as much blame should be laid at Amorim’s door as praise bestowed upon Frank after the Manchester United boss contrived to put his team in a position where the towering Matthijs de Ligt header deep into stoppage time was required for them to claim a point when they looked destined for three for so long.",
      "Mason Mount’s touch and blind pass for Sesko before that Van de Ven tackle was stunning, and their introduction from the bench made a positive difference, but why oh why is Amorim obsessed with changing his centre-backs? Harry Maguire had been faultless and while Leny Yoro didn’t do anything wrong per se, it just creates a needless disruption when things are going smoothly.",
      "And frankly we can’t imagine just how entirely knackered, injured or concussed Casemiro would have to be to make it a good idea to bring him off for Manuel Ugarte. Tottenham had no joy in front of the United defence before that change was made in the 72nd minute, and Odobert was found in that space for both goals.",
      "Amorim got his starting XI right, Frank got it wrong, but the Tottenham manager outclassed his Manchester United counterpart from the touchline. They each did their level best to lose this game through their decisions, but instead head into the international break with a point that is serviceable if uninspiring, which also neatly serves as a perfect description of both of these teams right now.",

      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Tottenham’s last 19 Premier League games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium comprise three wins, four draws and 12 defeats. It’s a harrowing run which would ordinarily make firm Manchester United favourites amid their promising uptick in form.",
      "But the Red Devil somehow contriving to lose not once, not twice or even thrice to Spurs last season but four times, combined with Amorim’s side winning just once away from home this term, makes this a particularly hard game to call, with their respective impossible-to-gauge quality making it near impossible.",
      "Much of the criticism aimed at Amorim in his time at Manchester United, before the improvement of late which saw him named Manager of the Month for October, has been based around his obstinacy.",
      "It’s 3-4-3 or bust and it’s typically been the latter. He’s stubbornly refused to deviate from his formation and philosophy, and while we don’t expect that to change too much against Tottenham, it could feel a tad perverse to some that – as he admitted in a pre-match interview – he’s made changes to his team with the aim of “doing something different” on the back of three wins and a draw in his last four games.",
      "“We’ve been working on it this week,” he added, and that’s a luxury he has over Thomas Frank and most of the other managers of teams vying for places towards the top of the Premier League, with no European football this season granting him the space to make tactical tweaks and work on new things midweek to make the push for qualification this season.",
      "Amorim made three changes to his starting line-up, with Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu all returning in place of Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Benjamin Sesko, who drop to the bench.",

      "Perhaps the changes have been made in a bid to replicate their performance against Liverpool, where the lack of a focal point caused no end of problems for Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, or maybe Tottenham’s insipid display vs Chelsea prompted him to pack his team full of pressers to push a panicking Spurs into ceding possession as regularly as they did against the Blues.",
      "But after Amorim naming an unchanged side against Nottingham Forest for the first time in the Premier League was a landmark call to show why Manchester United should be in the running for a return to the Champions League, so too is this newfound will to do “something different”.",
      "It points to a level of comfort, from Amorim in his players and from his players in him. Having taken a very long time to come to terms with the basics of his philosophy, they’ve now reached a stage where Amorim believes he can make adjustments to the blueprint for individual games.",

      "Thankfully, the true 9s are fighting back – even Pep thought it necessary to buy the best there is – and the outlook for the more traditional centre-forwards is looking a lot brighter than it did not long ago.",

      "It’s no wonder we’re seeing too many handsome centre-backs at the top level. At least half of them have got f*** all to do other than pad their passing stats. Twenty-thousand-plus for Virgil van Dijk, you say? Stop posing and put your head on that long throw, you big, beautiful b*stard.",

And as part of the drive to turn shot-stoppers into playmakers, goalkeepers have lost something that once made them identifiable by their style: the big punt.",

      "“In my case, I think I try to give my opinion, but a constructive one, and try maybe to see more of the positive side of things, expressing what I expect from the players.

      "We start with the table boiling most p*ss so far this season. The one that highlights how reliant Arsenal are on set-pieces for their goals.",
      "We know that to be true because only three teams have scored fewer goals in open play. The Gunners are 15th in this table because the alphabet. They could just as feasibly be 17th, with only Forest, Leeds and Wolves below them.",

      "",
      "Is that a problem? Jamie O’Hara thinks so, but no one is coming to take away Arsenal’s set-pieces.",
      "The opposite seems to be true, according to this table. If everyone stopped giving Arsenal the corners they are so reliant on, they might not be away over the horizon a quarter of the way into the season.",
      "Of course, Arsenal’s title charge is powered by more than just dead balls. This and this are just as important in their early-season success. David Raya has faced one shot on target in the last four games, FFS. At this point, Mikel Arteta could probably win the title playing rush goalie.",

      "",
      "Manchester United are similarly absurd.",
      "At the extreme ends, they have been tipped for both a relegation battle and a title charge, when the truth almost certainly lies somewhere in the middle. They are not as bad as their start suggested, but nor should anyone be getting carried away with a four-game unbeaten run, relief though it certainly is for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Like Spurs, United are both gaining and dropping points when they really ought not to.",

      "United are back, are they? Well, not quite. Because they still balls it up against bottom-half opposition.",
      "They beat Burnley – just – but dropped points at Forest and Fulham while taking nothing from Brentford. Only Forest and Wolves have taken fewer points against sides 11th to bottom.",
      "United’s problem is probably similar to Spurs’: they are happiest when they opposition is coming on to them. When they are expected to seize the initiative, that’s when they run into trouble. So Saturday’s meeting at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium should be revealing.",

      "Sunderland are one of the stories of the season so far. They hardly tore up the Championship but here they are, bloodying the big boys’ noses while mixing it in the top four. You would have to be a Geordie – or a Coventry fan, weirdly – not to enjoy what the Black Cats are doing.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results. There are only five teams left unbeaten in the Champions League, and three of those are Arsenal, Man City and Spurs.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 12th, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",
      "Total points: 89.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 62.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",

But the big three should all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night warriors.",

      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently around the cut line at 24th and 26th.",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",

      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",

Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",

      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",

      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
