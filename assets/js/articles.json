      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were among the players allowed to leave Manchester United in the summer(Image: Nigel French/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United ushered in a fresh era with Michael Carrick's first match in the dugout. The impressive win and outstanding display in last weekend's Manchester derby seemed a far cry from the gloomy atmosphere that characterised Ruben Amorim's spell in charge.",
      "There had been some hope under the Portuguese head coach during the summer transfer window following United signing a new goalkeeper and attacking options. Amorim was also forthright about those he wanted to offload, with five players being excluded from his plans for the season.",
      "This led to permanent transfers for Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to Chelsea and Real Betis, respectively. Marcus Rashford secured a loan switch to Barcelona and Jadon Sancho temporarily moved to Aston Villa, while Tyrell Malacia stayed at Old Trafford. Here's how the five players have responded since expressing a desire to leave United in the summer.",
      "Carrick's appointment as interim manager signals a new beginning and potentially provides an opportunity for Rashford to rejoin his boyhood club. The striker rapidly lost favour under Amorim, moving to Villa last year before completing a summer loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "In October, when asked if he wished to remain with Barcelona, Rashford told ESPN: \"Oh yeah, for sure. I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it is an honour.\"",
      "Rashford has netted eight goals and provided 11 assists in 29 appearances for Barcelona, who can sign him permanently for £26million. Despite the 28-year-old confirming his wish to stay, new United boss Carrick offers hope that the situation may still change.",
      "Rashford is familiar with the United manager, having shared the pitch with him on 48 occasions during his playing career. Until a permanent transfer to Barcelona is completed, there remains a possibility - albeit a remote one - that Rashford might opt to play under his former team-mate at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford has relished his loan spell at Barcelona(Image: Michael Regan - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "The young winger's time at United seemed all but over following remarks he made after being left on the bench for last season's Europa League final. Garnacho did demonstrate moments of brilliance in a United jersey before Chelsea pounced to secure a £40m deal.",
      "Like his former club, the 21-year-old has encountered a managerial change this season amid an inconsistent start at his new club. In 23 outings, Garnacho has found the net six times and contributed three assists across all competitions.",
      "Antony is among the latest in a growing list of players who have improved after leaving Old Trafford. Having struggled to justify his substantial transfer fee at United, the Brazilian started to rediscover his best form during his loan stint at Real Betis last season.",
      "The Spanish side waited until September to finalise a deal that could reach £21.6m but he's already proving to be excellent value for Betis. Antony has registered 15 goal contributions in 23 appearances for his new side, who are once more pursuing European football.",
      "Jadon Sancho has not been a regular starter for Aston Villa(Image: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)",
      "There was considerable fanfare when Jadon Sancho arrived from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but the winger is currently on his third loan spell away from United. Chelsea paid United £5m to avoid making his transfer permanent in the summer, prompting the 25-year-old to join Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho has yet to make a significant impression for Unai Emery's team, failing to score or provide an assist in his first 18 matches, though Villa's injury crisis could soon result in an extended run in the side. The attacker is currently in the final months of his United deal, but there is an option for a one-year extension.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is another player approaching the end of his United contract. The defender was told he could look for opportunities elsewhere, having spent part of the previous season on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "However, the full-back stayed at United and was ultimately brought back into the first-team setup after working hard to return to fitness. The 26-year-old has regularly found himself as an unused substitute since being recalled to the squad, apart from a brief outing against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "While Carrick offers Malacia an opportunity to make an impression on a new coach, the Dutchman faces significant competition at left-back and has reportedly held talks over his future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne and Coleen Rooney were joined in the Old Trafford directors' box by Manchester United boss Michael Carrick as their son Kai, 16, made his debut at the Theatre of Dreams. Rooney Jr was in action for the Red Devils' Under-18s in their clash against Derby in the FA Youth Cup.",
      "He came on as a substitute in extra-time and looked lively during his short spell on the pitch, despite playing two years above his age group. United beat Derby 2-1 after the extra period to seal their progression through to the fifth round.",
      "Carrick has made a point of throwing himself into all levels of the club since being named United manager until the end of the season following the departure of Ruben Amorim.",
      "He was in attendance at Leigh Sports Village on Tuesday night to watch United's U21s beat Sporting Lisbon, a journey his predecessor failed to make once in his 14-month tenure.",
      "Carrick was flanked by assistants Steve Holland, Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate, and the quartet were all in attendance once again at Old Trafford on Friday night.",
      "The U18s victory, courtesy of an own goal by Luca Crolla and a smart finish by Chido Obi, made it a hat-trick of victories inside a week for United's first team, U21s and their kids.",
      "Kai Rooney takes a selfie with a fan after his Old Trafford debut(Image: Getty Images)",
      "On his decision to attend, Carrick said: \"My message of support is that I'm coming along to watch and I'm excited. I was lucky enough to play in and win the FA Youth Cup when I was young at West Ham.",
      "\"It's such an important competition, especially for this club. Young players, Old Trafford under the floodlights, feeling what it means, a bit of expectation.",
      "\"It's a fantastic opportunity for the young boys to go and take the next step. We're all fully behind them, it'll be a tough game, but we're looking forward to it.\"",
      "Kai's first Old Trafford appearance comes fives years after he signed his first contract with the club his father played for with such distinction, becoming United's all-time record goal scorer.",

      "Rooney Sr had already burst on to the scene as a 16-year-old, scoring a memorable goal for Everton against Arsenal as he set the world alight at his boyhood club.",
      "He left Goodison Park for United aged 18 and would go on to play 559 games for the club, scoring 253 goals. He won five Premier League titles, one FA Cup, three League Cups, the Europa League and the Champions League during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Luke Shaw once shed light on what the rest of the Manchester United squad thought of Casemiro by sharing a private joke from the dressing room. United announced this week that Casemiro will leave the club at the end of the season as a free agent.",
      "The 33-year-old Brazilian’s whopping £350,000-per-week contract expires this summer, with United opting not to renew his deal. The five-time Champions League winner joined United for £60million in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge and proved an instant hit, scoring seven goals and providing seven assists that season despite being a defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro’s Old Trafford career has seen him play 146 games and score 21 goals to date, though the veteran’s biggest contributions were on the defensive end. Comments made by United team-mate Shaw reflected that defensive importance during his first season, when the English left-back highlighted how highly the rest of the Red Devils dressing room rated his tackling, while also mentioning perhaps his biggest flaw.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Shaw revealed in a press conference in 2023: \"I think it's obvious to see how important he is to the team. For us as defenders, it gives us a feeling of security. He loves to win the ball back and tackle.",
      "\"We joke he likes to give the ball away so he can win it back. I'm very happy to have him back tomorrow night because he's been a big miss for us.\"",
      "Before that, Casemiro’s Brazil team-mate Raphinha also heaped praise on the former Real Madrid star. \"Man, Casemiro is a player that I always talk about to my friends, my relatives. Casemiro is a player that I’d particularly like to have on my team,\" Barcelona's Raphinha told ESPN Brasil.",
      "\"Because in addition to the experience he has in football, in the things he has achieved in football, he’s a great leader, he’s a great person and he manages to complete a team with the football, with the quality he has, and with the defensive part that for me, he’s one of the best defensive midfielders in the world.\"",
      "Casemiro's tackling is his best trait(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Such comments highlight the defensive qualities United and Michael Carrick’s managerial successor will miss next season, as well as his experienced voice in the dressing room. Several young midfielders have already been linked with a United transfer as the club look to rebuild their engine room.",
      "Casemiro said this week: \"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life. From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",

      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund could potentially be joined by another Manchester United colleague at Napoli. The Italian heavyweights are reportedly keen on securing Jadon Sancho.",
      "The winger has endured difficulties since his big-money switch to Old Trafford and he has spent periods on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and currently Aston Villa. Sancho experienced a rift with Erik ten Hag and, following Chelsea's decision to pay a fee to avoid making his transfer permanent, was forced to train separately from United's first-team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho has frequently been linked with a switch to Serie A. Juventus tried to secure the England international in 2024, while Roma seemed close to finalising a deal for Sancho before he moved to Aston Villa.",
      "The Giallorossi eventually recruited Leon Bailey from the Midlands outfit, instead. His loan arrangement has been cancelled this month, though, to open up a door.",
      "Now, Napoli are the latest club to be attracted by Sancho's abilities, despite his current loan at Villa Park. Antonio Conte's side have included Sancho among their targets, according to Tuttomercatoweb.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Napoli may consider entering the market following a significant setback to their squad, with David Neres set to undergo surgery for a tendon problem and potentially facing two months on the side-lines.",
      "Sancho's contract with United expires at the end of the season, though the club retain the option to extend his agreement by an additional year. Napoli are unlikely to be deterred by Sancho's spell at United - considering the displays they have secured from McTominay and Hojlund.",
      "The former was crowned Serie A's outstanding player following his role in inspiring their championship triumph.",
      "Jadon Sancho has been linked with a transfer to Italian outfit Napoli.(Image: )",
      "Denmark international Hojlund has netted a respectable nine goals in 26 appearances for Napoli - including a vital double against Juventus. That tally already sits just one strike short of his entire output from last season.",
      "For the time being, Sancho remains on loan with Aston Villa, and he found the net for the first time in their colours during a 1-0 triumph over Turkish outfit Fenerbahce, in Thursday night's Europa League encounter. The 25-year-old's 25th-minute header proved the difference and Sancho took a swipe at his former managers afterwards.",
      "The United loanee is thriving under Unai Emery and he remarked: \"It's nice to have a manager who backs you and obviously believes in you. Again, every opportunity I get, I'm going to try and do 100 per cent, and hopefully I can deliver more goals.\"",
      "Speaking last month, amid rumours that Sancho's loan arrangement could be terminated prematurely, Emery also offered his support to the winger. He commented: \"Jadon's still being young.",
      "\"He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But, in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea. He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him, hopefully we can get it.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner will remain at Crystal Palace until the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Oliver Glasner does not regret his “emotional” outburst following Crystal Palace’s defeat to Sunderland but insisted “everything is cleared” with chairman Steve Parish.",
      "The Eagles boss said his side felt “abandoned” with “no support” following that 2-1 loss, Palace’s first match without former captain Marc Guehi, shortly before the defender finalised a move to Manchester City. Parish was forced to consider whether to sack Glasner before his contract expires in the summer and a potential move to Manchester United is on the cards.",
      "Glasner announced last week that he will not sign a new deal with Palace, putting him in the picture for the United job in the summer, when they will appoint a long-term successor to Ruben Amorim. His subsequent rant against the Eagles hierarchy could have spelled the end of his time in south London, but he has cleared the air with Parish.",
      "“No, I don’t regret (it),” said Glasner. “Do I think it was the best way? No, I don’t think so, but that’s Oliver Glasner. I think it’s also a part of what we achieved together, that I’m that emotional. I think it helps to create the spirit, that togetherness, that belief. Sometimes maybe it’s not the best possible way, but that’s me.",
      "“I don’t say I’m perfect. I would like to be. On the other side, I never attacked anyone personally. I just explained my feelings about the situation.”",
      "The Austrian last week confirmed he would be leaving last season’s FA Cup winners, who are on a 10-game winless run across all competitions, when his contract expires at the end of the season. Glasner added: “I don’t regret it because I know how I am, about who I am. I was asked, ‘Do you think, could this happen again?’ I said yes, because that’s how I am.”",
      "The 51-year-old revealed he had a “very long dinner” with co-owner Parish, one he felt was a “very, very good talk for both of us”, though added “nothing changed” about his decision to leave. Glasner also emphasised his issue was not with the idea of selling his captain in principle, but with how the situation was handled.",
      "Marc Guehi's exit to Manchester City annoyed Oliver Glasner(Image: PA)",
      "“One year ago in February I agreed to sell Marc. It’s all about timing and replacement,” Glasner revealed. “I know that Crystal Palace will always sell players if they have big offers from other clubs, but it was just the situation, telling the team 28 hours before a Premier League game that the captain is leaving. This was my feeling at that moment.”",
      "Glasner, who was adamant both he and Parish are “100 per cent committed” to a strong finish to the campaign, believes the situation around wantaway striker Jean-Philippe Mateta is “very clear”.",
      "He added: “He didn’t hand in a transfer request and we have no bid received right now. That is the situation.” But pressed as to whether or not he had informally spoken to the France international about a move away, Glasner would only say: “I speak with many players about different topics, but I think what they deserve is that I don’t tell it publicly.”",
      "Glasner likened the past week to a “thunderstorm” but predicted a brighter forecast, particularly with the returns of Ismaila Sarr, back in the squad after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, and a healthy Daniel Munoz. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson will captain Palace for the remainder of the season, including Sunday’s meeting with Chelsea at Selhurst Park.",

      "Sikou Niakate has shed light on his peculiar reason for halting his football career(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "A filmmaker abandoned his boyhood dream of a football career due to fears about the size of his penis. Sikou Niakate, 34, grew up playing football in Paris and idolising Sir Alex Ferguson 's Manchester United sides.",
      "He aspired to emulate David Beckham and Patrice Evra at Old Trafford, showing promise and even drew comparisons to Manchester City legend Yaya Toure due to his tall frame and style of play. However, Niakate has now revealed how he let go of his dreams of joining a football club because he felt embarrassment about his private parts.",
      "In a fascinating new documentary titled 'Dans le noir, les hommes pleurent' (In the Dark, Men Cry), which addresses issues of masculinity and is available on YouTube, the director recounts two distressing incidents from his youth that fuelled his fear of ever changing in a dressing room. The prospect of communal showering quickly became unthinkable, ending his dreams of a career in football.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, he said: “As a child, I only wanted one thing: to become a footballer. I dreamed of Manchester United, the red shirt, the number 7, David Beckham, and Patrice Evra. I gave everything for it. I played football for at least three hours a day. I was good. Excellent, even. I played midfield, sometimes as a number 10. I was tall, very tall. In middle school, I was already 1.92 m. I was technically gifted. Really technically gifted. Which is rare for a tall guy.",
      "“I had better passing accuracy than all the guys I played with; I was even the one who crossed the ball, even though I was the tallest, because I was so precise. I was a bit like Yaya Touré. I was playing in my neighbourhood, in Paris, in the 19th arrondissement. Naturally, the question of joining a club came up. But that would have meant accepting the idea of communal showers, and for me, that was unthinkable. Impossible. What I was hiding would become visible.”",
      "He had dreams of playing for Manchester United(Image: Wolves via Getty Images)",
      "He explained: “When I was little, one day, I was getting ready to shower while my sister was cleaning the bathroom. We started bickering, she got angry and said to me, laughing, 'With your tiny little d***.' When she said that, those words pierced me, they killed me. I thought I wasn't normal, that my body wasn't beautiful, and that I was going to have to hide it.",
      "“Later, after a football match, one of my friends showed me his penis, for no reason, just as a joke, and asked me to show him mine. His penis was much bigger and I didn't want to. He kept pressuring me, insisting it was weird that I said no. I had no choice. I pulled down my sweatpants and underwear. He looked, held back a laugh, then exploded: 'You have a tiny little d***, it's crazy.'",
      "“I was dying inside. I walked behind him, looking at the ground, head down. I'm a monster. So I decided never to play club football. Never, ever. So maybe when I did play, I was twice as good because I was compensating for not being able to play on a team. I'm not saying I had the talent for a huge career, but I think I could have played for a club, even a good one. But showing myself naked wasn't an option.",
      "Sikou Niakate was ridiculed for his penis size(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "He couldn't step into a communal shower(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "“I talk about the importance of penis size in my documentary, 'In the Dark, Men Cry'. And with all the feedback I received, I realised it affects a huge number of men. It's called 'the locker room syndrome.'",
      "“I used to think I was the only one whose mind was constantly saying, 'How embarrassing to have this body!' It never left me. In middle school, in PE, I always scored between 17 and 20, but when it came to swimming, I got a zero. I never went. It would have meant wearing a swimsuit that would cling to my crotch. Wearing a swimsuit in the shower? Forget about it!",
      "“If I played basketball in a club, it was because I could implement a strategy. I was in a hospitality school at the time. To avoid having to change in the communal locker room, I would explain that I couldn't be there earlier because of my classes and I would arrive after practice had started, still wearing my school suit. On game days, at worst, I had to take off a pair of pants, quickly put on shorts, turn around, talk, create a diversion, but the communal shower was out of the question.",
      "He claimed to play like Yaya Toure [pictured](Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I am aware that penis size has taken on an irrational importance in my life. It's my inner war. Very early on, I told myself, 'I'm finished.' As a child, I looked at my body with profound dislike but I kept telling myself, 'It'll change when I grow up.' I had this utopian vision. After a while, I realised that this body had a taste of permanence, so that utopian vision died and that's when I went very far. I told myself that I absolutely had to change. I researched surgeries and so on.",
      "“I feel like I've been punished by the genetic lottery, like I'm failing in my duty as a man and it shapes every aspect of my life. Obviously, it's excessive; I've seen with my partners how it wasn't an obstacle to pleasure, or even a topic of discussion, that they didn't perceive it the way I did. They would say, 'What are you talking about?' Probably, as a black man, I also thought that my normality had to be excess, that I couldn't just conform to the French norm. I imagine that can fuel a distorted view of oneself.",
      "“Things have gotten better since I've allowed myself to experience some shared intimacy, something that was unthinkable for a long time. But while the public self, the clothed self, is very comfortable, the naked self is much less so.”",

      "Michael Carrick has yet to add to his Manchester United squad in January(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are set to face off in the Premier League this weekend, with the Red Devils eager to showcase continued progress under new manager Michael Carrick.",
      "Arsenal currently sit above United in both the league standings and underlying performance metrics, and they also hold the recent advantage in this fixture, having won the last two league meetings between the sides. Recent form further highlights this gap: Arsenal are unbeaten in their last six matches, recording four wins and two draws, while United have managed two wins, three draws, and one defeat over the same period.",
      "The Gunners are enjoying an impressive unbeaten streak, now stretching to 12 matches with ten victories and two draws. Their home form has been especially formidable, as Mikel Arteta’s men have not lost at the Emirates since May 2025, when Bournemouth claimed a 2-1 win. Defensively, Arsenal have been rock-solid on home soil, ranking among the league’s best for clean sheets and conceding very few goals at the Emirates. Their matches also feature one of the lowest \"both teams to score\" percentages in the division.",
      "Manchester United, on the other hand, arrive with just one win in their last five outings. That victory, however, was a significant one: in Michael Carrick’s managerial debut, United defeated rivals Manchester City 2-0 in a commanding display. While this result offers hope of a new era at Old Trafford, Arsenal’s dominance—especially at home—presents a daunting challenge that may be too great for even an improved United side to overcome.",
      "With Carrick at the helm, United’s recent results may not fully reflect the team’s current trajectory, as the tactical setup has shifted since his arrival. In their last five matches, United have seen both teams score in four games, while only two have featured over 2.5 goals, suggesting a more disciplined defensive approach compared to earlier in the season.",
      "Overall, while Manchester United may be on the rise under new management, Arsenal’s consistency and strength at the Emirates make them firm favourites heading into this weekend’s clash.",
      "Mikel Arteta faces a potential selection headache ahead of this tricky home fixture: should he start Viktor Gyokeres or Gabriel Jesus up front? The likelihood is that Gyokeres will get the nod at the Emirates, as Jesus logged more minutes in midweek against Milan—though he did find the net twice, compared to the Swedish striker’s single goal off the bench. Until recently, Jesus had been limited to substitute appearances as he worked his way back from an ACL injury, but he’s quickly closing the gap on Gyokeres’s goal tally despite having played around 1,400 fewer minutes across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "On the injury front, Riccardo Calafiori, Piero Hincapie, and Max Dowman were all absent from Tuesday night’s squad, casting serious doubt over their availability for the weekend.",
      "For the visitors, Michael Carrick may opt to stick with the same starting XI that secured a statement win over Manchester City last Saturday. Noussair Mazraoui is back in the fold following his Africa Cup of Nations campaign, but the match is likely to come too soon for the injured Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. As a result, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez are expected to continue as the central defensive pairing, unless Carrick decides to give youngsters Leny Yoro or Ayden Heaven a chance on this big stage. At left-back, Luke Shaw should retain his spot unless Patrick Dorgu—who has impressed as an attacking midfielder recently, including in the last match—returns to his former defensive role.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's situation at Manchester United has changed immensely over the past week(Image: Getty)",
      "A bright start to life under Michael Carrick has given Manchester United fresh hope for what to expect from the second half of the season. United rallied to a 2-0 derby victory over Manchester City in Carrick's debut as interim boss, where several stars stood out in particular.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was among those who impressed as he enjoyed his best display of the campaign to date. Not that he had set a particularly high bar after being largely shunned under Carrick's predecessor, Ruben Amorim.",
      "The youngster's absence from the starting XI has seen him widely linked with the exit after contract talks hit an impasse. And there's fresh news over the player's situation as his future begins to take shape.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After not long ago looking destined for the Old Trafford exit, Mainoo's prospects have transformed altogether under Carrick's stewardship. And after just one game with the Champions League-winner in charge, the club are ready to open talks with their 20-year-old midfield gem.",
      "Mainoo's current deal is due to expire in 2027, though United have the option to extend that by a further 12 months. That being said, his salary is minuscule when compared with some of his team-mates, earning a relatively meagre £25,000 a week.",
      "Having failed to start a single league fixture under Amorim this season, Mainoo made a timely comeback at home to City last weekend. And the England international showed the fired boss exactly what he was missing in an iconic result for the Reds.",
      "Mainoo was being linked with the likes of Napoli and Chelsea as recently as this month, but any chance of an exit now seems far less likely. And it seems the more he's given a chance to shine under Carrick, Mainoo may only continue to raise questions as to why Amorim was so reluctant to play him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "On the same day that it emerged United were ready to move ahead in talks with Mainoo, Casemiro announced he'll depart at the end of this season. The Brazil veteran has confirmed he'll be leaving this summer despite the option for an extra year, and he won't be short of suitors, it seems.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" said the South American on Thursday. “From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "Casemiro's departure could also influence Mainoo's future and United's desire to keep the youngster(Image: PA)",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "And that winning mentality is precisely what's attracting a list of admirers as he prepares for free agency. The Daily Mail report Major League Soccer giant LA Galaxy are one such suitor, while clubs in Saudi Arabia and home country Brazil are also understood to be registering interest.",
      "MLS could be of particular interest given franchises are exploring their opportunities to capitalise on the FIFA World Cup boom. However, teams in Brazil and the US would struggle to match the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia, with Casemiro currently United's top earner on £375,000 a week.",

      "But Manchester United and England icon husband David knows exactly what some ex-team-mates think of his wife. Rumours of a familial rift within the Beckham clan have swirled since Brooklyn's 2022 wedding ceremony, when he married actress Nicola Peltz.",
      "Birthday snubs and reported social media blocks followed before the power couple's eldest released a scathing statement online, which included accusations against both of his parents. He specifically accused mother Victoria of trying to \"ruin\" his relationship with Peltz, \"hijacking\" his first dance with her at his wedding and making him feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"humiliated\" with the \"inappropriate\" dancing.",
      "Reports suggest that Victoria is heartbroken by her son's public accusations. Husband David responded to the claims levied at him and his wife, but two of his former team-mates for the Three Lions have already provided a glimpse into Victoria's true personality.",
      "Wayne Rooney is himself a United icon, but he never played alongside David for the Manchester club. He did, however, make 39 appearances for his country with the midfielder.",
      "Speaking on his The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old was asked if he ever met the Beckham family and he recalled a time he and his partner went round to their house for dinner during David's time with Real Madrid",
      "\"We met up with Becks and Victoria, me and Coleen, when he was at Madrid and went for dinner and we were having kebabs,\" said Rooney. \"He's obviously a great lad and Victoria's such a lovely woman and funny. A lot funnier than people would think.\"",
      "David played alongside Rooney for England(Image: Getty)",
      "Michael Owen also starred next to David for the Three Lions but made a handful of appearances alongside him at club level for Real Madrid. One incident that came on the back of the 1998 World Cup helps paint a picture of how Victoria acts towards her husband, who did not enjoy the best of competitions.",
      "Both Owen and Beckham were key members of the England squad that reached the last 16 that year, before a fateful encounter with Argentina. Beckham was infamously sent off in the eventual penalty loss for a kick aimed at Diego Simeone.",
      "Owen's tournament was grand in contrast. He scored the second goal in the Argentina defeat and converted his spot kick. But Beckham was transformed into a national villain for his sending off.",
      "In his autobiography, Owen writes that he later found out Victoria was annoyed with him for not publicly backing David after the red card. This anecdote portrays Victoria as fiercely protective of her husband and family.",
      "David and Owen played together for Real Madrid(Image: The Mirror)",
      "\"I got wind that Victoria was in some way disappointed in me,\" Owen penned. \"She felt, I was told, that while all the limelight was on me after the World Cup, I should have publicly and voluntarily come out and backed David.",
      "\"I didn't consider myself senior enough to pat David Beckham - twenty times more famous than I was at the time - on the back and say, 'Keep your chin up, mate'.",
      "\"Whether I thought his actions lost us the game or not didn't matter. For me, at that time, it was about hierarchy and standing. I was just a junior member of that squad. I was really just a kid.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko looked destined for Arsenal before signing for Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "In a parallel universe, Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko could - and maybe should - be on different sides at the Emirates on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United striker Sesko was so close to joining Arsenal after a long and painstaking transfer pursuit. And maybe, just maybe, United could be getting more out of Gyokeres who has struggled to adapt since his £64m move to Arsenal.",
      "They were two of the most eye-catching deals of the summer when the Premier League went on a huge splurge on strikers. Liverpool broke the bank to sign Alexander Isak for £125m and £79m on Huge Ekitike.",
      "Arsenal finally ended their long pursuit to sign a top class centre forward and put all their money on Gyokeres as they landed the Sweden striker from Sporting Lisbon after he plundered 97 goals in 102 games for the Portuguese giants.",
      "This marked a sharp turn for Arsenal who had previously been chasing Sesko, the young Slovenian striker at RB Leipzig. But the Sesko trail went cold for Arsenal after the arrival of their new sporting director Andrea Berta in March 2025 who almost immediately set his sights on Gyokeres.",
      "There can be no doubt Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta backed Berta’s appointment and has a big say in transfers so they were definitely singing from the same hymn sheet.",
      "The reasoning on Gyokeres over Sesko was that it was all about the here and now. Sesko, still only 22, was young, raw and a work in progress. Gyokeres is 27.",
      "Arsenal wanted an oven ready striker to score goals and get them over the line and winning trophies straight away. It really was that simple.",
      "Arsenal actually came closest to signing Sesko in the summer of 2024. They had strong dialogue with RB Leipzig, Sesko’s agent had been courted and Arsenal were ready to press the button on a deal which would have cost in excess of £45m.",
      "However, it was Sesko who - despite indicating that he wanted to move to the Emirates above anywhere else - wobbled at this stage because he was wary of moving to Arsenal and then having to share striker duties with the likes of Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus.",
      "He felt he would develop more by staying one more year at RB Leipzig who also used the opportunity to renegotiate his contract and insert a far more formal buy-out clause. Arsenal still maintained regular contact through the 2024/25 season.",
      "Even when Edu left and Jason Ayto - who took up the sporting director role on an interim basis and is now at Brighton - the club made regular visits to Germany, kept in touch with the family and agent and did all the things that a club pursuing a hot target do.",
      "But that changed when Berta came in. The regular trips tailed off and it became obvious that Sesko was no longer the stand-alone candidate. He was still in the mix but Berta was championing Gyokeres.",
      "Andrea Berta pounded the table to bring Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal(Image: (Photo by Jacques Feeney/Offside/Offside via Getty Images))",
      "However, it is fair to say that when Arsenal moved on Gyokeres, both RB Leipzig and Sesko were left high and dry. The German club were banking on his exit. Suddenly it looked far from certain.",
      "Sporting were not happy with Arsenal (who, in fairness, were just trying to do what every club does by driving a hard bargain) and it soon became clear the Portuguese club were pushing Gyokeres towards Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres had played under former United boss Ruben Amorim at Sporting but the Swede made it clear he was not interested. At that stage, maybe he was more suited to United’s playing style than Arsenal because he is more focal point than pressing machine.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko rejected Newcastle and it has been reported that, despite the Slovenian then setting his sights on Old Trafford, Amorim was not entirely convinced and wanted a more experienced striker. Gyokeres might have been a better fit.",
      "United ended up paying £74m for potential in Sesko with Arsenal paying £64m for Gyokeres.",
      "Sesko has taken some time to adapt - but there is confidence he will come good in the long run(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The United fan base are split on Sesko. Scouts still maintain that because of his age, athleticism and pace, he will come good and be a prolific centre forward. But, tellingly, Sesko was only on the bench for Michael Carrick’s first game in charge of United and they beat Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Arsenal fans have been supportive of Gyokeres. But, despite his super strike against Inter Milan in the Champions League, he has really struggled. He does not look on the same technical level as his teammates, he has not scored enough and looks sluggish.",
      "Back in August, Sesko and Gyokeres did not even share minutes on the pitch when Arsenal beat United 1-0. Sesko was a 65th minute substitute and Gyokeres was hooked after an hour.",
      "You suspect both will have a point to prove if they do go head-to-head on Sunday when Arsenal and United will also be determined to show they ended up with the right striker.",

      "Manchester United have launched an internal investigation to try and find out how Michael Carrick's starting XI for the clash with Man City was revealed online before kick-off. The Red Devils have had long-standing issues with information leaking out of the club and have launched several internal probes before.",
      "Carrick would pick up three points in his first game in interim charge, with Patrick Dorgu and Bryan Mbeumo finding the back of the net at Old Trafford. Team leaks are not a new problem for United and have been ongoing for almost 10 years.",
      "Jose Mourinho, who also suffered with the problem, publicly acknowledged it by making a quip in a press conference before the 2018 FA Cup final. Carrick has not commented on the issue, which reared its head again last weekend, but Ruben Amorim's tenure was also plagued by leaks and led to frustration.",
      "Now, The Sun claims the club has launched an investigation in an effort to find the mole after the starting XI accurately appeared online hours before last week's derby victory.",
      "Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Casemiro, Amad and Mbeumo all returned to the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha dropped to the bench. It was a move that paid off, with Carrick utilising Dorgu on the left-hand side of the attack.",
      "United dominated the game and moved close to the top four, following Liverpool's draw with Burnley at the weekend.",
      "This is not the first time the club have looked into the source of the leaks. The Red Devils reportedly launched an inquiry in December into how Amorim's intentions to change his system came out on the day of a fixture against Bournemouth.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The Mail reported at the time that United were determined to identify who was offering up inside information to stop such occurrences from repeating themselves in future. A club spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "United were also reported to have been 'furious' in September following suggestions that Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes is 'unhappy'.",
      "The club's team line-up was also revealed well ahead of the Manchester derby in December 2024.",
      "\"I know that story,\" Amorim said at the time. \"I don't know, I think it's impossible to fix nowadays because you have a lot of people in the club, the players talk with agents.",
      "\"I don't know, you can talk with friends, so it's hard to know. It's not a good thing, but let's move on and go to the next one and see if they find the next starting XI.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim saw his Manchester United formation change leaked before a game against Bournemouth(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Countless other stories surfaced last season, including those regarding squad issues and team news, with United's senior management taking steps to identify the source of the leaks within the camp.",
      "Previous managerial tenures at M16, under Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Mourinho, were similarly impacted by leaks. While it clearly presents a major problem at United, Carrick's focus will now be on preparing his side for the Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Speaking about the upcoming challenge, United's interim boss said: \"I am looking forward to the game. It's a big challenge. They are a very good team. It is pretty obvious to say that, they have so many strong points to their game. It is a big challenge.",
      "\"They are where they are for a reason in the Champions League, we are fully aware of that and not taking that lightly at all. We feel we are in a good place and we go there looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It is where we want to be; we want to be positive with that energy and enthusiasm, but we know it is not going to be easy.",

      "Dealing with arguably the greatest manager of all time was a unique experience, with press conference bans and blasts of Fergie's infamous 'hairdryer' temper a regular occupational hazard.",
      "Indeed, if you hadn't been banned by Fergie, you were not deemed to be doing your job properly.",
      "Despite his fierce public persona, there was a lighter side to Fergie. After leading United to the title in 2013 before stepping down, champagne was poured for reporters at his press conference.",
      "As ever with Fergie, there was a sting in the tail, waiting until everybody had taken a sip before delivering the killer line: \"Don't worry, I've got the police waiting at the end of the road to breathalyse you all!\"",
      "‌When the Mirror reported a spy plane flying low over United’s training ground, to get intel on their tactics, Fergie could not resist a playful dig.",
      "When I asked Fergie about the plane, he burst into laughter. “I saw you flying it,” he said, using his hands as a pair of flying goggles. “I could see you up there - Biggles McDonnell! Biggles of the Mirror!”",
      "Nothing will beat Sergio Aguero's last-gasp winner against QPR to win Man City the title(Image: PA)",
      "A succession of managers have tried and failed to emulate his remarkable success and, as Fergie's reign was coming to an end, the Blue Moon was rising on the other side of Manchester.",
      "City emerged from the shadow of their more illustrious neighbours to begin a period of their own domestic domination and emulated United's 1999 Treble triumph in 2023, under the peerless Pep Guardiola.",
      "For sheer drama, nothing beats Sergio Aguero's 94th-minute winner for City to snatch the title on goal difference from local rivals United with virtually the last kick of the 2011-12 season, with the Red Devils already celebrating another famous triumph.",
      "The best game? A tough one, given there have been so many epic encounters, but it probably has to be the breathless Manchester derby of 2009, a Michael Owen goal in added time sealing a dramatic 4-3 win for United at Old Trafford, after which Fergie infamously branded City the “noisy neighbours”.",
      "Michael Owen's winner against Man City a Old Trafford in 2009(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The best goal? Again, too many to choose from, but for sheer audacity and technical brilliance, Wayne Rooney's spectacular 35-yard volley against Newcastle in 2005, while Cristiano Ronaldo's bullet header away to Roma in 2008 – I still can't fathom how he made up so much ground to reach the ball – remains an iconic goal.",
      "So after more than 1,000 games at home and abroad, six World Cups, three European Championships and 23 pre-season tours, not to mention half a dozen bans from Fergie, the time has come to say farewell.",

The 16-year-old, the eldest of Wayne and Coleen's four children, has hinted he could make his Old Trafford debut on Friday night when Manchester United U18s take on Derby County in the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Ahead of the fourth round tie, Kai posted a throwback photo on Instagram featuring himself and his dad, both in United kits, on the pitch from about a decade ago. His cryptic caption \"OT\", accompanied by heart and staring eyes emojis, suggests he's set to step onto the Old Trafford pitch as a player for the first time, which would be a proud moment for the Rooneys.",
      "Kai, who celebrated his 16th birthday in November, has recently graduated to the under-18 squad, which is managed by Darren Fletcher. However, his matches so far haven't been held at Old Trafford, as youth games are typically played at Leigh Sports Village or the club's Carrington training complex.",
      "With the first team playing away at Arsenal on Sunday, Old Trafford is available. While Kai is undoubtedly a promising talent, Wayne and Coleen have been careful not to pile on any pressure on him or their other sons.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "They've made it clear that there's no expectation for their boys to follow in their dad's legendary footsteps. Speaking to the Mirror in September 2024, Coleen said: \"We've never pressured them into even playing football. We've always just let them decide what they want to do.",
      "\"My eight-year-old was playing and doing really well but then decided he didn't want to, and that's OK.",
      "\"I think they sometimes get pressure off other people, you know. People approach them now and then if we're out, they do say, 'Are you are as good as your dad?'",
      "\"Kai says 'I'm a different type of player.' You've got to let them know that you don't have to follow and to be your own person.\"",
      "Kai is now under the guidance of Fletcher, who has made his way back to the youth academy after his brief spell as interim first-team manager following Ruben Amorim's sacking earlier this month.",
      "Kai shared this picture on his Instagram feed ahead of United's youth team game at Old Trafford(Image: kairooney.10/Instagram)",
      "Michael Carrick has taken the reins until the summer, with former England assistant Steve Holland brought in as his deputy. Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans have also joined the coaching ranks.",
      "The new coaching unit enjoyed a dream start as United stormed to a superb 2-0 victory over Manchester City last weekend thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",

It’s a bit of a cliche for a defensive holding midfielder to be underrated, but honestly he’s been so important – notably, he had edged ahead of Tielemans and Rogers in chat to be Villa’s player of the season recently; until Paulinha accidentally injured him in a completely fair challenge during his in no way unhinged FA Cup rampage.",
      "And this in an area of the team that is in trouble anyway: McGinn won’t be back until possibly March. Onana played last night, which means he’s got 3 more games in him max until Easter. We’ll probably see Gnarls Barkley in a Villa shirt before Ross. Bogarde and Hemmings are very useful defensive mids, but both are young enough to think the Makelele Role is a Frederick Forsyth novel (obviously Frederick Forsyth novels are massive with Gen Z). Tielemans, Son of Unai, is more than happy trying to do too much a la Bruno Fernandes/Victoria Beckham, but if he gets injured we are proper screwed. So the midfield is *stretched*.",
      "But the main thing with Kamara is: our record with him vs without is pretty stark. The last time we lost a prem game with him in the team was Liverpool away on 1 November; otherwise, with him in the team we’ve played 6 other games against Big 6 teams and won 6. (And Wolves, which may not seem much but it has been hard work for us over the years, including this season until Bouba banged in a Rogers special).",
      "The last 3 league games he missed were Everton last weekend, Arsenal in December and Palace in August – we lost all 3 by an aggregate score of 8-1, even with the easier 2 games being at home. And the only cup games we’ve lost – Brentford in the Carabao and GAE in the Eurovision – were Kamara-free as well.

      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",

      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",
      "",
      "Burnley are in the mire but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 22 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo. And dropped a bollock against Everton.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs.

Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",

      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",

      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",

      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save. Newcastle gave him little more to do.",

      "The Red Devils moved up to fifth in the Premier League but remain 15 points behind Arsenal, who are the current leaders, with Mikel Arteta’s side seven points ahead of nearest rivals Man City and Aston Villa.",
      "Man Utd travel to the Emirates Stadium over the weekend in a much different test with Arsenal losing just two matches all season, both away from home.",
      "And Merson is expecting a very comfortable victory for Arsenal despite Carrick’s impressive victory over City in his first fixture.",

      "“Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Jesus scoring against Inter is great news for Arsenal. I think Gyokeres needs to come off the bench in the next few games. When the defenders are tired, the game will open up for him and he can make an impact. So it’s better if he comes on for the final 20 minutes.",

      "“If you told me I had to bet on one team to win this weekend, I’d actually go Arsenal. Everything points to a win for Mikel Arteta’s men here. They are just so good at home. 29 points from 11 games at the Emirates. Even when they looked so bad against Liverpool, they did not lose.",

      "We could (quite fairly) be accused of erring on the side of negativity here at Football365. We revel in the rubbish and are often guilty of failing to bask in the brilliance we see on a regular basis in the Premier League.",
      "We’ve selected the most overrated players, the very worst player at each club and enjoy calling out big-money signings for an entirely reasonable struggle to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But sometimes it’s nice to be nice, and so here are the revelations of the season, the players who have surprised us with their excellence – one per club.",
      "",
      "He must have been cursing his misfortune upon his arrival last season when Myles Lewis-Skelly enjoyed one of the most stratospheric rises to prominence in recent memory, to such a degree that Calafiori was linked with an exit in the summer, 12 months on from his arrival for £42m.",
      "But he’s made the left-back position in his own in the Premier League this term, combining near faultless defensive displays with no small amount of attacking threat. Being a big lad certainly hasn’t hurt him in his successful usurping of the academy star.",
      "",
      "An honourable mention for the Lazarus of the West Midlands, Matty Cash, who we thought was finished but has played nearly every minute under Unai Emery this term, scoring in the victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. But the new level Rogers has found this season gives him the edge; his knuckleball deserves its own section.",
      "Jude Bellingham or Rogers for England? Could genuinely be a toss-up.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ graded by football analysis experts Gradient Sports",
      "Seven Premier League goals in 646 minutes for the teenager, who’s got the best minutes per goal rate (92.3) of any player in the top flight this season, with Erling Haaland (95) second. The ‘New Kylian Mbappe’ tag doesn’t seem quite so silly now.",
      "",
      "Sixteen goals is at least 14 more goals than we expected from the £30m summer signing who scored 18 in what must actually be The Best League In The World for Club Brugge in 2023/24.",
      "",
      "His ability to thread passes through opposition teams is arguably unmatched in the Premier League and he also loves a battle with a centre-forward, as Haaland found out earlier this month. Quite weird that there’s not more interest in his service from the Big Six vultures. Surely only a matter of time.",
      "",
      "Eight goals in the Championship last season, Anthony’s already got five in the Premier League, including home and away against Manchester United and at the Etihad vs Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Him being fit is a revelation in itself but the way in which he’s developed as a central midfielder has also been remarkable. That move from right-back – which we questioned like many others – may end up being Enzo Maresca’s most crucial and enduring Chelsea legacy. His performance against Arsenal in that role was extraordinary.",
      "",
      "His level has dropped along with the rest of his teammates of late, but the 29-year-old put in several hugely impressive all-round displays when it was still worth getting up in the morning at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Few would have predicted Garner as Xavi Simons’ answer to a question about which Premier League player has surprised him most – “technical with the ball, he’s really, really good” – or that midway through the season we would be seeing a (bit of a) clamour for him to be called up by Thomas Tuchel for England amid questions as to whether Manchester United should re-sign him as an answer to the midfield conundrum.",

      "Surely the biggest Premier League revelation of all with his eight goals and five assists for Fulham. And he so very nearly made a deadline-day move to Leeds – a private jet was pre-emptively booked before talks broke down.",

      "Nine Premier League goals, eight of which have come in a run of nine games after Daniel Farke changed formation to stick another striker up top with him. The England clamour is real.",
      "",
      "Slim picking it’s fair to say but 12 goals in all competitions is a decent return for a striker most of us assumed wouldn’t get much of a look in this season.",
      "",
      "We assumed he was destined to be one of those ten-a-penny wingers who get close to the top by being very, very quick but not quite having it in the top two inches, but he’s developed his game to the point where he doesn’t just look like he could and should make the difference but actually does.",
      "",
      "There’s life in the old dog yet as this particular old dog is evidently desperate to represent his country at the World Cup, before seeing out his days lying balls-up on the sofa, only rising from his slumber for meals and to curl the occasional one out in the back garden, probably in Saudi Arabia.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe described Kieran Trippier’s “spontaneous” decision to hand Miley the armband for the final few minutes of their clash with PSV on Wednesday as “poignant” and also quite possibly a sign of what’s to come, dubbing the 19-year-old a “potential future captain of the football club”.",
      "There was a time – maybe even only a few weeks ago – when an injury to Bruno Guimaraes would have been an utter disaster for Newcastle. But the outstanding versatility and quality shown by Miley this season makes his absence feel manageable at the very least.",
      "",
      "You pal down the pub claiming they always knew Anderson would emerge as the answer to that age-old England problem is almost certainly telling porky pies. His Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from £28m to £52m this season and that’s likely around half of what Manchester City will pay for his services after he conducts England to World Cup glory in the summer.",
      "",
      "There are few things we like more than a Premier League giant selling an academy star to a lower-league team before they return to the top flight to rub the mistake in their face. It’s a shame for us vengeance seekers that Ballard’s boyhood club Arsenal might be the only Premier League side he wouldn’t start for based on his outstanding form this season.",
      "",
      "He does next-to-nothing to help his side keep hold of the ball or get up the pitch, which is entirely as expected, but has also scored seven Premier League goals when we assumed he would be fortunate to score any as a bit-part player before escaping in January.",
      "",
      "We liked what we saw of him for Southampton last season, but it takes quite some mental fortitude not to crumble in this West Ham team, playing in that stadium, in front of those fans. Two relegations in two seasons won’t feel great, but Real Madrid interest in triggering his not-so-secret £20m release clause will.",
      "",
      "The only positive Wolves can take away from this season and the fans will if anything not want him to display too much more of his burgeoning talent for the rest of the campaign, lest he be pinched by a club set to still be playing Premier League football next term.",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy has explained why he thinks only one team is capable of stopping Arsenal winning the Champions League this season.",

      "Ornstein revealed in conversation with Duncan Castles on The Transfers Podcast: “Carrick will naturally enter the conversation depending on how well he does. But I don’t think this is binary, as it was with Ole Gunner Solskjaer. United should run their process properly: speak to available coaches, assess those in work where permitted, look at data, styles and profiles.",
      "“Last time, it came down to Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag. Others like Frank and Pochettino were considered. There are weeks and months now to do that work. Carrick could play himself into contention, or he might decide it’s not the right moment.",
      "“There’s nothing firm right now. It’s hypothetical. But given his qualities, what he showed in his brief United spell before, and his work at Middlesbrough, there’s no reason he shouldn’t at least be in the conversation – much like Kieran McKenna was previously.",
      "“Carrick could be in the mix, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job. It’s very much a case of wait and see how it unfolds.”",
      "And Ornstein thinks Carrick ticks one crucial box for the Man Utd hierarchy as they look to bring in the right man to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "Ornstein added: “I also understand why United went for a figure with a connection to the club. Lifting spirits, restoring smiles and confidence matters, even if it sounds trite. It’s not everything, but it helps.",

      "After being on the bench for much of the season, Kobbie Mainoo started his first Premier League match of the campaign under Michael Carrick last Saturday and the England international could now be a key midfielder moving forward.",

      "As a Man United fan, 4-4-2 raised me. Two proper strikers (even though early Rooney and Ronaldo as mutated 10s and 9s still give me chills). Wingers who actually crossed and celebrated acrobatically after goals. Fullbacks who knew their only job was ‘run and vibes’. This formation won leagues, broke Arsenal (a fave past time), and made defenders fear actual human beings instead of inverted zombies.",

      "For a tactic United used to destroy teams in its heyday, there are inherent flaws. You know the ones: your midfield gets overrun by a single guy called ‘#8’, and opponents build up with 7 players while your two strikers are socially distancing.",
      "Even Sir Alex Ferguson saw 4-4-2 and thought ‘ah yes, free central zones’. If it were used today, Bruno would be doing three people’s jobs, Sesko would be isolated, and Casemiro would look like he was guarding Tesco’s parking lot by himself.",
      "4-4-2 will always have a special place in my heart, right next to Yorke and Cole. But football moved on, and so did the world.

      "Dear Editors",
      "In my view, much has been made of Arsenal’s reliance on set pieces this season, as evidence of a limited / pragmatic / neanderthal approach (take your pick). I think this misunderstands both the cause and the context.",
      "For the last decade and a half, elite football was dominated by positional, ball-heavy systems (70% possession, extreme technical prowess, territory control, cut-backs from the edge of the box) perfected by Guardiola’s genius. The natural response to that dominance for teams with lesser (but not insignificant) resources was resistance: better-coached mid-blocks, aggressive man-marking, and sophisticated rest-defence structures, especially among mid-table PL sides (who, remember, have more money and thus better players – not comparable to the best teams tactically, but fit for purpose of the type of game they planned to play).",
      "In other words, the league got better at stopping positional football.",
      "That tactical shift reduced open-play volume for everyone, including Arsenal (remember the fluent team of 22-23). Set pieces, IMO, are not the cause of this evolution but a rational response to it. Arsenal and a few others (notably Chelsea) have leaned into them because they are one of the few remaining repeatable advantages against compact, well-drilled defences.",
      "Arteta’s use of set pieces, to me, looks less like dogma and more like a stopgap i.e. an efficient (if not aesthetic) solution while the next attacking evolution is being worked out. Guardiola, interestingly, has not yet leaned into that lever to the same extent. His old road’s rapidly agin’, but if anyone can come up with an elegant solution, it’s him.",
      "The broader point is this: set-piece dominance is not evidence of regression. It is evidence of adaptation in a league where defensive organisation has finally caught up with positional purity (and I would say bettered it). A more elegant attacking solution will emerge. It always does. But dismissing the current phase as ‘set-piece FC’ misses the tactical story entirely.",

The point of using Dynasty as a term was not that it was a direct alternative to ‘DNA’ but because DNA is being used so ephemerally, with no concrete concepts other than attacking and exciting (which any team could say they want and have had iterations of their team that have done that before), but that Dynasty implies a one-time event.  It doesn’t flow over to a later version of the team 10, 20 or more years later. Whether we like ‘Americanisations’ or not, it better reflects what happens for teams that dominate an era than DNA. Especially when it is trotted out, again, after one win. My other point was that the confidence that oozed through a team of round pegs in round holes was far more instrumental in the win than DNA.",

      "Arsenal v Man United and Newcastle v Aston Villa are games that give us all a chance to stop and consider just how much things have changed since August, while also confirming that, for the millionth Premier League weekend in a row, it is once again officially Big. A Big Weekend.",
      "There’s also Mo Salah back in Premier League action post-AFCON, while who knows how many more chances we have left to enjoy Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace before he huffs right off for good?",
      "",
      "A fun thing about this weekend is that it’s the return fixtures from the opening game of the season. It’s just nice to see how different teams’ seasons have panned out and what clues or misdirections were evident back in the sunny days of August.",
      "At Old Trafford on the first Super Sunday of the season, Arsenal ran out slightly fortunate 1-0 winners in a game that prompted significant outpourings of optimism from home supporters despite the result.",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, offered only unconvincing early evidence that this could at long last be their season, and Viktor Gyokeres looked like he might be a dud.",
      "It soon became clear that Man United were still quite cack, and that it was in fact Arsenal’s season. Good call on Gyokeres, though, who is truly Dud of Dud Hall.",
      "Ruben Amorim has gone, of course, and Michael Carrick continues his gentle start to life as United’s latest sacrificial Fergie Boy by attempting to follow up last weekend’s Arsenal-assisting win over Man City with a Man City-assisting win over Arsenal.",
      "If he does it, they’ll probably give him the permanent job on the spot, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "More likely is that Arsenal win in rather more convincing fashion than they did at Old Trafford and it all takes a little while longer before Carrick manages to stumble home in fifth and claim a Champions League spot on the back of the effort of the teams who are actually in it this season. And then gets appointed to the permanent job, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "Arsenal will by that point have long been crowned champions, with the bald truth that there really doesn’t seem like there’s much anyone else in the division can do about it. The bigger question is how many other pots and pans they might take home.",
      "",
      "Let’s continue the theme of August reminiscences, because in few places would the contrast appear more initially stark than at Aston Villa.",
      "They began the season with a grim goalless draw against the Newcastle side that had pipped them to Champions League football on the final day of 24/25 in a game that very much continued the trending themes at the time for two clubs who had endured awkward and unsatisfactory summers.",
      "For Villa it would set a trend that would extend into September and a five-game winless run to start the season that didn’t even contain a goal until that fifth game.",
      "Then they just won pretty much all the games for an extended period of time to become brief yet genuine title contenders.",
      "But the reopening of the transfer window has brought back familiar doubts and truths, and despite Villa occupying an enviable position in the table and appearing certainties for Champions League football next season there is now once again a distinct sense of a buzz harshed.",
      "Frustration at rules that bind them while being more easily navigated by the established big clubs, of simply not being allowed to compete on even terms with Newcastle, never mind the cosseted Big Six. Even the stupidest members of that group are annoying Villa. Especially the stupidest members.",
      "A look at the table suggests this angst is misplaced; Villa remain closer to Arsenal than they do to fifth place, which will almost certainly be enough to achieve what Villa set out to achieve this season and which they looked a million miles away from doing back in August.",
      "But time and results and other factors all have a funny way of shifting those sands beneath your feet. And with a slight dip in results and the return of the transfer window with its now familiar frustrations, there’s just a nagging sense that Villa are neither as happy as they should be, nor as they were just a few short weeks ago.",
      "",
      "Liverpool’s wildly unconvincing yet improbably lengthy unbeaten run featured a rarity on Wednesday night, as a truly convincing performance put a dangerous Marseille side to the sword in a richly deserved 3-0 triumph.",
      "Liverpool impressed from front to back, while Arne Slot got pretty much everything right as well in dealing with an awkward and ever-shifting opponent.",
      "But perhaps the best thing about the night for Liverpool was that at the end of it almost nobody was talking about Mo Salah. He went straight into the starting line-up on his return from AFCON and had neither an eye-catchingly good nor poor game – there was one glaring late miss which he somehow contrived to send away from goal rather than towards it, but apart from that.",
      "Yet it didn’t ever really feel like it was of desperate importance. It would have seemed mad to think a month ago when Salah left for AFCON with his entire Liverpool future seemingly up in the air that his return six weeks later could be so low-key, such a footnote on a night of good news.",
      "His first Premier League appearance since December 13 is likely to attract more eyeballs and greater attention, though. We eagerly await to discover what kind.",
      "",
      "We now know for sure it’s when not if as far as Glasner’s Palace exit is concerned. Technically it’s not supposed to happen until the end of the season, but it feels absurd to suggest this now clearly broken marriage can stagger on that long. Especially if Palace continue on their current downward trajectory that sees them without a Premier League win in their last seven games and suffering the FA Cup’s biggest ever giant-killing.",
      "Carrying on doesn’t look like it’s going to do much good for either Palace or Glasner in the long run. Palace find themselves now slipping uncomfortably close to the fringes of relegation bother, while continuing with Palace for much longer could yet see Glasner play himself out of what currently looks like a near-certain shot at a Big Six job next season.",
      "It’s not inconceivable that four of that group could be seeking a new permanent manager in the summer, and Glasner is high in the lists for all of those jobs.",
      "But he won’t be if he spends the next three months angrily losing to everyone to prove his undeniably valid point about the lack of support he’s received.",
      "If he’s not careful, he’ll end up with Tottenham as his best option, which would be a real daftness in the current climate.",
      "",
      "Funny old time for Middlesbrough, who are busy trying to get themselves back into the Premier League while watching their two most recent managers getting themselves appointed into it.",
      "Michael Carrick has failed upwards to Manchester United, while Rob Edwards surely couldn’t have imagined an undeniably impressive few months at the Riverside would so swiftly get him back in the big time.",
      "Boro have kept on keeping on, though, under Kim Hellberg and still firmly in the hunt for automatic promotion with the play-offs looking like a worst-case safety net.",
      "Preston are themselves still very much part of that picture, still just inside the top six going into this weekend despite consecutive defeats to Derby and Hull. This does feel like a pivotal spell of the season for their promotion hopes; after Boro comes another trip to a team eyeing an automatic return to the Premier League in Ipswich.",
      "",
      "Still an absurd amount of life left in the Serie A title race, where Inter now appear solid favourites but Roma down in fourth are still only seven points adrift and not without their chances.",
      "They surely can’t afford to slip 10 points off Inter’s pace and also fall seven points adrift of Milan this weekend, though. Victory over the team in second would lift them within a single point of Milan, which itself seems an oddity given Milan have lost one league game all season while Roma have already lost seven.",

Spurs are level on points with them, and Man United only a point further back in what appears to be a three-horse race for the final Champions League spot.",
      "With Spurs facing bottom-of-the-table Liverpool this weekend and United doing so next weekend, Arsenal could do really do with a result this weekend to keep them at bay.",

      "Signed from Real Madrid for over £60million in August 2022, Casemiro penned a four-year contract, with the option of an additional year, worth more than £300,000 per week.",
      "At the time, the Erik ten Hag signing was viewed as a solid one. Casemiro had established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world at Madrid, where he won five Champions League titles.",

The offer being prepared in Riyadh surpasses any known standard, both in salary and media impact.",
      "‘Al Hilal wants Bruno to be the face of their international project, a symbolic signing that would reinforce the Saudi league’s image as a destination for established stars. For the Portuguese player, the offer would be virtually impossible to refuse from a financial standpoint, placing him among a select few footballers in history.’",
      "It is also said that the final decision regarding Fernandes hinges on three ‘factors’; ‘the sporting project presented by Manchester United, Bayern Munich’s ability to entice him with their competitive offerings, and, above all, the size of the Saudi Arabian offer’.",

They will need a replacement ready to come in and light up Old Trafford and Palmer is one of very few we would fancy to thrive in that spotlight.",

      "Palmer has played off the right flank for Chelsea but, unquestionably, he is best used centrally. The same is true, though, of the Blues’ £107million Argentinian investment. And Rosenior is unlikely to grant Palmer the freedom to roam off the right that Mauricio Pochettino afforded him in 2023/24.",
      "Not only could United offer Palmer his Manchester home comforts – assuming that is as relevant as some are suggesting – but if Fernandes is not long for Old Trafford, the no.10 position would be his.",

      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there. But could someone else still beat Frank to the finish? Oliver Glasner and, even more interestingly, Pep Guardiola are now very much involved in the conversation.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",

      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",

      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but still five points away despite West Ham collecting the inevitable from a trip to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers.

      "After the latest check on the pulse of the nation with regard to Mason Greenwood’s return to Manchester United, we can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by the possibility and that it’s still really not OK.",
      "It’s an uncomfortable truth that football journalists are now all too aware of that Greenwood is a name which does good business. In part because he’s an excellent footballer who looks destined for great(er) things, but also because of the manner of his exit from Old Trafford and how his possible return continues to split opinion.",
      "Greenwood faced charges for rape and assault in October 2022 but the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the case against him four months later after the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction. He was not – as Greenwood said in a statement afterwards – “cleared” of the charges. We all heard the audio.",
      "Manchester United tested the waters. They gave inside scoops detailing his reintegration into the squad and were met with disgust from fans and (some) members of the media.",
      "In a lengthy statement, Female Fans Against Greenwood’s Return said the possible return of Greenwood “tells us, as women, that we don’t matter”.",
      "It added: “It tells us that men who make the club money matter; not us, our fellow fans, mothers, sisters or daughters.”",
      "To avoid a PR disaster, Greenwood was sent to Getafe on a season-long loan, before – after further suggestions that he may return to Man Utd were shot down – he was sold to Marseille for £26m in the summer of 2024.",
      "And now 42 goals in 63 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, links to Barcelona and Premier League alternatives, and sell-on and buy-back clauses combine to make his future a particularly intriguing prospect for click-hungry websites. We’re aware that we’re having and eating cake.",
      "Thursday morning saw multiple old Greenwood articles re-nosed for publication. What’s ‘Tuchel’s stance on an England recall’? Still a hard no. We particularly enjoyed Jurgen Klopp ‘making his feelings clear on Greenwood’ as one outlet looked to crowbar two of the most Google-able names into the same headline.",
      "The flurry was no coincidence. Editors will have been on at their minions to push Greenwood on the back of him facing Liverpool for Marseille last night, sensing an opportunity for traffic with him front of mind for more English fans than usual. They will have been praying for a goal or two from the 24-year-old to provide a further boost.",
      "One report claims ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club’. Who says? ‘Sources’ do. Could be groundsman No. 5 or – because it’s not ‘club sources’, just ‘sources’ – literally anyone. I’m a source, you’re a source.",
      "That’s preferential on a moral level than if the ‘news’ has come from inside Manchester United, as that would suggest that they are again looking to gauge public opinion over his possible return. Newsflash guys: it’s never going to change.",
      "People who believe he deserves a second chance and that everyone makes mistakes, who sign up to the view that ‘she’s OK with it so why aren’t you?’ left their morals at the door long ago and aren’t about to recover them.",
      "Those of us who see the preservation of his career as a stain on football and want the verified social media accounts championing him to get in the bin aren’t about to forgive and forget on the basis of him scoring quite a lot of goals.",
      "Just to be clear: It will never be okay for Manchester United to re-sign Mason Greenwood.",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United in the summer. His estimated cost to the club £119m. The Athletic asks whether he was worth it",
      "By Mark Critchley, The Athletic",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 18:41, UK",
      "Spending at least £60m in transfer fees on a 30-year-old, giving him a salary of up to £350,000-per-week, and signing him to a four-year contract with the option of a further 12 months would not typically be viewed as cost-effective business.",
      "That is at least partly why Manchester United will not be triggering said option in Casemiro's contract. His Old Trafford career will instead come to an end this summer, as had long been expected.",
      "Once he says goodbye, after adding to his 146 appearances, many will hold up Casemiro's time in Manchester as another symbol of United's waste and extravagance in the transfer market, and a starry-eyed infatuation with big-name, big-money players who arrive well past their peak.",
      "There is undoubtedly some truth to that, but even if he may not have been a particularly smart signing, Casemiro was arguably a necessary one. And though four seasons of a five-time Champions League winner was never going to come cheap, it would also be unfair to dismiss him as a costly mistake.",
      "If anything, the cost was a symptom of United's desperation and dysfunction during Erik ten Hag's tumultuous first summer in charge, with his signing from Real Madrid being quickly accelerated after back-to-back defeats in their opening Premier League games.",
      "The long, protracted and painful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong had run aground by that point. Champions League qualification needed to be delivered at all costs.",
      "Ultimately, it was, thanks in no small part to Casemiro. For that first year in Manchester, certainly for the first six months of his Old Trafford career, he was considered a transformative addition.",
      "The arrival of one of the best No 6s of his generation finally addressed a longstanding problem at the base of midfield. Even if his age meant he was not going to be a long-term solution, his quality and experience meant he was a quick, effective fix.",
      "At his best for United, around the time of the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that February, he was being uncontroversially hailed in some quarters as the club's most important signing since Eric Cantona.",
      "Casemiro's second season was much more of a struggle, though, and has coloured perceptions of his United career away from Old Trafford. On several occasions, he no longer looked capable of keeping up with the pace of the Premier League, and those stuck in the craw.",
      "Though far from the only player to have difficulties meeting the demands of Ten Hag's increasingly helter-skelter style of play, it did him absolutely no favours as a holding midfielder on the wrong side of 30 and exposed the short-termism of his signing.",
      "He didn't, though. And even after being cast to the peripheries by Ten Hag's successor, at one stage finding himself behind a 21-year-old Toby Collyer in the pecking order, his dedication and determination to win back his place led him to practically become an ever-present again. From then on, he was an example Ruben Amorim would constantly tell his other players to follow.",
      "Last week, The Athletic revealed that Casemiro's option would be automatically triggered if he started every remaining game this season. The chances of that were remote. Even if United had been open to another year, even if their shrinking budgets could afford it, injury or suspension would likely have got in the way. But on form alone, it was not such an outlandish prospect.",
      "Casemiro has started 19 of 24 matches in all competitions this season, including all but one of the Premier League games that he has been available for. Despite the justified clamour for Kobbie Mainoo to be given more opportunities, few argued that should come at the 33-year-old's expense.",
      "When part of more compact and conservative tactical setups than Ten Hag's, he has generally looked capable of continuing to play at a high level.",
      "His considerable threat from set pieces has left him with a respectable tally of 21 goals since joining. And though he could be erratic with his passing, there were often nights over the past three and a half years when he looked like the only United player other than Bruno Fernandes capable of creating something.",
      "Thursday's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season followed a man-of-the-match display in the 198th Manchester derby. It was only the latest example that Casemiro still has something to offer United, albeit not on his current pay packet.",
      "Even without the one-year option triggered, a rough estimate puts the minimum cost to United of first signing and then keeping Casemiro for the past four seasons at £119m ($160m). Was it worth it? Opinions will vary.",
      "But here's something more of us can agree on: United have been a better team when Casemiro is playing. This season, especially. And now, he must be replaced.",
      "There is a different set of decision-makers in place at Old Trafford compared to the summer of 2022, and they will surely look for a younger and more athletic midfielder, with a higher ceiling in terms of what they can achieve as a United player, and a higher resale value if they fall short of that mark. A smarter signing, we'll all surely agree.",
      "Like Casemiro, that midfielder - whether it is Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or another target - won't come cheap. And to avoid any sort of drop-off next season, they will need to be as dependable at the base of United's midfield as the man they are replacing has been for most of his eventful Old Trafford career.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",
      "Mainoo did not start a single Premier League match this season under Amorim but was selected at the first opportunity by new head coach Michael Carrick last weekend as he put in an impressive performance as United beat City 2-0 in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"It's a significant time.",
      "\"On the day Manchester United announce Casemiro will be leaving the club at the end of the season, the club want to tie down another, much younger player in Mainoo, who they see as a key player for the future.",
      "\"It's a significant change for Mainoo.",
      "\"Under previous coach Ruben Amorim, he didn't start a single game this season.",
      "\"There was also interest in him in Europe but Michael Carrick has come in and he starred in the win over Manchester City.",
      "\"Manchester United now feel that this is the right time, while they are putting their house in order, they want to tie down some of their younger players who are important to the club's future. Mainoo is at the heart of it.\"",
      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer, Manchester United have an interest in the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",
      "\"But especially with Casimiro, he is one of the highest earners at the club, and with that freed up wage space, we've been reporting in not just this window how Manchester United are targeting the summer to reinforce their midfield.",
      "\"We've already talked about the likes of Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, Carlos Baleba at Brighton, Elliot Anderson and Nottingham Forest, to name a few.",
      "\"And through INEOS taking really control of the football operations, they've tried to change the way structures are streamlined a lot more.",
      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",
      "\"They'll only have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, who looks like a new player under Michael Carrick, based on the Manchester derby.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes, now moving to No 10, they won't have many options in that position. INEOS will have to act quickly.\"",

      "🔴 Jesus over Gyokeres for Arsenal?💪 Miley's versatility for Newcastle🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres were seen to have given Mikel Arteta a selection dilemma against Manchester United in Arsenal's win over Inter Milan. But what if their goalscoring displays actually proved their suitability to their roles on the night?",
      "Arsenal looked a far more fluid attacking force with Jesus starting up front. The flurry of passes that led to their opening goal was untypical of Mikel Arteta's side this season and included a deft lay-off from Jesus to Mikel Merino before his instinctive finish.",
      "Jesus continued to knit things together, pulling to the flanks to combine with Arsenal's wide players, creating space for Eberechi Eze, feeding team-mates with his back to goal and, at one point, even driving forward with the ball and playing Bukayo Saka through.",
      "His performance, on only his third start this season, was reminiscent of the electrifying displays that followed his arrival from Manchester City in 2022, before the first in a succession of injuries struck.",
      "There was a set-piece goal too, of course, as he nodded his second over the line from a corner. But it was in open play that his impact was most apparent. Arsenal looked a different proposition thanks to their striker's imagination and technical security.",
      "They are qualities Gyokeres lacks. But by coming into the game as a substitute, when Inter were chasing an equaliser, he was able to show what he can do, attacking space on the break to latch onto Gabriel Martinelli's ball in behind before finishing superbly.",
      "It was a goal Jesus probably wouldn't have scored. Just as the opening goal by Jesus, with the intricate interplay that preceded it, was one Gyokeres probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "The first half of the season has exposed the limitations in Gyokeres's game. But it is also true that the conditions he found for his goal on Tuesday have rarely been available to him in the Premier League, where space is at a premium and compactness reigns.",
      "The moments when opponents become stretched tend to occur late in games, when they are tiring and, often, chasing goals. By that point, Gyokeres, who has started all but three of his 20 Premier League appearances so far, has usually been substituted.",
      "Arteta's hand has been forced, at least to some extent. Injuries to Jesus and Kai Havertz left Gyokeres as his only available striker for much of the season. But the option to change his role is there for the Arsenal manager now and the need for it is clear.",
      "Arsenal have won 13 out of 17 league games with Gyokeres starting but that is largely thanks to a reliance on set-pieces. They have only scored 13 open-play goals in those 17 games compared to 10 in the other five. There is a gap in open-play expected goals too.",
      "It is no coincidence that many of Arsenal's best and most fluent attacking performances this season, against Bayern Munich, Tottenham and now Inter Milan, have come when Arteta has started with either Mikel Merino or Jesus in the No 9 role over Gyokeres.",
      "Like Havertz, they bring more in the role. More touches, more passes, more duel-winning ability and, perhaps most damningly, more goals. Erling Haaland proves low-touch volume is not necessarily an issue for a striker. But only if that striker is scoring.",
      "Gyokeres, without a non-penalty Premier League goal since November 1, is simply not doing that. In his 17 starts up front in the competition, he has a worse shot conversion rate than any of the players with whom he is competing for the No 9 spot at Arsenal.",
      "All of which is not to say Gyokeres cannot be useful to Arteta. It might just require a recalibration of his role.",
      "At £64m, it is safe to assume he was not signed to be a substitute. But it is surely better to use him in the manner in which he can be most effective, as a relentless runner against tiring defences, than wait for him to become something he is not.",
      "Of course, the situation might look different had Havertz been available to share the minutes up front, instead of joining Jesus on the sidelines with a knee injury in August. A lighter workload, and more outings off the bench, might have suited Gyokeres better.",
      "It also would have made life easier for Arteta.",
      "Havertz's finishing has been a source of frustration to Arsenal supporters during his time at the club. But while the signing of Gyokeres was intended to add greater cutting edge, Havertz surely remains their first choice in the position when available.",
      "It is worth noting that at the time of the groin injury that curtailed his season last term, Havertz had scored 15 goals, putting him on track for the highest-scoring campaign of his club career.",
      "Across 31 Premier League starts as a forward for Arsenal overall, he has 24 goal involvements, with 15 goals and nine assists. And that is on top of everything else he brings to the role.",
      "They are hugely impressive numbers which underline the potential significance of a return to fitness which, frustratingly for Arsenal, is taking longer than expected. Havertz was an unused substitute against Nottingham Forest and Inter despite previously making cameos in the wins over Portsmouth and Chelsea.",
      "Jesus, of course, is still only recently returned from injury too.",
      "But if it is a choice between him or Gyokeres against Manchester United, events at the San Siro might have shown the way forward.",
      "The potential absence of Bruno Guimaraes against Aston Villa on Sunday following his injury against PSV Eindhoven is a worry for Newcastle. But in Lewis Miley they do at least have a player ready to step in and deliver whatever is asked of him.",
      "The 19-year-old ensured their captain was not missed in the second half of Wednesday's game. Having displayed maturity and composure in midfield, he ended up at right-back, taking the captain's armband off Kieran Trippier as he went off.",
      "It was a special moment for the academy product, who has been switching between positions all season. Having impressed as a makeshift right-back, he might now be needed back in midfield, where he has already slotted into a variety of different roles.",
      "Will Bryan Mbeumo be used as a No 9 again when Manchester United go to the Emirates Stadium on the back of their win in the Manchester derby? He can cause problems for the team against whom he made his United debut back in August.",
      "The last column made the case for Manchester United's new head coach Michael Carrick to go on the attack against Manchester City, something he did to great effect. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes's return to No 10 and Antoine Semenyo's impact.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "Enzo Le Fée has quietly slipped under the radar of wider footballing circles but not the eyes of Sunderland supporters.",
      "Le Fée's season pivoted the moment he was moved into a more central role. Freed from the touchline and given licence to operate between the lines, his influence has surged. He's dictating tempo, demanding the ball and, most importantly for this bet, shooting more. The numbers back it up.",
      "Le Fée has scored in his last two matches and across that run has hit four shots on target.",
      "At 5/4 with Sky Bet to hit one or more shots on target the market still hasn't caught up with his positional shift or his growing assertiveness in the final third.",
      "A 1-1 draw with Liverpool doesn't mask the bigger picture for Burnley, which is damning. Across all the key underlying metrics, Burnley sit rock-bottom in the Premier League. Expected goals for, expected goals against, shots conceded, box entries allowed - it's a clean sweep of concern.",
      "Spurs' ceiling is miles higher than Burnley's. When they click, they can overwhelm teams. Tuesday's win over Borussia Dortmund was a reminder of what this side can look like when intensity meets quality. Aggressive pressing, fast ball movement and a very solid structure in defence.",
      "Playing away from home hasn't been a negative for Spurs this season - quite the opposite. They've already gone to Manchester City, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Everton and come back with wins. The idea that Turf Moor is an impenetrable fortress doesn't stack up against this Spurs profile.",
      "The Evens for an away win looks generous.",
      "We can get very caught up in just picking a side in the prediction game. Home win or away win. But sometimes the smartest bet is the one nobody wants to back - and Fulham vs Brighton has draw written all over it.",
      "Just one point separates these two in the Premier League. Both teams are capable of beating good sides on their day, but neither consistently dominates teams of a similar level. When Fulham and Brighton face opponents in this bracket, games tend to settle into long spells of balance.",
      "The draw is the biggest price of the three outcomes and it's the bet nobody wants to back. Punters gravitate towards winners. Bookmakers know that. So, draw prices often drift organically beyond where the true probability sits, especially in evenly matched fixtures like this. It can be backed here at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is a fixture that automatically drags the goal line up. Manchester City at home, Wolves in town. The market instinctively leans towards a goal-heavy afternoon. But backing this Wolves defence under Rob Edwards has quietly become a profitable strategy. They're tighter, better organised, and far more disciplined without the ball. Over their last eight Premier League games, Wolves rank second best for expected goals against. That's elite defensive process.",
      "Then factor in Manchester City's week. Chaotic is the word. Distractions, noise, pressure and that often leads to pragmatism rather than expression. City don't need to win big here. Any win will do. Control, manage, move on.",
      "Yet, at 1/5 with Sky Bet they are a favourite worth swerving. Of those two win market options, I'd much rather back a Wolves win at 10/1.",
      "That opens up multiple paths for an under goals bet and it's the under 3.5 line at 4/5 with Sky Bet that stands out as the main play.",
      "Florian Wirtz's start to life in the Premier League has been a slow burn - but the signs are starting to show that we must start paying attention to him across the prop markets.",
      "The early weeks after his £116m summer move from Leverkusen were awkward. New league, new tempo, new expectations. All that jazz.",
      "Wirtz's end product has caught fire recently though. He's now averaging close to a goal involvement every 102 minutes across his last eight appearances in all competitions.",
      "After failing to score in his first 22 Liverpool appearances, he's now hit the net in four of his last seven. That's a player finding rhythm, timing and trust in his surroundings.",
      "He is 8/1 to open the scoring with Sky Bet.",
      "Some bets don't need overcomplicating. You look at the venue, you look at the numbers and the picture becomes clear. Brentford at home is one of those situations and the 10/11 with Sky Bet against Nottingham Forest is very hard to turn down.",
      "The Gtech has quietly become one of the toughest places to go in the Premier League. Brentford have taken 24 points from a possible 33 at home, the fourth-best home record in the division. That's not built on soft fixtures either, it's a repeatable edge driven by structure, intensity and crowd energy.",
      "Brentford are aggressive in duels, strong in second balls and ruthless in moments that matter. They turn games into uncomfortable experiences for visiting teams.",
      "Oliver Glasner's impending departure at the end of the season matters. Even the most professional squads feel it when leadership has an expiry date. Messages lose a fraction of their bite. It doesn't mean Palace will down tools but it does mean focus can blur at the margins and at this level fine margins decide Premier League games.",
      "Chelsea, fresh from their own off-field shake-up, arrive with something Palace lack right now: clarity. No looming exits. No major distractions. Just points to chase and a clear objective under Liam Rosenior to finish in the Champions League places. In matches like this, that mental clarity is an underrated edge and does make Chelsea an interesting betting proposal at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Joelinton and emotional control have always lived on opposite sides of the street. He plays on the edge because Newcastle need him to. Intensity, duels, aggression - it's his job description. And against Aston Villa, that edge has repeatedly tipped into yellow card territory.",
      "Joelinton has been booked in five of the last seven meetings between Newcastle and Villa. That's not a coincidence. Villa bring the kind of technical ball carriers and intelligent movers that force Joelinton into recovery challenges, late tackles and tactical fouls.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins are card magnets. Since the start of last season, that trio have collectively drawn 48 cards from opposition players. They're clever with their movement, sharp on the turn and excellent at inviting contact in dangerous areas.",
      "The 9/4 with Sky Bet for Joelinton to be carded is a serious runner.",
      "Bukayo Saka's current run of 12 games without a goal in all competitions is his joint-longest drought for Arsenal. From a surface view, that type of run would put people off selecting him in the goalscorer markets. But I see it differently. Trends in football always snap. And timing is everything when it comes to snapping them for profit.",
      "Saka is still Arsenal's creative heartbeat, the outlet for danger and the player most likely to exploit half-chances in the final third. Arsenal are likely to control large portions of this game and Saka will be central to creating or finishing chances.",
      "From a betting standpoint, the question isn't whether Saka will score eventually - it's when. This looks the time to jump on at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin facing Everton for the first time in his career is a classic \"ex-factor\" scenario. A player with motivation, familiarity and unfinished business - all variables that can't be factored into his goalscorer prices. Add in his current form and this becomes a very juicy angle for punters. Calvert-Lewin has been in electric mood. Eight goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances underline his finishing sharpness and consistency.",
      "He's leading the line for a Leeds team that have netted 17 goals in their last nine Premier League games - second only to Manchester City (18), which paints a picture of a confident team. You can get 2/1 on Calvert-Lewin finding the net.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 18:29, UK",
      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season upon the expiry of his current deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The announcement of his departure brings an end to a four-year stay at Old Trafford, which has seen him score in a League Cup final victory in 2023 and reach two FA Cup finals, winning the competition in 2024.",
      "Casemiro was also part of the United side that reached the Europa League final in May of last season.",

      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" Casemiro said in a statement.",

Casemiro was all over the place and his legs had gone - as had his confidence.",
      "There was a feeling that the midfielder United had splashed £70m on in 2022 was no longer fit for purpose. Now, as he approaches his Old Trafford swansong, he leaves with his reputation fully intact.",
      "Some eyebrows were raised when a 30-year-old five-time Champions League winner traded the Spanish capital for a spot in Erik ten Hag's Manchester United.",
      "However, a stellar first season that saw United finish third was some justification as a 'quick fix' appeared a stroke of real genius. Naturally on the wane, tougher seasons and poorer performances would follow but his importance would remain a fixture.",
      "Leaning on his experience, Ruben Amorim grew to rely on Casemiro in midfield after initially opting against fielding the veteran. Important goals like the one that helped United end a six-year trophy drought in the form of a Carabao Cup continued as Casemiro would prove clutch across various periods.",
      "Now Michael Carrick, a world-class midfielder himself during his playing career, has also recognised his importance as Casemiro started and impressed in his derby-day bow at Old Trafford.",
      "Success is relative, especially in regards to what Manchester United are now compared to the Real Madrid side Casemiro left. However, like Raphael Varane before him who made the same switch, Casemiro's significance in a side battling through transition will be a point in his career he looks back on fondly.",

      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club were in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",

      "The Red Devils were once regarded as the blueprint for commercial success in football and have topped the Money League in 10 of its 29 editions, most recently in 2017.",
      "However, United are down in eighth in the 2026 table, in part due to broadcast revenue dropping from €258m [£216.72m] to €206m [£172.9m] because of their absence from the Champions League in 2024-25.",
      "The club are set to generate even less matchday revenue in the current season due to their total absence from European competition, and their failure to go past the first hurdle in either domestic cup means they will play only 20 competitive fixtures at Old Trafford in 2025-26.",
      "\"The clubs with the biggest football club brands and position in the market have an opportunity to broaden their reach and offer more to fans on a matchday, offer more to fans on a non-matchday, and become a more 365-days-a-year touch point,\" said Tim Bridge, the Sports Business Group Leader at Deloitte. \"United are probably only just starting that journey now, because of the reported stadium development.",
      "\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader. If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.",
      "\"The opportunity remains for Manchester United. They are arguably still the biggest global football club brand, and therefore they have the opportunity to maximise that in a way that is only possible for a select few.",
      "\"But to do that requires fit-for-purpose facilities. As the industry evolves, clubs should ask themselves whether there is a need to rethink how they engage with fans and how that relationship works. With reports of the new stadium, it is clear they have started to do some of that, so it's very clear they're thinking in that way. Their timing of making that change is behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the opportunity remains.\"",
      "United are the fourth-placed English club in the 2026 Money League behind Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Real Madrid top as they became the first team to record revenue over €1bn - €1.161bn or £975.2m.",
      "Liverpool sit fifth after their return to the Champions League in 2024-25 and a seven per cent increase in commercial revenue from non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "It is the first time there has not been an English team in the Money League top four, with Real, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain all benefiting from going deep in the newly expanded Champions League and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "Deloitte said that the Club World Cup had resulted in a 17 per cent average uplift in broadcast revenues for the 10 Money League clubs who had been involved.",
      "Premier League teams may expect to fare better generally in the 2027 Money League, which will be the first to reflect the new broadcast deal which runs to 2029, but Bridge said the best-performing clubs would continue to be those who match on-field success with diversification off it.",
      "\"The trick to staying [in the top five] is maintaining both of those. It used to be you only had to maintain one of them. Now, in 2026, we're at a point where the highest revenue generating clubs are probably broader than football,\" he said.",

      "\"While growth has developed significantly in women's football in recent years, the shift from the start up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment, and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner,\" said Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "\"As further milestones are hit, including new and expanded competitions on the biggest stages, industry leaders must continue to innovate, while also protecting the wants and needs of fans and players to foster a more sustainable future for the game.\"",
