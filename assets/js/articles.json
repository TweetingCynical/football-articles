      "Bryan Mbeumo lastyear revealed his wish to play in the '\"biggest competitions\" for \"the best clubs\" amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham. The Brentford star looks set to make a switch this summer on the back of a 20-goal Premier League campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed his most prolific campaign to date under Thomas Frank this season, having arrived in west London from French side Troyes six years ago for a then-club record fee of £5.8million. Fast forward to this transfer window, and he's the subject of bids exceeding £55m from both the Red Devils and Spurs.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked all set to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo earlier this month, with reports suggesting he had 'prioritised' a move to Old Trafford, and personal terms would be no issue. However, his former boss Frank's move from the west of the capital to the north threw a spanner in United's works.",
      "The Danish head coach has replaced Europa League-winning boss Ange Postecoglou at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and it seems he wishes to bring Mbeumo along with him.",
      "Spurs have now risen to the ascendency in securing Mbeumo's signature, tabling a £70m bid, £15m more than the £55m figure United had rejected, and reports suggest that the player is now 'more open' to staying in London. Comments made by the 25-year-old last May also give Frank's new side the edge.",
      "Interest from top sides in Mbeumo can be traced back to the summer of 2024, when, after a campaign that saw him muster a respectable nine league goals, Liverpool and Newcastle came sniffing.",
      "Mbeumo issued a response to rumours linking him with the Premier League's finest, and told L'Equipe: \"I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs. It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me.\"",
      "The winger ultimately stayed put at the Gtech Community Stadium last summer. However, his comments regarding playing in the biggest and best competitions arguably throw weight behind Tottenham's bid in the current battle for his signature.",
      "While Amorim's United will be without European football next term, having finished the season in a lowly 15th, Spurs will grace the Champions League.",
      "They bested the Red Devils 1-0 in the Europa League final, ending a 17-year wait for silverware and qualifying them for UEFA's elite club competition. Yet, while Mbeumo clarified that playing in a tournament like the Champions League is an aim, he added the caveat that he would like to do so for the 'best clubs.'",
      "Not only did United finish slightly higher than Spurs in the Premier League this season, but they are also historically superior, having lifted a joint record 20 top-flight league titles, among countless other accolades that Tottenham have not.",
      "Mbeumo himself has dropped few hints as to which side he would prefer, though a post on Instagram when it was announced that head coach Frank would be departing made for telling viewing.",
      "The 25-year-old uploaded pictures of himself and Frank, captioned only with two prayer emojis, perhaps alluding to a desire to reunite, or maybe just wishing his former boss good luck.",
      "Either way, it seems the pull of Champions League football and the prospect of playing under the coach who mentored him into stardom could give Tottenham the advantage in this bidding war, though United still cannot be ruled out.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Legendary Manchester United gaffer Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed his deep-seated fascination with John F. Kennedy, going back to the time of the president's earth-shattering assassination in 1963.",
      "During JFK's presidency, a youthful Fergie was only in his early 20s, making a living playing part-time for St Johnstone and toiling away at his local shipyard.",
      "Despite being worlds apart from Kennedy's White House, Sir Alex felt a palpable connection to the US's youngest elected leader. \"I was fascinated with JFK when he was president,\" Ferguson told Insider.",
      "\"People don't maybe recognise the era he lived in, because he had to deal with the Cold War, Vietnam, racism, Medicare, the rail strikes, and Cuba.\" He added, \"You know, it was an amazing challenge for a young president.\"",
      "Amid various international tensions like the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK's innovative approach won him widespread admiration until his untimely assassination.",
      "Fascinated by one of history's pivotal moments, Ferguson admits the tragedy resonated deeply with him, reports the Daily Star.",
      "He reflected in his 2013 autobiography: \"The killing of John Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 left its mark on me from the day I heard the news. Over time I developed a forensic interest in how he was killed, by whom and why.",
      "\"For a young lad like me, Kennedy captured the imagination. He was a good looking boy and there was a certain spark about him.\"",
      "The legendary Manchester United manager credits JFK's influence as part of his inspiration that led to unprecedented success at Old Trafford.",
      "Sir Alex also shared a special connection with ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown through their mutual fascination with Kennedy. \"I've got about seven books by my bed. I'm into history (books) mainly. Gordon Brown sent me 35 CDs on the American Civil War, it was brilliant.",
      "\"I got a letter from a lad who ran the JFK committee and he used to send me a lot of stuff and he sent me the autopsy report. I've actually got a brand new copy of the Warren Report (the official investigation into JFK's assassination) signed by (former President) Gerald Ford, its the only one of its kind.",
      "\"He was a young man who was kind of in my era. I was involved in the trade unions and I was an ideologist about life. Kennedy presented a new vision of politics. Of course he had his critics but in his time as President I don't think any President in American history has been presented with as many problems and had to deal with it in a three year spell.\""

      "As his contract at Lille neared its end, Gomes was rumoured to be considering a return to the Premier League, with Tottenham, West Ham, Newcastle United and Liverpool all reportedly showing interest in the former United player.",

      "Bayer Leverkusen are weighing up a bid for Manchester City youngster James McAtee - who has previously been linked with Manchester United. Erik ten Hag is now in charge at the German outfit and will have to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "The playmaker is closing in on a £116million switch to Liverpool, which will leave the Bundesliga outfit with cash to spend and a sizeable void that needs filling. They have identified the City playmaker as an individual who could bolster their squad, reports Sky Germany.",
      "McAtee has enjoyed some impressive moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself under Pep Guardiola, who is known for taking his time when integrating young players into his system. The recent signings may also push him down the pecking order.",
      "He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League. One of those keen on McAtee are the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move however.",
      "As a result it could open the door for the club's former manager, Ten Hag, to swoop in with City likely to favour selling him abroad if they did have to part with the player.",
      "Guardiola admits he wants to keep the 22-year-old, but would understand his desire to play regularly. He said in April: “For the age, I’d like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don’t know how the squad will be and we will see.”",
      "City have seen Cole Palmer flourish since leaving the Etihad. He headed to Chelsea where he knew he'd play regularly and saw his career blossom - which may factor in McAtee's thinking. Conversely, Phil Foden's patience in Manchester was richly rewarded.",
      "Another factor at play is that McAtee’s contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The Manchester club have bought and sold well in recent years, meaning they have toed the PSR line well.",
      "McAtee may also see Leverkusen as an ideal destination given how the likes of Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham have excelled in Germany. The Bundesliga outfit can also offer Champions League football.",

      "Without doubt the biggest news in the last 24 hours is a report from Portuguese outlet Record, which claims Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres has turned down the chance to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The Swedish forward has been one of United's top targets since Amorim became the club's new head coach - after previously working with Gyokeres at Lisbon.",
      "United have watched the player underline his ability and reputation as one of the world's best strikers after netting 53 goals in all competitions",
      "But after the Red Devils missed out on Champions League football, it was always going to be an uphill battle for the club to attract Gyokeres, especially with rivals Arsenal also in the mix for his signature.",

      "It has been previously reported that Sporting have rejected a £55m bid for Gyokeres, which is said to have triggered anger from the striker, who said: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "Another blow for Amorim. The United head coach is eager to shift some of his deadwood - particularly Alejandro Garnacho after falling out with the player.",
      "But Sky in Germany are reporting that Bayer Leverkusen are now \"unlikely\" to make a bid for the Argentine due to the mounting \"package of transfer fee and wages\" being too high for the German club.",

      "A move to Leverkusen would see the winger reunite with former United boss Erik ten Hag, who has just taken over the Bundesliga side.",

      "One silver lining for United amid a string of set-backs. Some supporters might have forgotten they actually agreed a move for a young talent called Diego Leon from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno for around £7m.",
      "Left-back Leon has previously earned comparisons to Wayne Rooney given his similar impact at a young age and buzzcut hairstyle.",
      "United paid an initial £3.3m with add-ons for the 18-year-old's services but allowed him to stay with the club until the summer.",
      "The club will now welcome Leon to their camp at the start of July and his arrival should provide a boost to Amorim as a hungry, young player who wants to add competition and push for a place.",

      "Premier League clubs are facing the prospect of losing millions on big-money players they are struggling to sell as the ramifications of PSR start to bite.",
      "Seasoned England internationals including Marcus Rashford, Jack Grealish, Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are amongst those who have been told they are now surplus to requirements as teams look to raise transfer cash and save on superstar wages in a bid to keep the bean counters happy.",
      "But with many clubs now taking care not to overcommit financially in order to stay within PSR parameters, an increasing number of sellers must decide whether to slash asking prices or offer pay-offs to compensate for any drop in salary. In some cases they may have to do both.",
      "One top agent said: “This is the time of year when most transfer deals are done - and compromises are reached to help the market to move. We’ve already seen a number of big transfers take place at Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City - and they are likely to have a domino effect.",
      "“But a number of clubs have also made no secret of the fact that they’re looking to move players out who have cost them a fortune in transfer fees and wages. That’s a buyer’s market. Some clubs will have to cut their losses at some point just to get those players out of the door.",
      "“That means slashing valuations or subsidising salaries to move players out. Either way there’s going to be some pain. It’s not exactly a new scenario - but PSR has become an added complication. Clubs now count every pound. The wriggle room they once had is becoming tighter every year.”",
      "United made it clear at the end of the season that they were prepared to listen to offers for any player - but the priority is to find clubs for a group of misfits who cost more than £310million in transfer fees and who take home wages totalling a staggering £1.4million every week.",
      "That list includes Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, a quartet who were allowed to leave on loan last season, as well as Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, and Rasmus Hojlund. So far there have been no serious takers.",
      "Chelsea are facing a similar dilemma. The London club want to recoup cash on the £184m they invested on Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Ben Chilwell, Axel Disasi and Djordje Petrovic after leaving all five out of their squad for the Club World Cup.",
      "So far, the only concrete proposal has come for Felix from Benfica - but the Lisbon club want to hand Chelsea less than half of the £43m they paid Atletico Madrid last year and have indicated his £130,000-a-week wages are also excessive.",
      "Sterling, a £45m buy from City, has returned from a loan spell at Arsenal, while Chilwell spent last season at Crystal Palace four years after Chelsea paid Leicester £45m for the full-back. They earn £350,000-a-week and £200,000-a-week respectively.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s decision to leave Jack Grealish out of City’s squad for the CWC has confirmed that the £100m midfielder is now surplus to requirements at the Etihad. Everton would like to take Grealish on loan - if City subsidise his £300,000-a-week wages. The Blues also wouldn’t stand in the way of John Stones and Ilkay Gundogan, two players who take home more than £400,000-a-week between them in wages.",
      "Liverpool are prepared to cash in on £85m Darwin Nunez if they can recoup £70m for the Uruguayan striker - but he has made it clear that he would prefer to remain in Europe for a campaign that ends in the World Cup rather than to take up an offer from Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal that would tick most of the financial boxes at Anfield.",
      "Our source added: “Clubs from the Saudi Pro League could offer solutions but while the contracts on offer to players are fabulous, they are not always so generous when it comes to paying transfer fees. There is also the question of whether players want to play in Saudi when they’ve still got a lot to offer in the Premier League.”",

The 50-year-old, alongside his wife Victoria, has built an empire that extends far beyond the pitch, with their combined net worth estimated at £500million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List.",

Bolkiah, a 27-year-old winger who, at one point, was in Chelsea's academy, is a member of the Brunei royal family, owing his immense wealth primarily to his lineage as the nephew of the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah.",
      "Unlike Beckham, whose wealth stems from a storied career with Manchester United, Real Madrid, as well as countless lucrative endorsements, Bolkiah's fortune is mostly inherited. The Brunei royal family's vast holdings include oil and gas reserves, luxury properties, and investments that dwarf the earnings of even the most successful athletes.",
      "While Bolkiah's football career has earned him modest wages, his royal status places him in a financial league of his own. In contrast, the Beckhams have meticulously crafted their wealth through football, fashion, and media ventures.",
      "David's playing career, which included 115 caps for England and multiple league titles, laid the foundation. His post-retirement endeavours, including co-owning Inter Miami and securing high-profile sponsorships with brands like Adidas and Haig Club, have significantly boosted their fortune.",
      "Victoria's fashion empire, particularly her eponymous label, has added further millions, with the couple's business acumen evident in their £70m in company assets and £40m in dividends over recent years.",
      "Bolkiah, however, operates in a different realm. His wealth allows for a lifestyle that includes private jets and supercars, making the Beckhams' collection of Bentleys and Range Rovers seem modest by comparison.",
      "While David and Victoria's property empire - which includes a Notting Hill townhouse, a mansion in the Cotswolds and a Miami penthouse - is enviable, Bolkiah's access to palatial residences across Brunei and beyond is unparalleled. Yet, despite his riches, Bolkiah remains relatively low-profile in football, focusing on his career in Thailand and with the Brunei national team rather than chasing global stardom.",
      "He currently plays for Ratchaburi, having joined them from fellow Thai League 1 outfit Chonburi in 2023. Prior to that, he was contracted to Portuguese club Maritimo, but failed to make a senior appearance for the team.",
      "Bolkiah spent the bulk of his youth career in England, firstly with Southampton, then Chelsea and later Leicester. However, he wasn't able to earn a professional contract - despite being an international footballer (he's earned six caps for Brunei) since 2016.",
      "The contrast between Bolkiah and Beckham highlights different paths to wealth in football. While David represent the pinnacle of self-made success, leveraging talent and branding to amass a fortune, Bolkiah embodies a rare intersection of sport and inherited wealth, where football is a passion rather than a financial necessity.",
      "As Sir David basks in the glow of his knighthood, his and Victoria's £500m empire, though impressive, is a mere fraction of Bolkiah's billions, underscoring the extraordinary scale of the Brunei prince's wealth."

      "Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford's dazzling Cameroonian forward, has become one of the most talked-about names of the summer as the transfer window gathers momentum. The 25-year-old has enjoyed a breakout Premier League campaign - showcasing a potent mix of creativity, clinical finishing and tireless energy that's cemented his status as one of the division's standout performers outside the traditional 'big six.'",
      "Since arriving from Troyes in 2019, Mbeumo has been a quietly consistent presence for the Bees. But in 2024/25, he's shifted gears - racking up an impressive 20 goals and nine assists across 42 appearances. With numbers like those, it was only a matter of time before top clubs came calling. Now, they are.",
      "With Manchester United and Tottenham locked in a fierce tug-of-war for his signature, speculation over his future is reaching fever pitch. Mbeumo offers both clubs a unique mix of flair and versatility, but where will he end up?",
      "The Red Devils thought they had Mbeumo in the bag. Reports suggested the Cameroon international was keen on a move to Old Trafford, and with Matheus Cunha already secured, United felt they had the luxury of time to finalise the rest of their summer business - or so they thought.",
      "Their opening bid of £50m (£40m plus £10m in add-ons) was promptly rejected by Brentford. A few days later, United returned with an improved offer of £55m (£45m plus £10m in add-ons), but the Bees remained firm, valuing their star man closer to £70m.",
      "While United hesitated, Tottenham seized their chance. They swooped in with a superior offer - reportedly £65m plus £5m in add-ons - and instantly changed the complexion of the race. Their ace in the hole? Newly appointed manager Frank, who helped nurture Mbeumo into a Premier League gem in West London.",
      "That existing relationship could prove decisive, and now, what once looked like a straightforward deal for United is teetering. Tottenham have emerged as serious rivals for his signature - and suddenly, it's they who look to have the momentum in the situation.",
      "Just days ago, Mbeumo seemed destined for United. It's understood he'd 'given priority' to the Manchester club, reportedly over other English suitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle. The Red Devils' project, despite no European football next season, appealed to Mbeumo, who was sold not only on Ruben Amorim's vision after talks in May, but also by the prospect of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "Despite their rejected bids, United were expected to strike an agreement with Brentford sooner or later. But Frank's arrival at Tottenham has flipped the script. Reports indicate that while Mbeumo's first choice remains United, he's increasingly leaning toward a move to Spurs, swayed by the chance to reunite with the manager who knows him best.",
      "Tottenham's willingness to meet Brentford's valuation, coupled with Frank's promise of a starring role in their Champions League campaign, has Mbeumo rethinking his future. While United aren't out of the race yet, Spurs' aggressive push has put them in a commanding position, leaving fans on both sides chewing their nails.",
      "Amid the transfer whirlwind, Mbeumo has stayed tight-lipped - until now. The Brentford star recently took to Instagram to address the elephant in the room: Frank's departure to Tottenham.",
      "After the move was confirmed, he uploaded a post with multiple photos of him and Frank together, captioning it with two prayer emojis. The post, while dripping with gratitude, sent fans into a frenzy, with many reading it as a subtle nod to his hopes of a potential Spurs switch.",
      "However, Mbeumo's social media activity doesn't explicitly commit to any club, keeping the saga deliciously open-ended.",
      "If Mbeumo's online signals are enigmatic, his impact on the pitch is anything but. It's no surprise, then, that both United and Tottenham are pushing hard - ready to splash significant cash to secure Mbeumo's signature.",
      "Where things begin to diverge, however, is on the wage front. United are reportedly prepared to offer a package worth around £160,000 per week. Tottenham, on the other hand, are offering closer to £130,000 per week - still substantial, but a figure that would push the upper limits of their current wage structure.",
      "As negotiations intensify, the forward's next destination remains one of the summer's most captivating subplots. Whether it's under the bright lights of Old Trafford or alongside familiar faces in North London, one thing is clear: wherever Mbeumo lands, he has every chance of becoming a major success.",
      "A player in his prime, with momentum at his back and suitors at his feet, ready to light up an elite stage. The only question left is: who gets to call him theirs?"

      "David Beckham's Inter Miami are all set to host the FIFA Club World Cup opener with frontman Lionel Messi, but the side's inclusion in the tournament initially sparked backlash. The MLS franchise were selected as one of the 32 participating teams in October last year.",
      "The revamped Club World Cup selects top sides from across the globe to do battle over a month-long competition in the United States, and it will kick off with perennial Egyptian champions Al Ahly facing Beckham's outfit in front of an anticipated 62,000-strong Miami crowd.",
      "Inter Miami were named Supporters' Shield winners last year after amassing an MLS record 74 regular-season points. However, this did not mean they were crowned MLS champions.",
      "The accolade they claimed is a trophy given to the side with the best regular-season record. While the Florida-based club then progressed into the MLS play-offs, they lost in the first round to Atlanta United.",
      "Nonetheless, their place at the Club World Cup was confirmed by FIFA president Gianni Infantino under rather controversial circumstances, as the selection criteria had not been laid out at the time, and eventual MLS champions, LA Galaxy, would eventually be omitted.",
      "Co-owner Beckham once plied his trade in Los Angeles, and it was on the back of this move that, 11 years ago, the ball got rolling on the Manchester United icon investing in an MLS expansion franchise.",
      "Inter Miami began playing in 2020, and three years later, they secured the groundbreaking signing of global superstar Messi from PSG. Their purpose-built Freedom Park stadium is set to open in 2026.",
      "The marketability and pull of stars like Messi and some of his team-mates, including Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, are why many were quick to criticise FIFA's decision to hastily include Inter Miami as the host team of the Club World Cup, as they accused FIFA of favoritism.",
      "Speaking in October at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale after Inter Miami had beaten New England Revolution, president Infantino confirmed the club's qualification, and admitted: \"Miami loves football, the world loves football, and the world loves Miami. So I have three things to tell you.",
      "\"The first, many congratulations for winning the Supporters' Shield. And on top, with the record of points in Major League Soccer. Congratulations, you are the best team of the season in America.",
      "\"Second, based on this outstanding performance of this year you deserve to be, and you will be, for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,\" he revealed.",

      "Chelsea and Manchester City will join Inter Miami at the Club World Cup. The English pair qualified for the competition after winning the UEFA Champions League in 2021 and 2023, respectively.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side begin their campaign on Monday against Los Angeles FC, and the Cityzens face an unknown entity in the form of 2022 CAF Champions League winners Wydad AC, or WAC Casablanca, on Wednesday.

      "It was by far his best season since arriving at the club in 2019 after taking his total goal tally to 70 in 242 appearances. Now he is being tipped for a move to a big club and Manchester United have already had a bid of around £60million rejected by Brentford.",
      "But with his former boss Frank joining Tottenham, the north London side have now entered the race and Mbeumo is said to be \"intrigued\" over a move to Spurs - who have launched a bid of around £70m.",

      "\"I've said many times: we are a selling club. But at the same time, we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world that aren't selling clubs.",
      "\"So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it. But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Mbeumo is still leaning towards Manchester United, but Spurs have received \"encouragement\" that the player could be interested now that Frank has become their new manager.",
      "There is a feeling that Mbeumo has \"earned the chance\" to join a bigger side this summer - so long as a club meets their valuation of £70m for a player who was only outscored by Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland last season.",

      "It was a daunting career step to swap Brazil for Sion but for Cunha, this was the right move at the right time. It turned him from South American prospect into a performer on the European stage and set him on a path that this month saw him join Manchester United.",
      "That raw 18-year-old taking his first steps in Europe dreamt of perhaps one day calling Old Trafford home. It's his house now.",
      "At Sion, he studied French - the native language - and within a few months had picked up the lingo. He made a similarly fast start on the pitch.",
      "Ten goals in 24 league games meant his spell in Switzerland was limited to a sole season before RB Leipzig came calling.",
      "His career has continued on its upward trajectory, thanks in no small part to that 12-month learning curve in a small south west corner of Switzerland.",
      "And it was his mentality and personality that shone through.",
      "\"When you move from Brazil to Sion, you have to have character,\" said Christian Zermatten, who coached Cunha in Switzerland.",
      "\"The first months he spoke Spanish but he tried hard in school and worked very hard to learn French,\" he added. \"After a bit of time the language was no problem for him! And he had the international language of football.",
      "\"After four or five months his family came, when you come from Brazil it is better if you can come with family. But we had two or three Brazilians at the club. Two players and an assistant coach and after three or four months they were a little family of Brazilians.",
      "\"I remember the first game I told the President to play with eight players and then put the three Brazilians as strikers and let them play and be free. He expressed himself on the field.",

      "He's a natural fit for one of the No.10 positions in United's system, his talent on the ball and his ability to progress the play are characteristics Amorim wants to see. And they were evident a decade ago when a young Cunha was making his way in the game.",
      "\"He was a player with lots of speed and a good technique with the ball, he was a quick dribbler,\" Zermatten added. \"He knew very well the game, he had good vision. He was intelligent. He could change position. Now it is 10 years on but he always wanted to win.\"",

      "For all the winger's obvious talent, disciplinary issues have threatened to derail his time at the club on a number of occasions. That threat has now become a reality.",
      "Perhaps the biggest shame in all of this is that Ruben Amorim and Garnacho tried to make it work. After Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad in December, the latter didn't make another appearance for United and was soon shipped out on loan to Aston Villa. Garnacho went the opposite way, playing a part in every game after the derby victory bar the final day win over Villa.",
      "Despite being asked to play out of position as a No.10, Garnacho looked to be an indispensable member of Amroim's squad. The inconsistency and occasional lack of composure in front of goal that's to be expected from a 20-year-old remained, but Garnacho and Amorim looked set to enjoy a strong working relationship. Until it all went pear-shaped.",

      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have been crossed by Garnacho, and while allowances should be made for one so young, there comes a point where you have to draw a line in the sand and decide it's best for both parties to go their separate ways.",
      "Nobody saw Garnacho's exit coming, should indeed the club receive an acceptable offer for the youngster, but it might be for the best."

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

Joshua Zirkzee represented the only attacking arrival, yet his haul of 13 goals in two years in Serie A hardly suggested he would be the answer to United's goalscoring woes.",
      "Did they really expect things to get any better? If they did then they'll have been very disappointed.",
      "Things only got worse in the 2024/25 season, with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee - the club's two senior centre forwards - managing just seven league goals between them. United scored 13 goals fewer last season than they managed in 2023/24, recording a -10 goal difference as they finished 15th in the table, having looked set to finish just one place above the relegation zone at one point.",

      "And then there's the big question of who will lead the line next season.",

      "During an interview with Viaplay back in May, Thomas Frank was quizzed on Bryan Mbeumo's future. As quoted by the Evening Standard, the former Brentford boss said: \"It's clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount.",
      "\"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. \"hen it's clear that it's impossible to replace him one-for-one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for.",
      "\"I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club?",

      "It feels a long time ago that the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United began with a bang at Portman Road.",
      "Barley two minutes in and Marcus Rashford had scored for the Reds at Ipswich and prompted plenty to wonder whether he might prove the striker beneficiary in the central role in Amorim's set-up.",
      "Within a matter of months, Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa and he has no future at United. The decision to cast him aside is ultimately one for Amorim and it will likely still provoke debate while United continue to struggle in front of goal.",
      "His expected departure would also see the end of a two-decade association for Rashford at United, having first joined the club aged seven.",
      "The Reds have almost always had young English talent in their side and more often than not those players are local lads who have come through the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "Sometimes the talent comes from further afield but a look down some of the greatest players in the club's rich history includes plenty schooled in the ways of United and born and raised in the city.",
      "Yet just now that path is, if not empty, certainly sparse. United didn't have a single player in the last England squad and they don't have a representative in the England Under-21 squad currently competing in the European Championships.",
      "And two prospective transfers this summer could see the prospective numbers drop further. United are keen to move Rashford on this summer. His fellow academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo could follow.",
      "The midfielder was an England regular 12 months ago, playing in the European Championships having ended a breakthrough campaign at United with a goal in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "But little over a year on, a combination of injury, form and Ruben Amorim's seeming uncertainty in knowing exactly where Mainoo should play, has led to him dropping down the pecking order.",
      "United's need to sell players to fund a squad overhaul also places Mainoo at risk, given as an academy graduate he would represent pure profit for the football accountants. There is no certainty the midfielder is sold this summer, but neither is there a guarantee he remains. And the fact that contract talks have stalled on a new deal only muddies the waters further.",
      "If Mainoo does depart, then United will not only lose a talented young footballer, they'll lose another part of their identity.",
      "Rashford and Mainoo represent the pathway at United, from growing up in the city to growing into first team regulars. If both departed that baton would fall to Tyler Fredricson, who made his first senior appearances last season but is still in the early stages of his development.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Harry Amass and Toby Collyer have all made the breakthrough into the first team as young English players but all arrived at United late on in their junior development.",
      "Mason Mount, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are the senior English professionals at the club while Tom Heaton came through the United ranks before making his way in the game elsewhere prior to rejoining in the autumn of his career.",
      "Part of United's make-up is the local boys done good. The Reds have plenty of promise in their academy and a recent trend for recruiting talented teenagers from at home and abroad shows that promoting and investing in youth remains a part of the modus operandi, but it's home where the heart is. United have to make sure they don't lose theirs."

      "Leon plays as a left-wing-back and he will, of course, have to force his way past Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass in the pecking order.",
      "It is more likely he will play with the under-21s to begin with but Amorim has shown he is not afraid to throw in youngsters when they are ready, handing debuts to teenagers Amass, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven this season.",

      "For all the poor decisions and mismanagement at Manchester United, perhaps one of the club's biggest problems is something they can do very little about.",
      "Countless players have arrived at Old Trafford and been swallowed up by the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. And when said players ultimately leave United and thrive elsewhere, little consideration is given to the fact their upturn in form may well be down to the reduced pressure levels at clubs where the spotlight isn't quite so intense.",
      "Of course, United might not be able to do anything about the pressure that comes with representing the club, but they can ensure the players they sign are ready to cope with the demands that come with pulling on that famous red shirt.",
      "In Matheus Cunha, they have signed a player who is all too used to being under the spotlight.",
      "While Wolves may not be the biggest team in England, two-and-a-half years spent in the Premier League after a stint in La Liga with Atletico Madrid along with 15 caps for Brazil mean he is ready for what's about to come his way.",
      "\"I'm so free for that (the pressure that comes with playing for United), honestly. I think I'm grateful to be part of the biggest national team in the world, the pressure there is also huge,\" he told MUTV. \"And I learned a lot. I learned a lot, I think in the beginning it was a little bit different in parts for me.",
      "\"To be honest, sometimes I don't think I managed well and I think I learned from the mistakes. I don't think it's mistakes, it's normal, it's learning. To come here now is the best moment in my life to also feel open for these kind of details.\"",
      "The final part of that answer is also telling. One of the reservations some fans have had over Cunha is his disciplinary record. He was suspended for a combined six matches last season following a full-time scuffle with an Ipswich Town security guard and a red card at Bournemouth. He admits he's learnt a lot in his career so far and is ready for the challenge.",
      "At 26, Cunha is coming into his prime and his 15 Premier League goals last season suggest United have got themselves a real quality player.",
      "With experience of playing in the Premier League, experience of playing in some of Europe's other top leagues and a relatively modest fee of £62.5m for a player who should fit seamlessly into Ruben Amorim's system, it really does feel like the only thing that could get in Cunha's way is the pressure of playing for United.",
      "He wouldn't be the first player to crumble but he's confident that he won't."

      "Delap enjoyed a very encouraging first season in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals in a poor Ipswich Town team.",

However, without any real competition, the shot-stopper kept his place in the first-team. If United want to find themselves at the top end of the table, they need to rectify their goalkeeping struggles and the arrival of a Premier League-proven goalkeeper like Martinez would go a long way.

United have already missed out on Liam Delap and the reports surrounding their latest disappointment will only add pressure to their hunt to fire attacking reinforcements. Ekitike is said to be courting interest from around Europe already and the Premier League with Frankfurt wanting around £85m for a player with his prime years ahead of him he could be a good piece of business. However, United have been found guilty of overspending in the past which has come back to haunt them."

      "Manchester United have reportedly decided on their transfer alternative to Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, who has his heart set on a move to Arsenal.",
      "The Swedish forward believes he needs to join a club competing in the Champions League next season and vying for the Premier League title.",
      "United insiders have declined to comment on Portuguese reports suggesting the 27 year-old has expressed disinterest in reuniting with his ex-Sporting coach Ruben Amorim in Manchester, reports the Mirror.",
      "However, it is believed that the Reds have already begun scouting for alternative targets - and are prepared to intensify their pursuit of Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Ekitike, a 22 year-old France Under-21 international, has also caught Liverpool's eye after netting 22 goals for the German side last season.",
      "However, Frankfurt's £80 million asking price for the former Paris St Germain forward would need to be significantly reduced before United make an offer.",
      "United have already been told that they will have to come up with an acceptable offer for Frankfurt, with the club's sporting director Markus Krosche telling Wiesbadener Kurier: \"If the price isn't right, then he'll simply stay with us. We don't have to sell Hugo.\"",
      "As for Gyokeres, the transfer saga around the Sweden striker has taken many twists and turns this week. On Thursday he took to the social media platform Instagram to break his silence on mounting speculation on his future, saying: \"There is a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false.",
      "\"I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "His comments came after Sporting president Frederico Varandas gave his understanding of the situation around a supposed 'gentleman's agreement' for the player to leave for around £60m instead of his £84m release clause.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" Varandas said. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\""

      "Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is on the verge of a return to professional football, after almost two years without a competitive appearance. The France international was initially handed a four-year ban, reduced to 18 months upon appeal, after he was provisionally suspended following a positive drug test.",
      "The 32-year-old mutually terminated his Juventus contract in November, and he's been free to return to the pitch since March, where he has been building up his fitness ahead of a prospective move. Pogba has faced numerous links over a free transfer including Turkey, Brazil and a move to the MLS, as well as a possible move back to France with Marseille.",
      "However, according to fresh reports, Pogba has been offered a two-year deal at AS Monaco - which will see him return to his native France and make his bow in their national division after breaking through at Old Trafford.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported that negotiations and discussions on the project will continue this weekend in a bid to try to reach an agreement which would see the World Cup winner feature for Adi Hutter's side.",
      "In an interview with Ball.LDN, Pogba pinpointed his aspirations to win one more major honour after talking up the quality of Didier Deschamps' France national team.",
      "\"The French team are exciting and I'm a big fan of them already,\" he said.",
      "\"I can't wait to see how they further develop and win a future World Cup - hopefully with me as a teammate.\"",
      "The next edition of the grandest prize in international football will be held across three countries with Canada, Mexico and the United States hosting the competition, in 2026. The possible move to Monaco poses as an opportunity for Pogba to fire his way back into the contention of the national team after last playing for them in March 2022.",
      "He is just nine matches away from reaching a century of appearances for the national team, with France facing six more matches in their bid for World Cup qualification, starting at the beginning of September before bringing their campaign to a close at Azerbaijan in mid-November."

      "The summer transfer window is set to re-open on Monday after a six-day break and Manchester United are going to hope to wrap up some more business.",
      "United confirmed the arrival of Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal from Wolves earlier this month, but the Reds have been quiet since then, despite Bryan Mbeumo confirming he prioritises a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is still keen for United to sign a No.9 - with Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike among those linked with a move this summer.",
      "Elsewhere, United want to get players off the books, with Alejandro Garnacho expected to leave the club. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are set to follow him out of the door.",
      "Off the back of reports on Friday morning that Mbeumo is intrigued by the prospect of signing for Tottenham, it appears that Spurs have forced United's hand.",
      "According to The Mirror, Spurs have launched a £70million bid to sign the Brentford player this summer - and that's £15million more than United's opening offer. It is claimed that United remains the preferred destination for Mbeumo but this big bid could take the matter out of his hands.",
      "Mbeumo has worked with Frank at Brentford for six years now and he has aided his development from a Ligue 2 footballer to consistent performer in the Premier League. In fact, the 25-year-old produced his best-ever season in 2024/2025, finding the net 20 times in 42 matches.",
      "And the fact that Frank has been appointed Tottenham's new head coach may just convince Mbeumo to team-up with him at the Europa League winners.",
      "Sporting CP have offered United target Gyokeres the assurance that he will be allowed to depart this summer, for £51million plus add-ons, according to his agent Hasan Cetinkaya.",
      "Frederico Vandaras, Sporting president, claimed in a press conference on Wednesday that there is no gentleman's agreement for Gyokeres to leave the club in a package worth £59million.",
      "However, Cetinkaya bit back on Friday and revealed he has written evidence of the agreement that he made with Sporting, and that the Sweden international can leave for £51million and £8.5million in bonuses.",
      "Now, Cetinkaya has confirmed Sporting have guaranteed that Gyokeres can leave for the agreed sum this summer, with United, Arsenal and Juventus among those interested.",
      "It's clear that United need to sign a new No.9 and Gyokeres would be my pick, purely because of the fee and the fact that Amorim has worked with the ex-Coventry City player before. Plus, he has proven that he can score on a frequent basis over the last couple of years - something that United could do with."

      "Ex-Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has been appointed as the new Plymouth Argyle head coach.",
      "The 35-year-old, who retired from professional football in July 2023 as a result of injuries, stepped into coaching at Watford before he was appointed as their head coach in March 2024. However, Cleverley was sacked in May after guiding them to a 14th-place finish. Watford were, at one point, in play-off contention but faded during the second half of the season.",
      "Since, Cleverley has been out of work and searching for his next managerial role. Now, Plymouth have decided to appoint the ex-United man after Miron Muslic's departure.",
      "Despite committing his long-term future to Plymouth at the start of last month, Muslic then opted to leave after receiving an offer from 2. Bundesliga side Schalke. Plymouth have acted fast to source Cleverley as a replacement, with the former Everton man signing a three-year contract at Home Park.",
      "Chairman Simon Hallett cut a delighted figure after confirming the appointment of Cleverley. He told the club's website: \"Ever since Miron's departure - and knowing Tom was available - we identified him straightaway as the perfect person to be our next head coach and targeted him immediately.",
      "\"When we spoke with him he was completely aligned with the vision and ambitions of the club and it was clear throughout that Tom was the right fit for us. He is fully invested in our long-term plans and will play a key role in helping us achieve them.",
      "\"He is young, passionate and did a great job at Watford.",
      "\"We are thrilled to bring him to Argyle and look forward to seeing the impact he has on the talented squad at his disposal.\"",
      "Argyle CEO Andrew Parkinson said: \"We were inundated with interest from prospective candidates, which shows how exciting this project is. But, throughout the process, it was clear that Tom was the perfect person to take the club forward.",
      "He's been highly sought after, so we are really pleased we have been able to bring him to Argyle and look forward to seeing him build a squad and style of play that will see us challenging at the top end of League One this season.\"",
      "Cleverley becomes Plymouth's first head coach within the space of 18 months, with the merry-go-round starting when Steven Schumacher left to join Stoke City in December 2023. Ian Foster was appointed in January 2024 but lasted just 14 matches - with then-director of football Neil Dewsnip and first-team coach Kevin Nancekivell taking over and keeping Argyle in the Championship.",
      "Wayne Rooney, a former teammate of Cleverley's for United and England, then became Argyle's head coach last summer, but was sacked on New Year's Eve after a difficult start to the campaign.",
      "Muslic was brought in to replace Rooney but, although there were some impressive results and performances, he couldn't prevent Plymouth from relegation back to League One."

According to reports in Germany, the Old Trafford giants have now entered the race to sign the French youngster following a superb season at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "United are scouring the market for the latest face to inject quality into a department which struggled for goals last term. Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund managed just seven goals between them in the Premier League as Ruben Amorim's side registered one of the worst-ever domestic finishes in their history.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already entered the fray after his £62.5million release clause was triggered - signing on a five-year deal - while United have expressed an interest in Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "But the latest reports surrounding Ekitike pose a new possible target in the transfer window which re-opens, once again, on Monday, June 16.",
      "BILD's Eintracht Frankfurt reporter Johannes Wolf has previously described Ekitike as one of the best strikers on the market this summer, ahead of Gyokeres and Arsenal-linked Benjamin Sesko, only behind Newcastle United talisman Alexander Isak.",
      "\"They did it with the Randal Kolo Muani transfer and no one expected them to go so hard on PSG until the last second, I think that helps them now,\" he said.",

      "\"Marmoush went to €82m to Man City, when he was 22 - just like Ekitike is now - he was playing in the second division in Germany.",
      "\"Now, Ekitike has great numbers with Frankfurt in almost every competition.",
      "\"It's a high fee, but it's not completely unreasonable, especially when you look at the potential - especially with what's available.",
      "\"If you ask me, he's the biggest prize after Isak on the market this year, I see him as better than [Benjamin] Sesko, some people have question marks over [Viktor] Gyokeres, so I can see why Frankfurt ask for a fee of €100m.\""

After a quiet couple of weeks, talks have since resumed under the same circumstances, with a salary of £10.2million per year and a fee of £63.7m including bonuses for Napoli.",

Osimhen had been targeted as a marquee signing for Al-Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup and a £63million deal had been agreed between the Saudi Pro League side and Napoli.",

      "Speaking about his future in February, Osimhen said: \"I don't know [about the future], to be honest. A few months ago, nobody ever thought I would come to Galatasaray, despite how big of a club they are.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United have been ‘offered a swap deal’ to offload £86m flop Antony to Serie A giants Juventus.",
      "25-year-old Antony never came close to living up to expectations after joining the Red Devils for around £86m from Eredivisie giants Ajax in 2022.",
      "Man Utd massively overpaid to sign the Brazil international, who followed Erik ten Hag in joining the Premier League giants from Ajax.",
      "At the time, it was widely reported that the Dutch head coach had lobbied for this transfer, but a recent report claims he actually ‘wanted to stop’ this deal from happening.",
      "Antony barely featured for United at the start of this campaign and joined Real Betis on loan during the winter transfer window.",
      "The winger benefited from this fresh start as he regained his confidence, grabbing nine goals and five assists for the La Liga outfit.",
      "READ: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "Real Betis have the option to sign him permanently, but it has been suggested that they are struggling to meet the financial demands of Man Utd and Antony as elite European clubs show interest.",
      "In January, Man Utd would have struggled to attract bids worth around £20m for Antony, but his value has shot up in recent months and it appears he has plenty of options.",
      "Despite returning to form, Antony’s future still lies away from Old Trafford as they hope his exit could raise funds with upgrades required in most positions.",
      "Bayern Munich have been sporadically linked with Antony in recent months, but Romano claims Juventus have also made a move to sign him.",
      "Romano has informed GiveMeSport that the Serie A giants ‘offered’ former Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz in a ‘swap deal’ for Antony a ‘few weeks agio’ as they felt it would be a ‘smart move’ to sign the Man Utd outcast following his recent resurgence.",
      "Aston Villa cashed in on Luiz during the 2024 summer transfer window as they looked to avoid a breach of the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "Luiz was one of Villa’s best players during the 2023/24 campaign, but he has struggled to settle at Juventus and has been heavily linked with a return to the Premier League in recent months.",
      "Romano claims Juventus ‘wanted’ Antony and ‘explored a move’, but the recent exit of sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has changed their plans.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Antony is appreciated in Italy and Juventus were prepared to discuss different formulas for this deal to happen, eventually also on a double loan with buy option clauses. Why did it collapse? Because Juventus director Giuntoli left the club a few days ago in a reshape decided by the ownership with new director Damien Comolli now taking care of the operations.",
      "‘The discussion for Antony and Douglas Luiz, at the moment, is not even advancing anymore. Let’s see later in the window if this story can change, but Juventus really considered Antony – now it is up to the new directors.’",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Man Utd have received a boost in the transfer market with Real Betis preparing a deal that would be get Antony off their books for at least another season.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are at risk of being hijacked in the race to sign Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres after a ‘direct call’.",
      "Former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag was ignored by the Red Devils hierarchy as he attempted to stop them buying Antony, according to his agent.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid ...",
      "Jadon Sancho could replace Antony at Real Betis this summer as Man Utd set their price for the Brazilian, according to reports."

      "The cheeky little early transfer window door creaked shut but the transfer window proper is set to open on Monday as we split our focus between Premier League comings and goings, and the inaugural all-new Club World Cup.",

      "That haul came despite Mora starting just 16 Liga Portugal games for Porto, largely in the left-sided attacking midfield role in a 3-4-3 formation that’s become infamous at Old Trafford since Amorim took charge.",
      "The Red Devils could do a lot worse than Mora as they scour the market for alternatives to top target Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham, but will have to pay a similar fee for the 18-year-old, with Porto inserting a €70m [£59m] release clause into his new contract.",
      "",
      "Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nLiverpool are reportedly considering Ramos as a fall-back option should they fail to land any of their top targets – we’ve ranked ten of them – and PSG have also ‘offered’ him to United for £50m, which can’t have felt good for a striker with a more than reasonable goalscoring record for the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "And we wonder whether United should climb down from a high horse which has seen them make a failed attempt for Viktor Gyokeres ahead of various other doomed bids for elite strikers and consider a move for a guy whose 32 goals for PSG have come at a rate of one every 109 minutes when they’re current leading No.9 has scored 26 at a significantly reduced lick of one every 246 minutes.",

      "Randal Kolo Muani (Juventus)\n“I’m very happy at Juventus, I hope to continue there,” Kolo Muani said. “They welcomed me well, and I’m enjoying it.”",
      "Juventus are also thought to be keen on retaining the France international’s services after his eight Serie A goals for them since his January move, but it remains to be seen whether they can meet PSG’s demands. They wanted €75m [£64m] for his permanent transfer in January but that asking price is now thought to have dropped to around £42m as the Champions League winners look to cash in.",

      "Here’s hoping a path from Benjamin Sesko, past Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and the other top strikers on Andrea Berta’s wishlist leads to a man they used to really want but now absolutely don’t.",

      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\n“Let’s see how things develop in the future,” said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl after revealing the “very, very respectful” talks with Chelsea over a move for Gittens before the CWC came to nothing.",
      "“We have different ideas about the player’s current value,” Kehl explained, in the process revealing that the Bundesliga club are at least open to his sale for the right price.",
      "They may well see the tournament as an opportunity to bring more clubs to a bidding war party for the Englishman, while Noni Madueke – who looked set to be the big loser had the deal been reached – should be looking at the CWC as a way to prove Chelsea don’t need to add further competition for his spot on the wing as Estevao will be hoping to impress through his displays for Palmeiras ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "Oscar Gloukh (RB Salzburg)\nGloukh’s performances at the European U19 Championships in 2022, including a stunning goal against England in the final, alerted the world to his potential. Interest from Barcelona was eschewed in favour of a move to Red Bull Salzburg, but he has since been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and, most recently, Aston Villa.",
      "“It makes more sense for my development,” Gloukh said when asked to explain why he opted for RB Salzburg, aware as we all now are that the Austrian club is one of the best springboards to bigger and better things in Europe.",

      "Inter have already been credited with interest in Delgado, who describes himself as a dynamic, tactically minded player, who loves to steal the ball from the opposition, which sounds like precisely what Manchester United hoped they were signing in Manuel Ugarte and explains why they too have been linked with the teenager with Ugarte failing to meet that expectation.",

      "The 21-year-old went to Porto instead and has enhanced his reputation with 25 goals in all competitions.

      "A number of big clubs are on the lookout for a new No.1 and there are some very good goalkeepers available – to varying degrees – this summer.",
      "Here are 10 top stoppers we think might be gettable…",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nDonnarumma’s agent will have you believe the Italy keeper is available because he needs more leverage on contract talks with PSG, who want to keep their current custodian, but not at any cost.",
      "Of course, Manchester United’s name has been mentioned because that’s the oldest trick in the agents’ book, but Donnarumma himself said his priority is to renew with PSG. But only if he gets paid.",
      "",
      "9) Nick Pope (Newcastle)\nEddie Howe clearly isn’t entirely convinced by Pope given he’s trying again to sign James Trafford from Burnley. Newcastle want us to believe that Trafford would be arriving to compete for the No.1 position, but the new boy is not likely to make that move at this point in his career without a certain level of assurance. Which suggests Pope’s days as first choice are numbered; there would be considerable interest from other Premier League clubs in need of an experienced England international.",
      "",
      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester)\nThe 25-year-old keeper was one of very few to emerge with a smidgen of credit from a miserable season at the King Power. At least the Dane had ample opportunity to show what he can do – only Ipswich and Southampton allowed more shots on their goal.",
      "Before demonstrating that he could stay at the highest level while Leicester return to the Championship, Hermansen played a big role in the Foxes’ promotion to the Premier League. Brentford were linked before they found a bargain in Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "",
      "7) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton)\nRamsdale’s move to Southampton last summer made you wonder if the England keeper actually enjoys being relegated. Were there really no other better offers? Perhaps not, given the daft sod once openly admitted to struggling with concentration, but when his mind is on the job, Ramsdale remains a very good keeper. West Ham were sniffing and he feels like a good fit for Leeds.",
      "💷 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever: Chelsea shamed but Arsenal evolution clear",
      "",
      "6) Marcin Bulka (Nice)\nThe Nice no.1 has told the French club he fancies a move this summer, which they will be keen to facilitate since the Pole has only a year remaining on a contract he almost certainly won’t renew.",
      "The 6ft 6in giant, who began his career at Chelsea and went via PSG to Nice, has been catching eyes across Europe, and obviously Manchester United have been linked. But the Red Devils will have to wait until January since UEFA banned them doing any business with INEOS stable mate Nice until after this summer window.",
      "",
      "5) Vanja Milinkovic-Savic (Torino)\nThe Serbian stopper began his career as a youth player at Manchester United and he has been linked with a move to Old Trafford – maybe we should just assume that to be the case for all these keepers unless stated – after three solid seasons in Torino’s sticks. AC Milan, though, seem to be the frontrunners, with an agreement in place to pay the 28-year-old’s £17million release clause if they lose Mike Maignan.",
      "Only two keepers in Europe’s top five leagues performed better in relation to their expected goals against than Milinkovic-Savic, who conceded 11.4 goals fewer than the algorithms expected him to.",
      "",
      "4) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nWidely proclaimed as the best goalkeeper in the world but, more accurately in our view, he was the goalkeeper for the best team in the world. Argentina, that is, not Villa. That doesn’t mean he isn’t very, very good, and he would be an asset to any team looking for a stopper this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been linked, and he’d certainly be an upgrade, but Villa don’t have to give him away, even if they are the club in most PSR peril.",
      "",
      "3) Lucas Chevalier (Lille)\nIf Villa sell Martinez, then Chevalier is said to be high on their list of potential replacements. Though that plan could be scuppered by PSG if they can’t reach an agreement with Donnarumma and sell the Italy keeper to a club more willing to meet his massive wage demands.",
      "At 23, Chevalier conceded 7.3 goals fewer than xG suggests he should last season, with Manchester City said to be keen on the France call-up.",
      "",
      "2) Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid)\nIt seems Lunin is open to exploring his options away from Real’s bench because we have to assume he’s given up on ever replacing Thibaut Courtois as No.1. The penny should have dropped when Courtous returned from injury for the 2024 Champions League final when Lunin had played most of the season.",
      "Apparently, Real are open to selling the Ukraine stopper for £20m-25million, with the 26-year-old said to be on the radar of a host of top clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Mike Maignan (AC Milan)\nThe France No.1 is a year from the end of his contract and seemingly intent on leaving AC Milan after growing tired of the lack of progress in negotiations over a new deal. All of which presented a great opportunity for Chelsea to upgrade their goalkeeping option, none of which Enzo Maresca is happy with, but the Blues refused to take their opportunity.",
      "Milan apparently want around £21million but Chelsea were prepared to go no higher than £12million. Chelsea blew a clear run at Maignan, which should alert a number of big clubs. But here is the one keeper Manchester United haven’t been linked with, when they really should be.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘in talks’ over signing Burnley star James Trafford but they face competition from rivals Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have missed out on a key transfer target before the Club World Cup, with Fabrizio Romano confirming a deal is ‘off’.",
      "The ‘exceptional’ Club World Cup transfer window closes at 7pm on Tuesday, with a series of eye-catching possible signings including some Liverpool sales.",
      "Chelsea are expected to return with an improved bid for Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens after reaching a contract agreement, according to reports.",
      "If Chelsea secure the bargain signing of an AC Milan star, it could reportedly ‘spell doom’ for two of their players, with an ‘immediate exit’ suggested.",
      "It’s now a ‘matter of time’ before Man Utd sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan to replace Andre Onana, according to reports."

      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",
      "",
      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nAs far back as August 2017, Sancho has been on the Manchester United radar. Borussia Dortmund’s ability to grant the ambitious young forward a clear first-team pathway meant they secured the Manchester City academy talent but his immediate burst onto the Bundesliga scene only crystallised interest from back home.",
      "For each of the subsequent years until he finally arrived at Old Trafford in 2021, Sancho was frequently linked to a club hoping to build around a youthful British core; Manchester United even ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the England forward 12 months before he actually moved.",
      "But Sancho has been nothing close to the wait. Even during his “freedom” from 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for Manchester United, Chelsea paid £5m to specifically not sign him permanently.",
      "This place will belong to Florian Wirtz soon enough.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Manchester United (x3), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1), Liverpool (x1)",
      "Total cost: £962.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.

Have Arsenal made an offer? Two offers? Are Manchester United in the running? We’ve attempted to unpick fact from fiction…",

He now wants to leave. Arsenal and Manchester United are interested. He has a €100m [£84m] release clause in his contract.",

      "But that door to Arsenal looks to be ajar at best with Fabrizio Romano claiming RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘clear favourite’.",
      "Pinches of salt are therefore required over reports claiming the Gunners have made one bid of ‘around €55m’ as a fixed fee for Gyokeres plus bonuses which could take the transfer up to €65m (again, not enough) and that they are preparing a second bid that will ‘exceed €70m’ in total.",
      "And it’s no wonder Sporting want to ramp up the asking price if, as A BOLA claim, Cetinkaya is due 10 per cent of any rejected proposal which exceeds €60m thanks to a particularly cunning ‘sales mandate’ the agent ensured was part of his contract.",
      "We assume that clause can only be triggered once, and not for every rejected proposal over that amount, but the report suggests if the agent does decide to take up the option (and why wouldn’t he?) then ‘Sporting will demand the full value of the player’s termination clause, that is, the €100 million euros’.",

      "The German’s price of £116m will make him the record arrival into British football but what of the current top 10?",
      "Here’s a look at the most expensive players in Premier League history and whether they sank or swam at their new clubs.",
      "10. Josko Gvardiol – £78 million\nThe £77m paid out by Manchester City for Josko Gvardiol made him the second most expensive defender in the world but already the Croatian has gone some way to proving he was worth the money.",
      "In a season of underwhelming performances, Gvardiol was a rare bright spark and was even playing out of position at left back.",
      "He featured in all but one league game, scoring five goals in that time, and has emerged as one of the best defenders in the league.",
      "City look to be in the market for a left-back, meaning Gvardiol should be able to move into his more comfortable centre-half position next season.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "9. Harry Maguire – £80 million\nIn United’s ‘banter era’, Maguire has become the unwitting face but look beyond the memes and the defender has been a rare consistent performer at Old Trafford.",
      "Joining in 2019, he has made 247 appearances for the club and as managers have come and gone, he still remained in the side.",
      "Maguire was at his best in the tail end of United’s 2024-25 campaign and even if it ended in a Europa League final defeat and 15th-place finish, Maguire was one of the few to come away with his reputation not broken beyond repair.",
      "Was he worth the £80m United stumped up? Probably not but there are plenty of worse signings in this list.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "8. Antony – £86 million\nSpeaking of…",
      "Manchester United’s signing of Antony has turned out so poorly that almost everyone involved is trying to claim it was not their idea.",
      "After a good but not spectacular season at Ajax in 2021-22, United opted to fork out up to £86m for the Brazilian but the wheels soon began to fall off.",
      "It started promisingly with a goal against Arsenal in his debut but his scoring soon dried up. The Brazilian ended his first year with eight goals in 44 appearances.",
      "Forever remembered for a roulette spin that went nowhere, Antony scored just one league goal in his second season at Old Trafford and after making only eight appearances in the 2024-25 Premier League season, he was shipped out on loan to Real Betis.",
      "It was in Spain where Antony recovered his form, earning a nomination for La Liga Player of the Month and helping Betis reach the Conference League final as he became the latest United player to flourish away from Old Trafford.",
      "His Betis performances were a small consolation for United who may be able to claw back some of his transfer fee but regardless of where he goes, the Old Trafford side are certain for a big loss.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "7. Mykhailo Mudryk – £89 million\nIf the logic behind United’s move for Antony seems shaky, the thought process Chelsea followed to sign Mudryk now seems outright absurd.",
      "After the war in Ukraine suspended football in the region, Mudryk made played 19 times in the 2021-22 season but his performances convinced Chelsea to part with £89m to bring him to Stamford Bridge in a move that represents peak Boehly transfer strategy.",
      "Since then, Mudryk has struggled to break into the team, playing 15 league games in his first season without scoring. He did at least play 41 times in the 2023-24 campaign, ending it with just 11 goal involvements.",
      "As a result, Chelsea looked to strengthen in that position, pushing Mudryk to the bench before he was hit with a provisional suspension for failing a doping test. But even as he waits for the result of the second test, Chelsea’s view on him was made clear when they gave his number 10 shirt to Cole Palmer.",
      "The good news for Chelsea is there are only another six years on his contract to go.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "6. Paul Pogba – £89million\n#Pogback did not turn into the homecoming that either player or club was expecting.",
      "Paul Pogba’s unveiling as a United player in a video backed by Stromzy seems a fever dream now and the Frenchman became the biggest figure of frustration during the Mourinho era.",
      "Aside from pushing Graeme Souness to an early grave, Pogba’s very brief moments of brilliance only made his time at Old Trafford even more exasperating as for every game he was good in, he would spend 10 as a passenger.",
      "Eventually, United cut their losses – allowing his contract to expire and Pogba moved back to Juventus again.",
      "In February 2024, Pogab was hit with a four-year ban for doping but it was reduced on appeal. Now able to play again, the Frenchman has been unable to find a club as of yet.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "5. Romelu Lukaku – £97million\nIf the other names on this list disappointed on the pitch, at least they did not take to the media to openly criticise the club and beg for a move away.",
      "Lukaku returned to Chelsea in 2021 on the back of an incredible season with Inter but the Belgian soon found himself a square peg in a round hole given Thomas Tuchel’s system.",
      "He went nuclear in his response, taking to the media in December to criticise Tuchel before saying he wanted to return to Inter “in the near future.” He was unsurprisingly dropped from the squad as a result.",
      "Peace talks between him and the now-England manager were held, culminating in a public apology from the player but a few months later and he was sent back out on loan to Inter.",
      "The following season, he stayed in Italy this time with Roma before joining Napoli permanently in 2024.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "4. Jack Grealish – £100million\nBefore heading to the Etihad, Grealish was one of the most reactive and expressive players in the league but he would not be the first, or last, to find himself just a part of Pep Guardiola’s system.",
      "The Catalan manager tends to leave new signings to it in their early days, meaning Grealish’s numbers were quite good, but as more was asked of him, the former Villa player’s performances took a nose dive.",
      "A great season in the Treble-winning campaign was followed by a stop-start season in 2023-24 and he ended the year with just six goal involvements in 36 games.",
      "Last season he was relegated to the bench, playing just 715 minutes in the league and now looking destined for the exit door.",
      "Summing up his City career then is a difficult task as he was a big part of the Treble success but has been limited since then and you don’t pay £100m for a bit-part player.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "3. Declan Rice – £105million\nIt seems odd to call someone who cost more than £100m a bargain but Rice is looking increasingly like that.",
      "Already a talent at West Ham, Rice has improved to be one of the best midfielders in the world and when the likes of Martin Odegaard have gone missing, he has stepped up to the big occasion.",
      "A duo of stunning free-kicks saw Arsenal ease past Real Madrid in the Champions League – the highlight of their season – and you get the feeling that if the Gunners are to break their league title drought, Rice will be key to that.",

      "2. Enzo Fernandez – £106.8million\nIf Rice has been money well spent, Chelsea’s version has yet to fully justify his price tag.",
      "Coming off a World Cup win, the fee Chelsea were going to have to pay Benfica was always going to be high but £106.8m looked particularly costly.",

      "The report says new Spurs boss Frank is keen to bring Mbeumo to north London after working with the forward at Brentford since 2019 and that the club have ‘launched a £70m bid to hijack United’s move’.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy views Mbeumo as a statement signing for Frank’s first summer in charge following Ange Postecoglou’s departure.",
      "United, however, remain the forward’s preferred destination despite Tottenham’s higher bid and promise of Champions League football.",

      "2) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",

      "1) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will cost more on his own."

      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was the subject of a bid by Manchester United; he is intrigued by a move to Spurs now that Thomas Frank is head coach; the forward is valued in excess of £60m by Brentford and they are willing to listen to offers",
      "By Lyall Thomas and Michael Bridge",
      "Saturday 14 June 2025 08:57, UK",
      "Tottenham have held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Bryan Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach.",
      "Spurs are interested in Mbeumo and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Having appointed Frank as head coach on Thursday, Spurs have received encouragement about a potential deal for Mbeumo, who was the Danish coach's star man at Brentford.",
      "Manchester United are also interested in Mbeumo, and had a bid rejected for him before Spurs started talks to hire Frank. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation, which is in excess of £60m.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Friday 13 June 2025 12:16, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Monday 9 June 2025 18:40, UK",
      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Manchester United also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward despite having a bid rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo - a player also on the list at Spurs.",
      "Mbeumo appears to be United's priority target after a £55m offer was rejected by Brentford last week - and they are expected to follow up with another offer.",
      "There have been reports that Thomas Frank wants Spurs to sign Mbeumo if he becomes their new head coach - but it is ultimately Spurs as a club that decide who they sign.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Johan Lange call the recruitment shots, with the returning Fabio Paratici also having a say - so a Frank arrival would not necessarily make a move for Mbeumo inevitable.",
      "He is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It means both Semenyo and Mbeumo's futures remain in the balance as Frank nears the head coach role at Tottenham - an event that may prove pivotal in the outcome for both men.",
      "Tottenham have opened talks with Brentford for Thomas Frank.",
      "Discussions between the clubs over compensation are under way. Spurs have no second or third-choice options. Frank is and has been the No 1 target for board members.",
      "Frank is interested in taking the job and wants to speak to Spurs. Although Brentford do not wish to stand in his way if he wants to move to a bigger club, they do not plan to let him go on the cheap.",
      "Brentford are prepared to listen to offers from Spurs but expect them to be serious ones.",
      "Frank has a release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run. It is widely being reported to be in the region of £10m.",
