      "As Manchester United enter the final few days of the transfer window, Ruben Amorim is still waiting for a first victory of the new season. An opening weekend defeat against Arsenal was followed by a draw at Fulham on Sunday, with captain Bruno Fernandes missing from the penalty spot.",
      "New signing Benjamin Sesko is still waiting for his first start, having come off the bench in both league matches. However, fellow summer arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo both started against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Next up for United is a League Cup trip to Grimsby, followed by a home league game against Burnley. Amorim will be targeting victories in both games to kick-start the season, while the three attackers to move to Old Trafford this summer will all be aiming to get among the goals.",
      "One area where investment may be needed is in goal. Altay Bayindir hasn't wholly convinced during the first two games of the season, and progress appears to be being made over Sanne Lammens.",
      "Scott McTominay has attempted to convince Rasmus Hojlund to join Napoli, according to reports in Italy. The latest indication from Corriere dello Sport is that McTominay's talks have been successful and Hojlund is now close to making the switch.",
      "The Danish international striker enjoyed a steady first start at Old Trafford but struggled in front of goal last season. He has yet to feature this term, in part due to Sesko's arrival, with Napoli and AC Milan both keen.",
      "Napoli have money to spend after selling Victor Osimhen to Galatasaray in July. If he heads to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Hojlund would find himself linking up with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne following the Belgian's early summer switch.",
      "Jadon Sancho has not said no to Roma, according to the Italian club's manager Gian Piero Gasperini. Reports earlier in the window suggested Sancho had no plans to join the Giallorossi, but this appears far from certain.",
      "“Sancho never said no to Roma,” Gasperini told Italian broadcaster RAI (via Football Italia). However, the Italian side still have work to do if the winger is to join.",
      "Bayern Munich have also been linked with a move for Sancho, though reports from Germany over the weekend suggested that move doesn't look likely. Bayern started their Bundesliga campaign with a 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, with wide men Michael Olise and Luis Diaz among the scorers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is open to the idea of leaving Manchester United this summer, according to talkSPORT. The midfielder broke into United's first team under Erik ten Hag but has found action harder to come by with Ruben Amorim at the helm.",
      "The 20-year-old was an unused substitute for United's first two games of the season, with Casemiro partnering Bruno Fernandes in the middle. He also started on the bench in the final two league games of the 2024-25 season and was restricted to late cameos in the semis and final of the Europa League.",
      "Chelsea were previously linked with Mainoo, a product of United's academy. His current contract runs until 2027, but it has been suggested United would need a sizeable offer if they are going to cash in.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly closing in on a move to Napoli, with Manchester United set to take a huge loss on the striker. Hojlund joined United from Atalanta back in 2023 for a fee of around £72million.",
      "However, he has struggled to make much of an impact at Old Trafford, managing just 26 goals in 95 appearances across all competitions. United have strengthened their attack significantly this summer and Hojlund has been deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Hojlund has been left out of the squad for United's first two Premier League games this season, with the likes of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "The deal is worth a total of €45m (£39m), which would represent a huge £33m loss for the Red Devils. Napoli have been desperate to sign a new striker ever since Romelu Lukaku picked up a thigh injury in pre-season which is set keep him out of action for several months.",
      "Hojlund will be hoping he can find some form in Italy, having insisted during United's pre-season tour of the US that he wanted to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford. \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland ).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far.",
      "\"Just focusing on continuing that. Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready.",
      "\"I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Manchester United benefited from two incorrect refereeing decisions in their draw against Fulham on Sunday, according to ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey.",
      "United drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage in a game dominated by contentious decisions by the officials. The away side should have taken advantage of a penalty call in their favour, but Bruno Fernandes blazed his effort over the crossbar.",
      "Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after VAR sent him to the pitchside monitor to watch an incident from a corner. Fulham defender Calvin Bassey was adjudged to have fouled United midfielder Mason Mount by throwing him to the floor.",
      "Halsey believes that the VAR did not need to send Kavanagh to review the incident because there was a foul by a United player which cancelled things out. He also thinks that United got away with a foul when Leny Yoro’s header went in off Rodrigo Muniz to put them 1-0 up.",
      "“As well as Bassey on Mount, you must also look at Luke Shaw on Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz as both incidents happened simultaneously,” Halsey wrote for The Sun.",
      "“I do not know why he was called over. Even when Kavanagh went over to the screen, he was there for quite some time looking at it. There are two incidents, so which one is the more serious? The referee should have just played on. They cancel each other out.",
      "“You can understand why Marco Silva has gone ballistic because for United’s goal, you can see a clear push from Leny Yoro on Bassey. So why is that not disallowed?”",
      "Gary Lineker made a similar point when discussing the decision and how it is communicated to fans on the Rest is Football podcast. He said: \"They got a penalty, which my goodness, what a bizarre experience. You know, going to the game, we're watching the game, there's a corner and then the ball's cleared, the ball goes up to the other end of the pitch and Fulham's on the attack.",
      "\"Then suddenly the ref stops and you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Now, I know the experience is probably different at home, but if you're in the ground, Oh my. Then you look at, you see a sign saying VAR penalty check. And I was honestly sitting there and I said 'For which team, who to?'",
      "\"I didn't even know whether it was that end or that end, and you had no idea what was going on. I mean, it's such an awful experience for fans.\"",
      "United have taken just one point from their opening two Premier League games after Emile Smith Rowe cancelled out the Muniz own goal with a well-timed finish from a cross into the box.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has claimed Ruben Amorim \"has no excuses\" this season and admitted the team's poor start to the season is \"a worry\".",
      "United have started the season with a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal before drawing 1-1 away at Fulham as their wait for a first win goes on.",
      "The club have spent almost £200million on new signings this summer, with three high profile forwards arriving in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but the team still look far away from firing on all cylinders under Amorim.",
      "There was concern against Fulham after United failed to dominate the game and hurt Fulham, having also missed a penalty in the first half.",
      "Rooney is worried for his former club and believes Amorim is under pressure to pick up results \"quickly\" after a poor start, believing he won't get the same leniency he had last season.",
      "\"There’s no excuses now for the manager this season,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show. \"He’s got to start getting results and getting them quickly.",
      "\"Once you start getting into October or November, if results don’t change drastically that’s when the pressure comes. They needed to hit the ground running this season and one point from six is a bit of a worry.\"",
      "When asked if Amorim could be backed as a long-term manager for United, Rooney replied: \"It’s difficult to sit here and say ‘Yeah 100 per cent’. I don’t think anyone could do that.",
      "“I don’t think Ruben would probably say that himself with what we’ve seen since he’s been at the club. I think recruitment has been good in the summer – although I’d still like to see two or three more players. But it’s difficult to say this is going to be our manager for the next five years based on what we’ve seen.”",
      "Rooney said one of the biggest concerns was that old habits from last season were starting to appear in this campaign, adding: \"[Amorim] had the pre-season and brought players in, you’d like to have seen a bit more and see the players understand their roles a bit better. There’s a lot to be worked on.\"",
      "The ex-England striker played 559 times for United and scored 253 goals, winning five Premier League titles, four domestic trophies and two European cups.",

      "Manchester United are never far from full-blown crisis - and this season it has taken just two matches. After a summer that has seen them spend in excess of £200m, the Red Devils languish in 16th in the Premier League.",
      "They've got one point and scored just one goal and even that strike came off of Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz. It's certainly not been the start that anyone at United will have wanted.",
      "Of course, it's still early days. Only two games of the season have been played so there's plenty of time left for Ruben Amorim to turn the ship around.",
      "But United's current form follows a worrying trend under the Portuguese coach, having won just seven Premier League games since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been a poor start to the season for United, there's no getting around it. But there would be no reason to sack Amorim quite yet.",
      "His new signings are still getting bedded in and the transfer window remains open. And let's be fair to the Red Devils, they've not had the easiest starts to the season.",
      "They gave title contenders Arsenal a real run for their money - and could have claimed at least a point - while Fulham look an outside bet for a European spot so a draw away at Craven Cottage is not the end of the world. You also have to remember simply how bad United were last season.",
      "Amorim will not fix all of those issues overnight. He needs time. And that's exactly what he should be given by United chiefs. Let him get to at least November and then you can re-evaluate. If United are still struggling to string wins together then by all means pull the trigger but to even think of sacking him any time soon would be nonsensical.",
      "The fact that we’re talking about the future of a manager after two games of a new season tells you all you need to know about the extent to which Manchester United’s struggles get everyone talking. This isn’t anything like Graham Potter’s situation, with the West Ham boss under pressure after two games, two defeats and eight goals conceded - and even that has been deemed too early by some.",
      "United have lost narrowly to a title contender and drawn an away game which they might have won in other circumstances. The word crisis is only being thrown around because the bar for that term is lower for the 13-time Premier League winners than for any other club in this country.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked by United because things were patently getting worse, and there was a case for getting rid in May 2024. Last season’s Europa League run showed Amorim has found a path to improvement, and to throw that all away should take a lot more justification than what we have seen so far this term.",
      "United should certainly give Amorim more time, but the signs look ominous. In their next handful of fixtures they face a trip to Manchester City and a home clash against Chelsea and you do wonder how things are going to get better.",
      "The next games against Grimsby and Burnley have to be two easy wins. Anything less and there will be some serious feelings of unease inside the fanbase - and the board. Every manager needs time to implement his strategy and new signings need to gel. But you do look at his 3-4-3 system and wonder if it's the best fit for the players he's got. We're yet to see Mbeumo and Cunha being the dangerous attackers they were tipped to be at Old Trafford, while the midfield situation looks like a real issue.",
      "The facts don't lie. Amorim has won only seven times from 29 Premier League games. He's drawn seven and lost 15. It's a results business and if things are still looking bleak by October or November, United might have to just accept this isn't going to work out.",
      "With a full pre-season behind him, Ruben Amorim would have hoped for a faster start but there is no need to panic. Under Erik ten Hag, United actually lost their first two Premier League games of the 2022-23 season and went on to finish third, albeit a fair distance behind winners Manchester City and runners-up Arsenal.",
      "There have been promising spells during the defeat at home to the Gunners and the draw at Fulham and a tally of 32 attempts on goal suggests this is a team that will create more chances than it did last season.",
      "Converting more of those chances is clearly the main issue for Amorim to sort and not starting with Benjamin Sesko has been a bit of a head-scratcher, even if there are doubts about his match fitness.",
      "But a front three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will score plenty of goals when they get to know each other well. Sure, the opening couple of matches has shown there is still a host of problems that Amorim needs to solve but those problems were so deep-rooted that he will need a lot more time to re-establish United as a serious Premier League force.",
      "You'd have thought that the positive thing about appointing a manager who is wedded to one system and one system only would be that over time that system would become fine-tuned, and the players would almost know exactly where their team-mates are without a second thought.",
      "That might end up being the case for Ruben Amorim, but given the changes in United's attack this summer things have almost gone back to square one as new players learn the way, the only way, the manager wants them to play.",
      "Of those new players Matheus Cunha looks lively but he isn't prolific, Benjamin Sesko will take a while to get up to speed and I have my doubts that Bryan Mbeumo was the right addition to play in this formation as a right sided No.10.",
      "All of which means United are back at a point where results are in danger of getting away from them, just as they did for most of last season.",
      "Amorim's job shouldn't be under immediate pressure now, but things can quickly get out of control. Burnley at home on Saturday is huge for him, with Manchester City and Chelsea to come after the international break.",
      "Manchester United have to hold their nerve. They cannot press the panic button because this season has got the potential to be a game-changer for the club.",
      "The front line looks so exciting with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But in spending £206m on forwards, they have neglected other key areas: namely the keeper and a holding midfielder.",
      "But if they can do a deal for a keeper and get a better balance in midfield, I am still convinced they can have a decent season under Ruben Amorim.",
      "They better had - I’ve tipped them for top four! That is all based on that forward line because that front three is so exciting and is packed with goals.",
      "United have to improve elsewhere but they were never going to solve all their problems in one transfer window. And they still can’t and won’t.",
      "But we have seen enough, change and panic at Old Trafford to remind everyone they cannot do it again. They have to try and find a couple of solutions this week but either way this will be a better season for United despite the early bumps in the road.",
      "One point from two games isn't the rip-roaring start that Manchester United or their fans would have been seeking this season but it shouldn't be all doom and gloom. They were genuinely impressive - and unfortunate - in defeat against Arsenal and looked so much better going forward in patches against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "There's no getting away from the fact that Ruben Amorim's record in the Premier League has been poor since his arrival last November, but United have just committed more than £200million on a new-look attack. It would be insanity to hit the panic button anytime soon, particularly as other problem areas - namely the goalkeeper situation and midfield - are not issues of Amorim's making.",
      "The cold hard truth is that there is no magic fix for United after recording their worst-ever Premier League finish last season. There could be more pain before they turn a corner and Amorim's refusal to deviate from his favoured formation has split opinions.",
      "But he deserves a fair crack at turning things around that will take far long than just two transfer windows. I think there have been enough glimpses of promise in United's opening games to suggest that better times are coming.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has given a three-word reason for Benjamin Sesko’s early Manchester United struggles amid scathing criticism from Gary Neville. The £74million signing from RB Leipzig has come off the bench in United’s two Premier League games so far but made little impact, with Neville saying “he's nowhere near in terms of fitness.”",
      "Sesko is likely to make his first start for the club in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at League Two Grimsby Town, where he will be hoping to top up his match sharpness and open his account for the club.",
      "Head coach Amorim has naturally jumped to Sesko’s defence. Speaking after the 1-1 draw at Fulham, where the 22-year-old replaced Casemiro early in the second half as part of a tactical switch, Amorim said: “He needs time.”",
      "The head coach added: “It's not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "“Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him. Last week, I was saying, 'Look, let's just get him straight in.’ He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football. What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "“The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.”",
      "Asked why he kept Sesko on the bench for the second straight game, Amorim explained: “We tried to imagine what is going to happen during the game.",
      "“Our team needs to be consistent in the way that we control the game and we need to have options to play a different game on the bench. Sesko has had two weeks for us, he is trying to understand everything. We need to wait a little bit to help the player. We just want to win the game and try to help all of our players.”",

      "As the summer transfer window races towards its September 1 deadline, the next few days could be crucial for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Manchester United. Both wingers are at the centre of a complex web of negotiations, valuations and rival club strategies, with Chelsea playing a key role in how the saga plays out.",
      "The plot thickened when United turned down a bold proposal from Chelsea: a swap deal involving Garnacho and 19-year-old winger Tyrique George. For Garnacho, who has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, the move would have offered a new beginning at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Once touted as the next star of United's attack, Garnacho has become disenchanted with life under Amorim, who has shown little inclination to reselect the 21-year-old since their relationship soured. United, however, are not prepared to let him go on the cheap.",
      "They initially priced him at around £70m, while Chelsea have been pushing for a significantly lower fee of nearer to £30m, citing his strained relationship with Amorim as justification for a discount.",
      "United, though, have made their stance clear: if Chelsea were happy to shell out £55m for Jamie Gittens earlier this summer, then Garnacho - who has more Premier League experience - should command at least a similar price.",
      "This disagreement has brought talks to a standstill, with Chelsea reluctant to part with cash until they've finalised several key departures. While Garnacho has other suitors, he's got his sights set on Chelsea.",
      "For the Blues, Garnacho is just one piece of a larger puzzle. Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, and Tyrique George are all expected to leave before the transfer window slams shut, but their exits are still in the works.",
      "Whether Chelsea can generate funds and free up squad space could ultimately determine if either Garnacho or RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons - who has already agreed personal terms - end up in West London.",
      "Nkunku's situation is perhaps the most complex. Injuries have hampered him since his move to Chelsea, but his technical prowess continues to draw attention. Bayern Munich are interested, though they favour a loan deal, while Chelsea are adamant about a permanent sale.",
      "Aston Villa have also thrown their hat into the ring, with boss Unai Emery eager to inject some attacking diversity into his squad. A return to RB Leipzig is also a possibility, with Chelsea reportedly offering the Bundesliga side the chance to re-sign their former star as part of their bid to secure Simons.",
      "Jackson's future at Chelsea is also hanging in the balance. Despite a reasonably impressive goal record in England, the Senegalese forward has found himself pushed down the attacking pecking order following the arrival of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "Both Aston Villa and Newcastle are interested in Jackson, who is keen on a reunion with Emery, his former boss at Villarreal. However, Chelsea's hefty £70m price tag is proving to be a stumbling block, with potential buyers hoping for a reduction as the transfer deadline looms.",
      "Meanwhile, young talent George could be heading for an early exit from Stamford Bridge. With Pedro, Gittens, Estevao - and possibly Garnacho and Simons - joining the ranks, his chances of breaking into the first team are slimming.",
      "Initially, Chelsea intended to send George out on loan, but now a permanent move seems more likely. Roma have emerged as the favourites, eyeing him as their top winger target after missing out on Sancho.",
      "Sancho's transfer window has been fraught with disappointments and setbacks. United had reportedly struck a deal with Roma earlier this summer, but the England international turned down the Italian side's offer.",
      "This decision appears to have backfired. With Roma now focusing on George, Sancho is left scrambling for other options, while United are keen to offload the player, who spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea but failed to make a significant impact.",
      "Roma haven't completely dismissed the idea of reigniting their interest in Sancho, but their focus on George suggests that United's chances of offloading him are dwindling. Unless a late suitor comes into the picture, Sancho could find himself stuck in a rut at Old Trafford once again.",
      "Chelsea's ambitions stretch far beyond Garnacho and Simons, but the success of their plans depends on shifting players out. If deals for Nkunku, Jackson and George come to fruition, the Blues will have the funds and squad flexibility to make a strong push.",
      "If not, Garnacho might have to stay put - at least until January. It could even force Chelsea into a situation where they have to choose between Simons or Garnacho.",
      "For United, the situation is equally precarious. Garnacho remains a valuable asset that could generate a substantial fee that could be reinvested before the deadline. But their refusal to accept Chelsea's initial offer has slowed progress, leaving them at risk of being left with two disgruntled wingers and no financial uplift.",
      "As the clock ticks down, the futures of Garnacho, Sancho and several Chelsea attackers remain interconnected. The resolution of Chelsea's outgoing business may ultimately determine whether United can cash in - and whether two of their most unsettled players finally find fresh starts elsewhere.",
      "What transpires in the coming days could reshape squads at both Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, and send ripples across the European market.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has expressed concern over new signing Benjamin Sesko and admitted \"I don't know what he is\" after two substitute appearances.",
      "United bought Sesko from Red Bull Leipzig for £72million this summer but the Slovenian international is yet to make his first start under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He played the final 25 minutes of their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on the opening day and was sent on for 37 minutes in the 1-1 draw at Fulham on Sunday, failing to make an impact in either game.",
      "Amorim has been desperate for a reliable new striker who can guarantee his United side a steady supply of goals but in both games so far he has used Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount in attack. None of them are out-and-out forwards.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand said he couldn't understand why Sesko wasn't receiving the ball more to help him show off his true ability, saying it was hindering his progress at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Get the ball into him,\" he told his Rio Ferdinand Presents show on YouTube. \"He isn’t going to be an easy day’s work. Get it into him and make them defend. But we are playing it around him. Sometimes it’s like really basic, fundamental things.",
      "\"Get it into someone who can cause problems but we go against that. So that was my main concern, you are not getting to see who he is.\"",
      "Ferdinand said it would be better to get Sesko on the ball even if he makes mistakes because it was difficult to see what kind of player United have signed.",
      "\"I would rather you play it into him and he look rubbish so we know what we’ve got because, right now, I don’t know what he is or what he’s doing. I’m not pointing the finger but you have got to help your team-mates find their feet in the team.\"",
      "Sesko - who scored 21 goals last season - was tipped to replace Rasmus Hojlund, who has suffered some poor form since his own big-money move to United in 2023. Sesko will hope to get more minutes in the coming games against Grimsby and Burnley.",
      "Ferdinand was also critical of United's performance in general against Fulham, claiming Amorim's side failed to make their dominance count and accused his old team of \"letting them off the hook\".",
      "He added: \"I would have thought every Fulham fan, player and member of staff would have been going, 'What’s happening here? This isn’t the Manchester United we were expecting to see'.",
      "\"At those moments there, the best teams punish the weak. They put their foot on their throat and say, “Stay there”, and that’s what we didn’t do. We let them off the hook.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could consider leaving Manchester United this summer after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim. Mainoo, a graduate of the Red Devils academy, has seen his options limited this season.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder has twice been named on the bench this season but has not played a single minute. And it now appears that a lack of minutes could force the youngster to look elsewhere.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Mainoo would consider quitting Old Trafford should United receive an acceptable offer for his services. Chelsea have previously been linked with a swoop, while the midfielder himself is reportedly open to the prospect of moving abroad.",
      "Mainoo has just under two years remaining on his contract with United. It was previously thought that Red Devils chiefs were keen on tying him down to a new contract but there remains a big gap in salary expectations.",
      "Mainoo was reportedly looking for around £150,000 per week to sign a new deal, an amount that is unfeasible for United at the current time. Should Mainoo move on then any fee that the club receives would be considered as pure profit in their PSR calculations for the forthcoming financial year.",
      "Asked why he left Mainoo on the bench against Fulham, United boss Amorim revealed that the youngster was now competing with captain Bruno Fernandes. He said: \"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno.",
      "“And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United icon Gary Neville has not ruled out the prospect of Mainoo falling even further down the pecking order in the immediate future. “In central midfield, they have to do a piece of business now,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it is quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim isn’t having him. He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and he then brings Ugarte on in front of him. That tells you he is almost fourth choice really.",
      "“That means they are going to have to get something sorted because it is going to be a problem. The two in there really do get exposed when the front three are a little bit higher and the back five sometimes get pushed back a bit, those acres of space seem to open up a bit.",
      "“I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he is going to have to sort it out. I think Man United will have to get a goalkeeper and look at getting a central midfield player.”",

      "Wing-back Dorgu, who joined United in January, started both games and admitted there is no hiding place for Ruben Amorim and his players after last season's humiliating showing.",
      "“Everyone has a point to prove this season,” said Dorgu. “We need to get back to Europe, so I feel like if we are as a group, we are ready to perform on the pitch.",
      "“We need to stick together, be happy, positive, and try to do what the coach asks. We definitely understand more. We understand what he [Amorim] wants us to do and obviously, now we're not in Europe, we have more training.",

      "At the other end of the table, newly promoted Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland have been busy to varying degrees and all three have started the campaign with a home win and an away loss. James Justin is poised to be the latest in a long line of new additions for the promoted sides, leaving Leicester for Leeds.",
      "As Newcastle prepare to welcome Liverpool on Monday night, plenty of the talk will be about Alexander Isak. The striker maintains his career on Tyneside is over, though it'll take a league record bid for Liverpool to bring him to Anfield.",

      "\"As I have said so many times and it has been shown, I could even impact the game on Friday with the players we had on the bench. It would be much nicer to talk about the players that we have. I understand why you have to ask the question.\"",
      "Chelsea's discussions over an Alejandro Garnacho move appear to have been productive, at least when it comes to getting the player on side. It's a different story as far as the fee is concerned, though.",
      "The Blues are believed to value the winger at around £25million. United still want more, though - even if the £70m being mentioned back in January would be a tall order.",
      "Last year, Chelsea left it until the very last minute to sign Jadon Sancho on loan from United. This could be another one which goes right to the wire.",
      "Earlier in the window, it was suggested that Sancho had turned down Roma. Now, though, Giallorossi boss Gian Piero Gasperini has denied that is the case.",
      "Bayern Munich have also been linked with the winger, though reports in Germany suggest that might not be a goer. Bayern have lost Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman this summer, but it appears they may go after different targets to Sancho.",
      "After sitting out Manchester United's pre-season tour, Sancho doesn't appear to have an Old Trafford future. The question now concerns where he might end up.",
      "With Manchester United closing in on Senne Lammens, it appears Donnarumma won't be off to Old Trafford this summer. However, the Italian could yet move to the Premier League.",
      "Manchester City have already signed one keeper this summer, with James Trafford returning to the club. He had a nervy game against Spurs on Saturday, costing his term a goal, but feels like one for the present and future.",
      "That said, City could sell two keepers in the coming week, and that would leave them in need of another new face. If Ederson and Stefan Ortega both leave, Donnarumma may well be battling it out with Trafford for a starting spot.",
      "AC Milan's pursuit of Rasmus Hojlund may be back on, after Victor Boniface failed a medical over a San Siro move. However, they're not the only Serie A side in the mix.",
      "Napoli have money to spend after cashing in on Victor Osimhen over the summer. Kevin De Bruyne has already joined on a free, and now it's time to find someone for the Belgian to feed.",
      "According to reports in Italy, former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has been attempting to talk Hojlund into a move to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. This will certainly be one to keep an eye on.",
      "Unlike some of the other players on this list, Simons has continued to play for his club despite mounting speculation over his future. The Dutch international played in RB Leipzig's opening day defeat to Bayern Munich, and also got an outing in the cup.",
      "Chelsea have had a busy summer already, with Estevao and Jamie Gittens both arriving to bolster the attack. However, they might not be done, with sales - including the imminent exit of Carney Chukwuemeka - helping raise funds.",
      "Another player who could yet leave Stamford Bridge this summer si Nicolas Jackson. The Senegal star is behind Liam Delap and Joao Pedro in the pecking order, and Newcastle might be able to offer him a route out.",
      "We finish back with Liverpool. The Reds were left wanting at the back against Bournemouth in their league opener, and Giovanni Leoni - who signed on the afternoon of that game - might not be the only centre-back to join this month.",
      "Crystal Palace captain Guehi has been a long-time target for the Reds, and is now in the final year of his contract in South London. Liverpool's initial offers fell short of Palace's valuation, but it remains to be seen whether that value will be reduced to ensure he doesn't run down his contract and leave for nothing last summer.",
      "In the meantime, Guehi has continued to skipper the club. He hasn't missed a minute yet this season, playing both league games and helping Oliver Glasner's side claim a 1-0 first leg win in their Conference League play-off against Fredrikstad.",

      "Gary Lineker slammed the penalty decision in the draw between Manchester United and Fulham on Sunday, claiming he couldn't tell which team was getting the spot-kick. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty in the first-half of the visit to Craven Cottage, after it was determined that Calvin Bassey had fouled Mason Mount in the goalmouth during a corner.",
      "However, the typically reliable Bruno Fernandes skied his 12-yard striker over the bar, with no goals coming until the second half of the game. Leny Yoro looked to have opened the scoring in the 58th minute with a glancing header - but this was later ruled a Rodrigo Muniz own goal.",
      "Seconds after coming on, Emile Smith Rowe equalised in the 73rd minute, and while both teams pushed for that all-important winner, it finished 1-1 and United grabbed their first point of the season. However, Lineker wasn't best pleased with his trip to west London, as he shared his confusion during the VAR decision.",
      "While discussing United's struggles on the Rest is Football podcast, the ex-Tottenham Hotspur star said: \"They got a penalty, which my goodness, what a bizarre experience. You know, going to the game, we're watching the game, there's a corner and then the ball's cleared, the balls goes up to the other end of the pitch and Fulham's on the attack.",
      "\"Then suddenly the ref stops and you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Now, I know the experience is probably different at home, but if you're in the ground, Oh my. Then you look at, you see a sign saying VAR penalty check. And I was honestly sitting there and I said 'For which team, who to?'",
      "\"I didn't even know whether it was that end or that end, and you had no idea what was going on. I mean, it's such an awful experience for fans.\"",
      "Lineker added: \"I mean, I know now they're telling you why they changed their decision, which he ultimately did. I couldn't see from how far we were away, so I had no idea whether it should have been overturned.",
      "\"But Bruno missed it anyway, blazed it over the bar. But they've got to actually tell you what's going on for the fans in the ground to hear it. There's a penalty check because so and so, we think he might have pushed so and so, but we're checking all the angles.\"",
      "When co-host Alan Shearer questioned Lineker's thoughts on the penalty decision itself, the popular pundit agreed that it was the right decision to award it. The 64-year-old went on to give Ruben Amorim's side some praise for their improvement on the previous campaign, despite United not winning a game yet in the 2025/26 season.",
      "He added: \"United started really well, I thought, 'Oh, hello,' because last week I thought they showed something, even though they lost, and the first 15 to 20 minutes you thought, 'Mm, okay'. Cunha was electric, went really close [with] a brilliant effort, hit the post.",
      "\"Another one blazed over the bar, he had a one on one with the keeper where he probably should've scored but a good save from Leno and you thought, 'Well, there's something here.'\"",
      "Reflecting on the missed opportunity, manager Amorim admitted that while he doesn't feel the \"urgency\" that fans may be dealing with, he believes the team has to manage the game better once they are ahead.",
      "Speaking to MUTV post-match, the Portuguese boss said: \"In this moment, we need to think about the performance. Of course I’m not crazy, I know what the feeling is of the players that play in the team that they have to win every match.",
      "\"But I felt that in the past, I don’t feel a lack of urgency in this moment. What I felt is that we missed the penalty, we missed some chances and then we score and I have the feeling that now we have to defend this goal.",
      "\"That is not a lack of urgency, it may be urgency in the opposite side. We just need to focus on our movement and the way we have to play the game.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"It’s normal [that Fulham are dangerous from corners]. I think we tried to press high and, after one or two times, we need to understand that sometimes we need to manage the game, to wait for the opponent. That was the option of Fulham and sometimes we push the ball to the side too soon.",
      "\"It was quite easy for the opponent to mark us and we wanted to press all of the time. We wanted to do that but sometimes we have to be better in that moment, understand the game, try to drop a little bit and start the pressure, so they had more space than us when they were attacking.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fulham boss Marco Silva was much more critical of the refereeing decisions throughout the game, particularly at United's goal - where he felt it should have been disallowed for a foul.",
      "Addressing the media post-match, Silva said: \"I would like to explain everything about the VAR decisions this afternoon, but I can't. I can't because they were different in many different ways. They were unbelievable seeing two fouls at the same time, Shaw on Rodrigo and Bassey on Mount at the same time, both fouls, and they saw that Bassey foul was half of a half second before the Shaw foul on Muniz.",
      "\"Then the second one [the United goal]. I think what I saw is what everyone saw in the stadium; everyone around the world saw it. Two players were isolated at a corner and one player pushed the other to head the ball. If you go by the rules you know what is going to happen.",
      "\"I would like those types of decisions to always be the same. Simple as that.\"",
      "United will travel to League Two side Grimsby Town next in the second round of the Carabao Cup, before a visit from newly-promoted Burnley on August 30. Silva's side will face Bristol City next in the cup, before a tricky test at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "The £206m summer spending spree might just have turned Manchester United’s best player into a big problem.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was United’s saviour last season and the last player they needed to fix because he delivered goals, assists and made the whole team tick. But now, Fernandes looks lost in United’s new-look line-up as the game passes him by and his effectiveness has waned in Ruben Amorim’s team.",
      "United have bought themselves a superstar front three with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. They have invested heavily and gone all-out attack. There are exciting signs with Cunha already embracing the United No. 10 shirt and looking like an exciting maverick. Mbeumo has talent, skill and vision while Sesko cost £73m and, when he is finally fit to start, has got so many qualities as a classic No. 9.",
      "But there can be no doubt that United’s cavalier approach on the pitch and in the transfer market is having such an effect on their main man and captain.",
      "Fernandes will clearly be expected to slot back into a deeper midfield role and, in Sunday’s draw at Fulham, he was expected to do all the running too because Casemiro’s legs cannot carry him as far as they used to.",
      "Even worse, Casemiro always looks like he is a red card waiting to happen as he was hooked in the second half because he was on a booking.",
      "His replacement, Manuel Ugarte, clearly has not done enough to convince United boss Amorim that he is the answer either and they just do not have that quality in midfield.",
      "Clearly, all of Fernandes’ failings were brought into sharper focus by the fact that he sent a penalty sailing over the bar and a few fingers have been pointed at the midfield for not tracking runs on Emile Smith Rowe’s equaliser.",
      "United have a problem of their own making and to make it out of last season’s best player is, well, just typical United. Now the squad looks unbalanced - and they only have a week to fix it. They are crying out for a midfield general who arguably could make it work with Fernandes in a deeper role if that is what is needed.",
      "But, like with many things, United went for broke in attack and then neglected other key but obvious areas like in midfield and with the keeper.",
      "It is baffling as to why United did not go for someone like Joao Palhinha who joined Tottenham because he was surplus to requirements at Bayern Munich. Palhinha is on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent £26m switch. When United have spent all their dough up front, that would have been just perfect.",
      "They are also scrambling around for a new keeper because all of their current options are not good enough.",
      "At least they have fixed their forward line and made the supporters dream. When all three are fit and ready to start together, they will take some stopping.",
      "But it will have to be a case of them scoring one more than the opposition because, at this rate, the midfield will not offer the defence any protection and the keeper already looks exposed. Meanwhile, they are not getting the best out of their main man in Fernandes.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville maintained the continued struggles of goalkeeper Altay Bayindir should worry Ruben Amorim's side. Bayindir was at fault for Arsenal's winner on the opening weekend of the season and had another nervy moment against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Turkish international Bayindir flapped at a corner again at Craven Cottage. On this occasion, striker Rodrigo Muniz was unable to take advantage, but that didn't stop Neville from worrying.",
      "The scores were level at the time of the nervy moment for Bayindir, after Bruno Fernandes skied a penalty for United. The game ended all-square, with Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser cancelling out a Muniz own goal.",
      "United sit 16th in the table with just one point from their two matches. Last season's first-choice keeper Andre Onana was back on the bench after missing out entirely against Arsenal, but a new number one could yet arrive in the next seven days.",
      "Italy and Paris Saint-Germain keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had emerged as a surprise target, only for Manchester City to join the chase for the Champions League winner. Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens could end up being United's man, and the young Belgian sat out his team's Sunday afternoon win.",
      "Lammens' form for Antwerp last season earned him a first senior Belgium call-up in March, but he was absent for the match against Mechelen over the weekend. Antwerp ended the game with 10 men after former Leicester midfielder Dennis Praet was sent off, but they still won 2-1 to continue their unbeaten start to the season.",
      "\"I am focused on our goalkeepers,\" United boss Ruben Amorim told Match of the Day after his team's draw in West London. \"Like every manager I look at the amount of training, what I see in pre-season, in the games and try to decide who is the best goalkeeper to use in a game and I am going to continue to do that.\"",
      "\"You can look at it both sides,\" he said when asked about Bayindir being targeted at corners. \"We have a goal with a goal kick, we have two situations where we could manage to score, a penalty and the corner kick. In every game in the Premier League, you will always have situations in the corners.\"",

And with Benjamin Sesko arriving for big money earlier in the transfer window, Hojlund has fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "There has been plenty of interest in the Denmark international's services from Italy this summer following Hojlund's time in Serie A with Atalanta. And while previous reports have indicated Hojlund is keen to stay and fight for his place, a move away is now close.",

      "The Scotland midfielder, 28, has enjoyed tremendous success since joining Napoli, with his stellar form during last year's Scudetto-winning campaign - where he scored 12 times in 34 league games - even earning him a Ballon d'Or nomination.",
      "The report adds that McTominay's call is likely to be 'decisive' in Hojlund agreeing to return to Italy with Napoli pushing for a loan deal with an obligation to make the move permanent later down the line. It's said United would consider a proposal which includes a €5million (£4.3m) loan fee plus a mandatory purchase price of €40m (£34.5m).",

      "Problems are surfacing at Manchester United and they are of their own making. Amorim is continuing to play their third-best goalkeeper, the midfield is brazenly targeted, the supporters in the Putney End hollered, “attack, attack, attack” in the 83rd minute and two centre backs emerged four minutes later.",

      "Those wins are scattered like a trail that has run out of bread crumbs: two in December, two in January, one in February, one in March and one in May. Three of the victories were against teams now in the Championship.",
      "Amorim dismissed the suggestion that United’s sudden change of plan midway through pre-season has affected their form. Since he removed Rasmus Hojlund from the starting XI and switched to a strikerless side against Everton in Atlanta, none of United's starters have scored from open play in four games.",
      "Including pre-season, United’s form with and without Hojlund reads:",

      "The intention to sell Hojlund is understandable. He is not good enough to lead the line for United, he tallied three goals in his last 35 appearances for the club and they have replaced him.",
      "But Amorim has cut off his nose to spite his face with a striker who has had one cameo since he bullishly told journalists in Chicago that he was intent on staying. United were crying out for a striker, bought one for £73.62million, and have not started him.",
      "Watching Benjamin Sesko, you can see why. “I think he needs time,” Amorim admitted. “It’s not easy. Sometimes you are on the bench and go to the game and the game is really fast, he’s understanding that the game is even faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "“But he is fighting, he had some good connections with teammates, I felt that when he was on the pitch we were not in our best moment and that can change the way you see a player.”",
      "All the more reason to play a No.9. United could have maximised Hojlund, scorer of two goals on his last start against Bournemouth in Chicago, until Sesko was up to speed. Hojlund might have been more sellable and valuable, too.",
      "Instead, Matheus Cunha has had to double as a centre forward when he earned his move on his playmaking prowess. He ought to have converted his chance from Altay Bayindir’s punt, a scenario identical to Cunha's majestic goal at the same end for Wolves last season.",
      "Swapping the old gold for the red of United puts a player in a different mindset. Even one as classy as Cunha. He has been as confident and swashbuckling as he was for Wolves, only when he faultlessly controlled the ball he could not place it beyond Bernd Leno’s reach.",
      "United are in paradoxical form. Their attacking trident has created good chances and they are more fluid than rigid. Mason Mount had one of his most accomplished hours in a United shirt at Fulham. Yet they failed to get on the scoresheet and United’s periods of play with Sesko, an actual striker, have been unproductive.",
      "Mount is the last United player to score from open play, against Everton three weeks ago. Since United touched down back on these shores, their two goals, against Fiorentina in a friendly and at Fulham, have been own goals.",
      "“I think it’s a normal thing and when you reach this level,” Amorim said about the no-striker strategy. “Cunha can play as a striker and as a 10 at his former club.",
      "“I felt that during these last games with Mason Mount sometimes we are more robust in the way we play. So we are going to change according to the result and the opponent and try to win games.”",
      "Amorim’s stubbornness is the same at the other end. Retaining Bayindir was a contrarian call. He is demonstrably not United’s best goalkeeper and, though his afternoon at Fulham was devoid of a costly error, he was jittery again at corners.",
      "United need certainty in goal. Senne Lammens, the Belgian goalkeeper United are expected to sign, is not viewed as an outright No.1. So why persist playing the back-up goalie when the first-choice is fit enough to take the train to Euston?",
      "The prospect of United accommodating four goalkeepers this season is improbable. Tom Heaton is 39, has not played in two-and-a-half years and signed a new one-year contract in June. Bayindir has started in six of United’s seven games since the start of pre-season and Onana has not played since the post-season tour match in Kuala Lumpur yet is adamant he is staying.",
      "Mount dropped back into midfield nine days after Amorim mentioned him as an option to fill in there. He had to after Casemiro, on a yellow card, diced with death by sliding in late on Sander Berge. Amorim immediately summoned his first substitutes.",
      "Starting Casemiro on a weekly basis in the Premier League is an admission of defeat. This is his last season at United and they recruited a replacement last year. Manuel Ugarte, totally devoid of confidence, does not appear up to it and the interest in Carlos Baleba would suggest some at United have given up on the Uruguayan. Erik ten Hag was not sold on Ugarte and Amorim, who coached him at Sporting Lisbon, has benched him.",
      "At Craven Cottage last season, Amorim admitted he felt like he had aged ten years at United. Worry signs are forming again.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is modelling for a commercial partner and Kobbie Mainoo is recording snippets for the Chinese New Year. Luke Shaw arrives to speak with club media in another room.",
      "Three Manchester United correspondents have been invited to speak with Patrick Dorgu, who is slightly late for his engagement after spending time with young season ticket holders.",
      "United's press officer briefly speaks to Dorgu before ushering journalists into the new-look press conference room. Dorgu is about to speak for 16 minutes, touching on his desire to win the Premier League this season, his blossoming relationship with Matheus Cunha, finding his feet in Manchester after a ruthless introduction to English football and Rasmus Hojlund's future.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was a difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "United signed Dorgu from Lecce for £25million, with a potential £4.1m in add-ons, in the January transfer window, and United won just three Premier League matches after his arrival.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Dorgu was thrown into the deep end. However, he was a heavily data-driven signing and the numbers suggested he would be able to swim.",
      "Staff have noticed a difference in Dorgu in recent weeks. He is more confident, more willing to speak. He has become comfortable at Carrington, which should be reflected in his performances.",
      "And against Arsenal, he struck the post from distance, a shot he admits he would not have had the confidence to take last season.",
      "\"It's a new season and everyone did well in pre-season,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to play myself into the team more. Just give the fans what they deserve and I think everyone is trying to put United where we need to be.\"",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "Which big clubs in Italy were interested? \"I'm not going to say,\" he laughed.",
      "The 20-year-old was signed for Ruben Amorim's system and is first-choice at left wing-back.",
      "\"In Denmark, I was playing wing-back. Then when I moved to Lecce, I was playing left back, and then the last season before I moved to United, I was playing more as a winger,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just easier to attack as a wing back than as a full back - I feel comfortable in that role. But I could still do the job as I full back, but it's just less attacking.\"",
      "Regarding his current role, he added: \"I think just a lot of runs, like being more attacking. I could have been more attacking last season and I feel like in pre-season I've improved that a little bit. It's just to attack more [Amorim's message], get into the box, help the team create more chances.",
      "\"I like to tackle, I like to attack, I like to score goals, gain assists, so I think just to play wing back, you need to be all around, you need to be good at tackling, you need to be good at defensive work as well.\"",
      "Amorim's formation has been scrutinised, so what does Dorgu think? \"It depends what system you're playing against. You can always drop alongside the centre backs to make it a 4-3-3,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just about adapting to who you're playing against and just help each other, move for each other, and then it's not really about the system. It's more like how you're dealing with it.",
      "\"It's up to you how you want to play. If the midfielders feel like they're getting man-marked, then they can move down [towards defence], get the ball, and then play. You just need to move.",
      "\"Obviously, you're not just going to move around [anywhere]. I can't just run to the right side, but you can move in your position.\"",
      "Speaking about Amorim, Dorgu added: \"He's a really good guy, he's positive with everyone and always defending you. He always tries to help you play the game, so he knows how it is.",
      "\"We definitely understand more [what Amorim wants]. We understand what he wants us to do, and obviously, now that we're not in Europe, we have more training.",
      "\"He has more time for us to really understand his ideas. Obviously, we want to go back to playing many games. Now we have the time to do it and then we need to perform this season.\"",
      "Dorgu has grand ambitions: to win the Premier League and play at the 2026 World Cup for Denmark. When asked whether United can return to Europe, he responded: \"100 per cent, we are aiming to win the Premier League and we just need to take it game by game.\"",
      "Amorim has explained the internal target is European qualification. United are planning to win the Premier League by 2028, but Dorgu is impatient and insists it should be the aim this season.",
      "\"100 per cent. We are Manchester United, so that's always going to be our goal,\" he added.",
      "The reality is United are a world away from winning the title. The morale in the dressing room improved this summer, but the 1-1 draw against Fulham is a reminder that results must also improve.",
      "\"I think the facilities help, I think new signings have helped as well,\" Dorgu said. \"They bring a lot of good energy, quality into the group. We tried to be positive about our new season.",
      "\"Everyone has a point to prove this season. We need to get back to Europe, so I feel like if we are as a group and ready to perform on the pitch. We need to stick together, be happy, positive, and try to do what the coach asks.\"",
      "Dorgu is no longer the new face at Old Trafford with this summer seeing a trio of expensive attacking reinforcements join, including Matheus Cunha. When he arrived from Wolves he told Dorgu not to kick him, a reference to their encounter at Old Trafford last season.",
      "\"He had me once when I got a yellow card,\" recalled Dorgu. \"Besides that, he was quiet in the game. Matheus is a really public guy, like he talks a lot and he's really funny - he's trying to engage with everyone so it's easier to talk with him because he has a lot of energy.",
      "\"I feel like he's really, really good at driving with the ball, getting past players, and I feel like with my runs and what I can do will help him to do that, and get more space to play, and we just need to connect well, like me and him.",
      "\"Obviously, there other players as well. It's not only on the left side, we need to attack on both sides. It helps getting Cunha in because he's really good at what he's doing and he's going to help the team.\"",
      "Although Dorgu admitted he \"gets on\" with everyone in the dressing room, he nominated Hojlund as his closest friend. \"Probably Ras because he's Danish and I know him from when I was younger,\" he said. \"I played against him when I was at Nordsjælland and he was at Copenhagen.\"",
      "Hojlund has been left of the squad for succesive games and is expected to leave before the transfer deadline. \"Obviously, we don't know if he's leaving. He is training with us and he's part of the team,\" said Dorgu.",
      "\"You need to talk to the coach about why he was not in the squad. But if he ended up leaving, that's part of the game, everyone is not secure to be here. Obviously I would still see him with the national team.\"",
      "Dorgu looked in high spirits in the photographs of himself playing football with 13 young season ticket holders on the morning of the interview. The children were selected to take part in a skills workshop with Manchester United Foundation coaches and were treated to Dorgu's presence.",
      "United say the aim of such fan engagement activities is to provide memorable experiences for their most loyal supporters, to increase understanding between fans and players of each others’ perspectives, and, ultimately, to strengthen the bond between the fans and the team.",
      "Dorgu wants to further strentghen the bond with matchgoing fans by winning games again.",

      "Ruben Amorim has stressed that new Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko \"needs time\".",
      "United paid just under £74million to sign Sesko and the 22-year-old has started both of their Premier League matches against Arsenal and Fulham on the bench.",
      "Sesko only played 45 minutes in pre-season for RB Leipzig before he joined United just over two weeks ago and Amorim has opted for a strikerless side amid United's efforts to sell Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Slovenia international Sesko came on 13 minutes earlier at Craven Cottage, with the game goalless, than he did on his debut a week earlier.",
      "\"I think he needs time,\" Amorim said of Sesko. \"It’s not easy. Sometimes you are on the bench and go to the game and the game is really fast, he’s understanding that the game is even faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "\"But he is fighting, he had some good connections with teammates, I felt that when he was on the pitch we were not in our best moment and that can change the way you see a player.",
      "\"So I’m really happy because he’s putting in all the effort, we just need to be in a better moment sometimes to help him to show the talent he has.\"",
      "United have won only seven of Amorim's 29 games in charge in the Premier League after Fulham came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",
      "Burnley visit Old Trafford next Saturday but United commence their domestic cup programme with a League Cup second round tie at Grimsby Town on Wednesday.",
      "Wholesale changes are probable against the League Two team three days before United host newly-promoted Burnley, who beat Sunderland on Saturday.",

We want to win so bad we forget about maintaining possession, push the opponent, we just gave a little bit of the game to Fulham.",
      "\"We start really well, until the goal I think we were a good team, we can do better. After the goal, I think we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage. We cannot do that.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Kobbie Mainoo is in competition with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo was unused for the second week running in United's 1-1 draw at Fulham, as Amorim sent on four defensive players in the second half.",
      "The only outright attacking change by the United head coach was the introduction of new striker Benjamin Sesko as Mainoo and striker Joshua Zirkzee remained in the dugout.",
      "Mason Mount dropped back into central midfield following the substitution of Casemiro with the game goalless. Defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte replaced Mount in the 69th minute with United 1-0 up.",

      "Amorim favours an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder in his 3-4-2-1 system and Fernandes remains an automatic pick.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",

      "Manchester United have under a week to conclude their summer transfer business.",
      "The window closes at 7pm on Monday (September 1), which is earlier than in previous years. United still have work to do in the market and are set to be busy, particularly because outgoings still need to be arranged.",
      "Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, but there could be more additions before the deadline.",
      "So we've taken a closer look at the deals United could still complete.",
      "Lammens was omitted from the Royal Antwerp squad last weekend. United are pushing ahead in negotiations to sign the keeper for a reported €20million (£17m) and he is expected to be Amorim's latest recruit.",
      "Lammens, 23, is a young goalkeeper who could challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. He stands at 6ft 3in, represents Belgium Under-21s and is seen as a goalkeeper with a bright future.",
      "United enquired about Baleba earlier in the window. Brighton value the midfielder at around £100m and have planned for him to stay at the Amex Stadium in 2025/2026, so a late move is highly unlikely.",
      "Having said that, football has a tendency to surprise and United haven't made a great start in the Premier League, so could they be tempted to test Brighton's stance with a late bid?",
      "It's possible, of course, but Brighton have expressed confidence that Baleba will stay, and it's probably wishful thinking that United could make a dramatic swoop for the midfielder.",
      "Onana's future is uncertain after he was named on the bench against Fulham last weekend. Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir, despite his mistake against Arsenal..",
      "United take on Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday. If Onana is not recalled to the starting team, he could make a dramatic move away before the deadline.",
      "For now, sources are adamant that Onana is staying, but a lot can change in a week and the pieces are being moved around the board in the goalkeeper department at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea are the frontrunners to sign Alejandro Garnacho, but United are determined not to allow the youngster to leave for a fee below his market value in the final weeks of the transfer window. Garnacho has been training on his own at Carrington since reporting for pre-season in July.",
      "Roma contacted United to discuss Sancho on loan, with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italian club could not agree on personal terms with the outcast winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic about his expectations for his next destination.",
      "Antony is believed to be holding out for a transfer to Real Betis. The Brazilian was hugely successful during his loan with Betis last season, but the Spanish club are struggling to finance a permanent deal.",
      "The player's agent has left the door open to Saudi Arabia. \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status,\" he said. \"We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "Hojlund was dropped from the squad to face Arsenal in the Premier League and did not travel to Craven Cottage to face Fulham because he is set to leave before the transfer deadline.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Amorim said: \"It is our player - we have to make choices. We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside. He has to fight for his place. We will see what's going to happen. Rasmus has the same characteristics as Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",
      "Italian champions, Napoli, are understood to be pushing to wrap up a deal for Hojlund.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal and Fulham, raising concerns about where he fits into the team again. \"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo on Sunday.",
      "Mainoo's contract situation has stalled and the MEN reported in March that there was a genuine chance United and the youngster could go their separate ways in the summer window.",
      "There has been no breakthrough in contract talks and could he better off leaving for regular starts elsewhere?",
      "Malacia celebrated his 26th birthday this week and interest has been thin on the ground following his loan with PSV, although Roma have been linked with a move for the defender.",

      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022.",
      "When a team changes manager and the dust settles following the initial hysteria, often one of the first questions to be asked is which players will benefit most from the new man's arrival.",
      "If a manager can start to get a tune out of an expensive recruit who has so far failed to prove their worth, they've instant credit in the bank from fans and those within the club's hierarchy.",
      "But there's a lot more to it than 'they played well under them before and so this time should be no different'. Take Erik ten Hag's arrival at United as an example.",
      "The Dutchman was keen to surround himself with home comforts, regularly targeting players either from, or who had spent time in, the Eredivisie. Yet, having inherited a player he had coached previously at Ajax in Donny van de Beek, he failed to get the best out of the midfielder, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had before him, and Van de Beek was shipped off to Girona after playing just eight league games in two years under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ruben Amorim was appointed United manager in November 2024, it would be wrong to suggest there was instant hope that he could get the best out of Manuel Ugarte. The pair worked together at Sporting Lisbon, and with Ugarte not even three months into his United career, the jury was well and truly still out on the Uruguayan.",
      "Fast forward nine months and there is a real worry Amorim will not get to see the best of the 24-year-old midfielder at United.",
      "Ugarte was brought to United for a fee rising to £50.75million on transfer deadline day last summer. The Uruguay international was signed to be the successor to Casemiro in United's midfield, yet the man he was brought in to replace has started ahead of him in both Premier League games so far this season.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star showed glimpses of promise during pre-season, most notably against West Ham where he was one of the best players on the pitch in a 2-1 win in New Jersey. He again looked bright off the bench against Bournemouth, but regressed dramatically against Everton in the final game of the US tour and has not been seen in a starting XI since.",
      "Opting to start the 33-year-old Casemiro in Premier League games, as brilliant as he once was, is an admission of defeat.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 by the time the 2025/26 season comes to an end, and having been on a downward slope for more than 18 months, having him as one of your starting central midfielders when the bell rings at 7pm on September 1 simply isn't an option.",
      "It's up to Amorim to make it work with Ugarte, but if he thinks Casemiro is a safer bet in midfield than the man he worked with at Sporting Lisbon then he clearly doesn't think it will work.",
      "There's still time for deals to be done before the transfer window closes. Over to you, United.",

      "That was Marcus Rashford, who completed a loan move to Barcelona, while Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho are yet to resolve their futures.",
      "As players continue to be linked with a move to and from Old Trafford, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest transfer rumours.",
      "United's anticipated signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is expected to trigger the sale of one of their current goalkeepers before the transfer window closes, according to Football Insider.",
      "The report states that either Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir could be leaving, while Tom Heaton is expected to remain at the club as the third-choice goalkeeper.",
      "On the Reds' interest, former Tottenham Hotspur striker Vincent Janssen, who is said to have a good relationship with Senne Lammens, offered an insight into the goalkeeper to Het Laatste Nieuws.",
      "He said: \"Senne is one of the few guys who really doesn't say much about such things. We read more in the media than we hear from Senne himself.",
      "\"He's very calm about it. Well, wherever he signs, he'll definitely be able to make a fantastic move. He deserves it. Senne has already proven he can handle a step up.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: Inevitably, bringing in a new goalkeeper creates uncertainty for the existing options, particularly when both Bayindir and Onana have struggled to consistently perform. The arrival of fresh competition could push one of them out, as the club seeks a more reliable presence between the sticks and looks to strengthen a position that has been far from convincing this season. It remains unclear which goalkeeper will depart should the deal for Lammens be completed.",
      "Fabrizio Romano is reporting that negotiations between United and Napoli for Rasmus Hojlund are at the 'final stages.'",
      "He claims a deal will initially be on a loan basis and the Serie A side will have an option that could become mandatory. Napoli are believed to be in talks with Hojlund over personal terms.",
      "MEN Sport says: It’s good to see some clarity finally emerging for Hojlund. Although he had expressed a willingness to fight for his place under Amorim, the arrival of Sesko made it clear that regular playing time would be hard to come by. A loan move is therefore a sensible decision, giving Hojlund the chance to gain valuable minutes, continue his development, and build confidence away from the pressure of competing for limited opportunities at the club. This could be the perfect opportunity for him to return stronger and more prepared for top-level football.",

      "Manchester United have just a week left to strengthen their squad before the summer transfer window closes at 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "It may be early days in the 2025/26 campaign, but all evidence so far suggests that the Reds still have plenty of work to do. That will surprise few after such a disastrous campaign last term, and yet the scale of United's rebuild often causes astonishment.",
      "The key areas that need filling are goalkeeper and a new central midfielder, with both positions exposed in the two Premier League matches Ruben Amorim's side have played so far. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both struggled over the last year or so, and there will be hope that Senne Lammens can step up if his move from Royal Antwerp is completed.",
      "United need a reliable No.1 who can feature every week for Amorim's team. It's a position they have badly struggled with since David de Gea's peak in ended in the early 2020s and there must be serious question marks over whether Lammens can step up to such a high-pressured role at just 23.",
      "In terms of midfield - Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba would be the dream addition. Of course, his £100million plus price tag will make any deal extremely unlikely this summer.",
      "But sales would boost United's PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) position and raise the remote possibility that he could arrive at Old Trafford by next month. That would almost certainly have to rely on what happens to the club's wantaway stars and Rasmus Hojlund, who has no place under Amorim after Benjamin Sesko's arrival.",
      "So far, only Marcus Rashford's loan exit has taken place, and even though his wages will save United around £12m, it's not enough. It has been claimed last week that talks are advancing over a deal that will see Alejandro Garnacho join Chelsea.",
      "United are said to want £50m for their academy graduate - a fee which would represent a huge PSR boost. The player's homegrown status would mean any sale would be pure profit - allowing the club more wriggle room to bring new players in.",
      "Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are the other three players who will be keen to facilitate a move away from M16 this summer. Clubs from Italy have been linked with Sancho, and a sale would be a welcome relief for everyone after his miserable time in Manchester since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",
      "Antony, meanwhile, could be on his way back to Real Betis after a successful loan spell in La Liga last term. His move back to Spain is likely to represent a significant loss on the £82m United paid for him in 2022 and yet he has no future at Old Trafford.",
      "As for Malacia, injuries and form have put an end to his time at United for some time. Fortunately for the Reds, they only paid a more modest £14.7m to sign him three years ago, but they will still make a loss on a player who has barely featured since his debut campaign at Old Trafford three seasons ago.",

      "Sancho, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, has been frozen out by manager Ruben Amorim. As a result, he was one five players to inform the club of his wish to explore new options.",
      "Out of those five players, only Marcus Rashford has sealed a move away from Old Trafford with just a week left of the summer transfer window. Despite efforts to secure a move, reported interest from clubs such as Borussia Dortmund and Juventus has not materialised, leaving Sancho stuck in limbo.",
      "Roma have shown interest in Sancho in recent weeks, but talks have stalled amid suggestions that the England winger is reluctant to make the move to the Italian capital. Roma sporting director Frederic Massara revealed that the United winger lacked 'motivation' over a move to the Serie A.",

      "However, according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport, Sancho has not formally rejected Roma but is said to have 'hesitations' about the move - a stance that is reportedly 'tormenting' the Serie A side.",
      "The report adds that United chief Jason Wilcox is 'desperate' to remove Sancho from the wage bill, with the winger earning around £250,000 per week at Old Trafford. The club is said to have agreed a £15million transfer fee roughly a month ago.",

      "Amorim was hoping to make a better start to the campaign. The 40-year-old was backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon this summer and is targeting a return to Europe.",
      "United have played just two Premier League games, but they will have to perform better if they want to qualify for European competition after finishing 15th in a dismal 2024/2025.",

      "Manchester United are still in search of their first three points of the season after their 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal on the opening day of the season and will now turn their attention to the Carabao Cup with a game against Grimsby Town coming up this week.",
      "United have already spent big this summer, bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon, with attention now reportedly turning to the goalkeeping situation. The club reportedly hold an interest in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, though a deal is not yet close to being agreed.",
      "Nonetheless, if United are able to get a deal over the line for the young Belgian goalkeeper, then it would be another problem area addressed from last season. Andre Onana is yet to feature for the Reds this season, after picking up an injury in pre-season.",
      "The Cameroonian has been repeatedly linked with a move away from Old Trafford, though he is keen to fight for his place despite 23-year-old Lammens missing Royal Antwerp’s league game against Mechelen at the weekend in a reported attempt to avoid jeopardising a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "If United do get a deal over the line, there are a few moves still to make in the market before the window closes.",
      "Bringing in a new central midfielder to operate more defensively alongside Bruno Fernandes is a must if the club want to tick off all of their transfer priorities.",
      "Carlos Baleba of Brighton remains a target for the club, though any arrival will depend on departures. Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have all been told they can leave the club, and United will be hoping to cash in on all four this summer.",
      "There's also transfer talk linking Rasmus Hojlund with a move to Italy, having been left out of the squad to face Fulham at the weekend.",
      "Napoli are reportedly in talks with United regarding a move this summer, with an obligation to buy hugely important for Amorim's side if they want to head back into the transfer market amid an ongoing battle with PSR.",
      "Recoup some of that fee they paid for the Danish international back in 2023, sign Lammens and Baleba while also offloading the unwanted quartet for permanent fees, and United will have had an impressive window - on paper at the very least.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The Turkey international failed to connect properly after trying to punch away an Arsenal corner, but Amorim has persisted with Bayindir against Fulham and named Onana on the bench.",

      "Kavanagh didn't initially spot the incident but the video assistant referee (VAR) suggested the referee review the footage on the pitchside screen before a penalty was awarded. Fernandes unfortunately missed, his first spot-kick miss since the end of 2023.",
      "Replays showed that Kavanagh had accidentally bumped into Fernandes as the United captain walked backwards after placing the ball on the spot. Fernandes seemed to question the referee before replacing the ball and firing over the bar.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise and that was what triggered me in the moment but that's not the excuse to miss a penalty. I just had a very bad hit of the ball, I took my foot too under the ball and that's why it went over the bar.\"",
      "Amorim was also asked about the incident, but the United boss refused to get drawn into speculation that he was put off. “He knows the importance that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team,\" he said.",
      "\"And I felt that during the game, he was like, not so happy, not so involved, because he has so much responsibility. I think he felt that missed penalty, it was huge for us.”",

      "In the 53rd minute of Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Fulham on Sunday, Ruben Amorim made a decision that produced more questions than answers, one that will need addressing before the transfer window closes.",
      "United took on Fulham at Craven Cottage looking to win for the first time this season after last week's defeat to Arsenal. There wasn't a lot to split the two sides in the first-half with Bruno Fernandes' missed penalty the key talking point.",
      "After the break, Amorim gave his starting 11 just eight minutes to convince him that something was coming before changes were made. In the 53rd minute, the United boss brought off Amad for Diogo Dalot and introduced Benjamin Sesko, replacing Casemiro.",
      "The tweak in personnel saw Mason Mount, who had played as a false nine, partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield and Sesko leading the line. Predominately an attack-minded midfielder, Mount was favoured by Amorim to play a position Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are natural in.",
      "Last season, the two midfielders played a combined 82 games and there were only seven games - of the 60 United played in total - where neither featured. Following a summer where United's midfield has been under the microscope in the transfer window, the decision seems strange.",
      "After Leny Yoro's opener, United did introduce Ugarte for Mount after it became apparent that Fulham were running things in the middle of the park before two more players came on, but no sign of Mainoo.",
      "The transfer rumour mill has linked United with a catalogue of central midfielders throughout the window. At the start of the window, Joao Palhinha - who went on to join Tottenham - and Richard Rios were both linked with Corentin Tolisso, Wilfred Ndidi, Ederson, Morten Hjulmand and Felix Nmecha all following them.",
      "There is just over a week until the transfer window and there is still scope of the club signing a new midfielder, although very slim. Senne Lammens is closing in on providing more competition in the goalkeeper department but Amorim's seeming persistence to ignore Mainoo does create hope of a new midfielder coming in.",

      "The MEN revealed in January that United wanted a new goalkeeper to compete with Onana. Lammens, who was called up to the Belgium national team squad earlier this year but is yet to attain a cap, would fit that billing.

      "Once Martinez is fit, minutes could be hard to come by at senior level for Fredricson and a loan could be explored, but given the injury issues that blighted United last term and the need to carry at least five centre back options to cover the back three formation, the chances are the 20-year-old remains at Old Trafford.",

      "Man United face Fulham on Sunday in their first Premier League away match of the campaign.",
      "The Reds are set to make changes to their side following the defeat to the Gunners, with Andre Onana in line to replace Altay Bayindir in goal. The Turkey international was at fault for Arsenal's winner and Onana is now fit and has travelled to the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could be given a full debut having come off the bench last time out with United opting to play with a false nine. If the Slovenia striker does start it could be the first time United fans will see their new attacking trio from the off with Mathues Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo having also signed this summer.",

      "\"Manchester United are informed about talks and ready to get deal done if Højlund and Napoli agree on terms.\"",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes understand that United are eyeing up a move for Sevilla midfielder Agoume.",
      "After deciding against pursuing a move for Carlos Baleba, United could still sign a new midfielder before the September 1 deadline. The report suggests that Agoume could be available for a fee ranging from £21.7m to £30.4m.",
      "According to reports, United have set their sights on Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",
      "It's suggested that Stiller has a £31.5 million release clause, but it only becomes active in 2026, meaning United would likely need to pay a premium to secure him immediately.",
      "The Mail understands that Onana is expected to stay at Man United despite speculation the club may move for Senne Lammens.",
      "\"Onana is ready to play like last week so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper,\" Amorim said in his press-conference.",
      "The report claims that both United and Onana anticipate he will stay beyond the transfer window, which closes a week on Monday, despite Monaco having been quoted £30million earlier in the summer and the possibility of renewed interest from his former club Inter Milan.",
      "Meanwhile, Lammens is thought to be seen as a long-term option in goal and is expected to challenge Onana, whose future has been uncertain following a string of inconsistent displays last season."

      "Senne Lammens has been left out of Royal Antwerp's squad this weekend as Manchester United are said to be closing in on signing the Belgium international.",
      "However, they did not consider the position a priority this summer. United explored possibly taking Emiliano Martinez on loan from Aston Villa, but scoffed at suggestions they could sign Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The Belgian football journalist David Van den Broeck now reports that Lammens is close to a transfer, mentioning United. As a result, Antwerp kept the goalkeeper on the sidelines for their game against KV Mechelen on Sunday.",

      "Galatasaray, Inter and Lille are all credited with an interest in the 23-year-old, but the Mirror claims he wants a move to United. The report claims United will pay £16million plus add-ons, with Lammens expected to sign a five-year contract.",
      "The goalkeeper reputedly views a Premier League move as the platform to challenge Thibaut Courtois for the Belgium national team. Their head coach, Rudi Garcia, has twice called up Lammens; however, when the Real Madrid goalkeeper missed two World Cup qualifiers in June, Matz Sels of Nottingham Forest deputised.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and after the second weekend, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "8=) Richarlison (2)\nYou would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (2)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both."

      "Man Utd will reportedly ‘agree two deals within days’ after Altay Bayindir continued to keep his place in net for the Red Devils against Fulham.",
      "The Red Devils have had a poor start to the new season with Ruben Amorim’s side losing to Arsenal in the opening weekend before being held to a draw against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "It is not the start Amorim would have wanted after the Man Utd board decided to put their faith in him this season despite a 15th-placed finish last term.",
      "Andre Onana failed to impress in goal last season as he made a number of glaring errors and Bayindir has started both of the Red Devils’ first two matches this campaign.",
      "But Man Utd legend Gary Neville was not happy with what he saw from the Turkey international, who was at fault for Arsenal’s goal at Old Trafford last weekend, when Bayindir flapped at a Fulham corner but Rodrigo Muniz could not take advantage.",
      "READ: Mailbox: Man Utd fans are ‘deluded’ or trying to win ‘I told you so’ trophy",
      "After his side’s draw at Craven Cottage, Man Utd boss Amorim told reporters: “I am focused on our goalkeepers. Like every manager I look at the amount of training, what I see in pre-season, in the games and try to decide who is the best goalkeeper to use in a game and I am going to continue to do that.”",
      "“You can look at it both sides,” he said when asked about Bayindir being targeted at corners. “We have a goal with a goal kick, we have two situations where we could manage to score, a penalty and the corner kick. In every game in the Premier League, you will always have situations in the corners.”",
      "And now Football Insider claims that Man Utd are ‘to agree two goalkeeper deals within days’ after their disappointing result against Fulham.",
      "Man Utd ‘will sell one of their current goalkeepers in the next few days’ while Senne Lammens is ‘expected to join’ from Belgian side Antwerp before the deadline.",
      "Football Insider adds: ‘Both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir are at risk, with Tom Heaton likely to stay at Old Trafford as the third-choice option.",
      "‘Sources say that Lammens is coming in as a long-term project for the Red Devils, to provide competition and back up for the number one keeper.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano brought the latest on Lammens on his YouTube channel overnight, the transfer expert said: “Manchester United remain focused on the opportunity to bring in a new goalkeeper before the end of the window.",
      "“The player they want is Senne Lammens at Royal Antwerp. My understanding remains that the player is keen on a move to Manchester United, contacts took place again on Saturday with Manchester United and Antwerp. The two clubs are talking, at the moment, not yet a done deal but advancing.",
      "“The agreement with the player is okay, club to club negotiating. They started at €17 million plus €3m in add ons. Now Antwerp are asking for something close to €25m. So there is negotiations ongoing on the transfer fee and the details of the deal. Conversations are ongoing for Senne Lammens to go to Manchester United.",
      "“Let me explain again, that Lammens to Man United doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is leaving because he remains an important player for United and there are no concrete negotiations taking place. At the moment the situation has not changed.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United face missing out on a top transfer target as a European giant have ‘submitted’ a hijack ‘offer’ at the last-minute.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville reckons Andre Onana could ask to leave the Red Devils with Senne Lammens edging towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd are ‘actively work hard’ to find a new club for their goalkeeper with their fifth summer signing ‘almost done’.",
      "A Man Utd star has been ‘offered’ to Bayern Munich as Romano reveals a top Red Devils target has ‘said yes’ to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim kept coy on a new Man Utd’s hunt for a new goalkeeper but warned the club’s bomb squad it’s on them to secure exits.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly closing in on a return to Serie A, while Manchester United are stepping up efforts to make their next signing."

      "Now watch Newcastle v Liverpool and send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Are Man Utd fans trying to win ‘I was right’ trophy?\nI mean, that the mess at Old Trafford shows no signs of abating is of course tremendously entertaining, but FFS people, it’s two games into the season. Lost to Arsenal after more than matching them (and IMO it was a foul on the keeper), and drew away to a Fulham team that was four places higher and 12 points better off last season. New attack not gelling yet? It doesn’t happen overnight, fellas.",
      "I don’t think Amorim is the right guy, I never have done. I get the Villas Boas vibes too off him, and I believe that he is just another notch on the bedpost of failure at OT, but your board just gave him £200m to spank, and people are calling for his sack two games into the season? Have you lot learned nothing? He has to be given a chance to succeed, or, as is more likely, fail, and to turn your collective backs on him before August is over is insanity.",
      "The ever more deranged Badwolf is going to have a new condition named after him, such is the poor fella’s descent into despair caused by his beloved team’s fall from grace:",
      "“Why’s that man walking so strangely?”",
      "“Poor fella literally doesn’t know his arse from his elbow, worst case of Badwolf syndrome I have ever seen.”",
      "…and countless others are lining up to write the season off and call for the manager’s head and it seems more important to them that they are proven “right” (whatever that really means) than backing the manager, a manager who inherited a disjointed squad going backwards just a few months ago. There are unwritten rules to supporting a team, and the first one is that you, well, support them. Instead, we seem to have a core who seem to revel in slagging off the manager and many of the players, whilst leaving Brexit Jim – who has enough oversight here to be the actual scapegoat that people should be blaming – virtually unscathed.",
      "Yes, it’s probably going to end in tears, but it sounds to me as though the fans lining up to slate Amorim want this to happen at this point, just so they can “win” something. Anything. The “I told you so” trophy?\nMat (modern football fans are rubbish)",
      "",
      "Amorim is done\nNo idea who is next, but the experiment has failed. Don’t string it along, don’t strategically wait, get him gone and move forward. Every other club can do it, United can too.\nRyan, Bermuda (genuinely surprised Amorim failed this badly)",
      "",
      "…Lots of reaction to how bad United were/are.",
      "I’ll add that I think they are in more than a slump. Why?",
      "1. 28 points from the last 29 games",
      "Extract from that what you will.\nCulk the Younger",
      "",
      "Five points on average Man Utd\nFirstly, I had to stop watching the United game yesterday for my own sanity. After the first half, I could see they weren’t going to win the game, and you can just see the confidence and quality of the team is just very low.",
      "Secondly, Fernandes blaming the referee on missing his penalty because it disrupted his ‘routine’ says it all. How he said that with a straight face in the interview is beyond me. Is he being serious? He’s been great at taking pens over the years, but just own up and say you messed up instead of being a child about it. Excuses are already coming out instead of admitting drastic improvements are needed.",
      "Five points I would like to make on this team and Amorim as well",
      "1. How are Shaw, Mount and Casemiro starting matches? Come on, all three of them are physically incompetent, and just not good anymore. Maguire, Heaven or Mazraoui ahead of Shaw please and give Mainoo or Ugarte some minutes given they can actually run.",
      "2. Fernandes can’t play CM, he has to be one of the CAM’s. He doesn’t have the discipline to play in the middle in the 3-4-3 system Amorim desires to play, but actually plays well as a CAM or a number 10.",
      "3. Why is Amad playing wingback? He isn’t a wing back and is a pretty good winger. Seriously just switch it up to 4-3-3 as the formation as well. If this formation doesn’t work, play De Ligt with Yoro as the CB’s, with Mazraoui RB when he is back and Dorgu LB as the starting defenders.",
      "4. No players sold this summer says it all. Sancho, Garnacho and Antony are all getting exactly what they want, Shaw shouldn’t be at the club anymore, Mount is rubbish and I could easily name a few more who need to be on the transfer list. Selling Garnacho is a big mistake. He’s actually a good player, and yes the attitude seems to be a big issue, but find a way of managing him. He can play on the right or left too and actually have some pace and technique to trouble defenders.",
      "5. Our fan base is a laughing stock. We are sounding more deluded than the peak years of AFTV. The amount of people who said in pre-season we are going to challenge for the title or win some trophies this season are just living in another world. Based of what are they saying this! United will be lucky to finish in the top half this season. Yes there is no European football for United this season and will have time to prepare for matches, but I don’t think it will make too much a difference.",
      "Some players are doing the same as they have done to our previous managers, and the tone from the top seems to be even worse than it was when the Glazers were in charge of decisions. Amorim is out of his depth and came to the wrong club, or only came for the same reason so many other players come to United, for a very good remuneration package.",
      "Oh and I’d like to add that Amorim seems to want us to have an unstable keeper. Every time a corner comes into the United box, it’s a complete mess. Coach the team how to defend corners and sign a keeper that can actually catch a bloody football…",
      "Yes it’s two games in, but we have seen it all before with United hyping themselves up and just being utterly shite. Let’s see what Amorim can do, but he needs to first of all try and win two league games in a row, something he hasn’t been able to do since arriving in November last year.\nRami, Dubai (Different year, same arrogant United)",

      "No excuses it’s actually making me hate football and have loved football for 30 years.",
      "I never hear anyone say hey did you see that goal as no one scores any special goals anymore all automated machines.",
      "I miss highly fat players, mavericks and all the waifs and strays.",
      "Caicedo for Chelsea is all that’s wrong people say oh he is the best ! What best at running about never seen him do anything remotely special bang £100 million.",
      "Bring back Le Tissier.\nPaul Fizpatrick",

      "This is a genuine question, not a troll, how does Mustafa, and other United fans feel today? It appears to me that you’re in for another long painful season.\nRob",
      "",
      "Dermot Watch\nNot a lot to report on this week’s Dermot watch, of course he agreed with 80-90% of the on field/VAR decisions and the only ones he didn’t agree with were the blindingly obvious errors, e,g, VDV’s “tackle” on Bobb. He did review Trafford’s handball/assault but never really gave a definitive answer?",
      "There were however a few absolute gems even for Dermot and I again use these as examples of the hilarity that can ensue.",
      "When reviewing the disallowed Brentford goal, Dermot felt that the on field decision stands as there is not enough to say it’s not a foul. He and Jay then compare this to Arsenal’s goal last week and the Saliba foul on Bayinder. Dermot states that “well it is a foul isn’t it”, just one little problem here, seven days ago Dermot declared that it wasn’t a foul and Bayinder needed to be stronger, what chance do we have when the “expert” can’t be consistent.",
      "Secondly, a decision he did actually state was wrong. The foul on the WBA striker, “scythed down” (Dermot’s words) but not given as a penalty. Dermot states that “the referee has to question why the player has gone down, what’s caused that, he’s in possession of the ball, why would he go down?”. Fast forward a couple of minutes and Dermot is in full praise of the referee for “a great spot” as he books the Stoke forward for a dive when attempting to round the goalkeeper. But surely the referee should have awarded the penalty, allowed it to be overturned and then book the player, after all he has to question why the player has gone down, what’s caused that, he’s in possession of the ball, why would he go down? Didn’t take him seven days to change his mind on this one, could it be that the referee actually got it right?",
      "Finally, he states that Adringa correctly escaped punishment as his “slap” was non violent. Jay points out that had the Burnley player theatrically gone down then the referee might have reacted differently. Dermot agrees and says “that’s a completely different decision”, what???? A different decision for the same incident because a player cheats?\nHoward (is he Dave from the Fast Show) Jones"

      "But Frank’s flexibility in devising a gameplan not just to nullify the strengths of such diverse opponents as Paris Saint-Germain, Burnley and Manchester City but to more specifically accentuate the strengths of his own players is what a great many supporters wanted more often from the previous regime.",
      "There should always be a certain philosophy and style at the heart of it, the same principles which run through and define whatever team the manager picks. Frank outlined his in that memorable Monday Night Football segment two years ago focusing on how he would set Brentford up to face Manchester City away.",
      "The idea behind his appointment centred around transposing that to a higher level with better players. Curse Daniel Levy for he might have nailed it.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nWhat a difference a week makes. Keith Andrews said Brentford “produced a performance that was us” against Aston Villa, having lamented how the Bees were “a little nice” and “naive” in the defeat to Nottingham Forest.",
      "Those were not adjectives which have often been associated with Brentford since their promotion, even if a sort of identity crisis was understandable after a summer of immense change.",
      "Brentford won far more of their duels – especially in their own defensive third – and it provided a greater base from which they could build. Their goal was a beautiful and basic – a long kick from the keeper and flick-on – and they weathered the storm for over an hour to protect that deserved lead.",
      "Even the disallowed goal lashed in by Mikkel Damsgaard from a long Michael Kayode throw which left Emi Martinez prone was stirring proof that you can raid individuals, but you cannot kill an idea so easily.",
      "The one shot Brentford had from the 28th minute had a better xG than 13 of the 16 Villa mustered in that same time. Perhaps home comforts offered a timely reminder of what they do best.",
      "",
      "Chelsea without Cole Palmer\nHaving failed to score in the three previous Premier League games Cole Palmer did not start, Chelsea needed that.",
      "Their talisman’s durability meant that sequence stretched all the way back to December 2023 but proof of strength and variation beyond the main attacking cog in their machine was overdue with or without him on the pitch.",
      "Enzo Maresca “didn’t want to take the risk” with Palmer and the fact he didn’t feel he had to was encouraging. This might even afford the England international the break his sustained form has long suggested he needs.",
      "Five different scorers stepped up to assume responsibility; it was a far cry from when Mauricio Pochettino implored his squad to “show this is Chelsea Football Club, not Cole Palmer Football Club” before a 5-0 defeat to Arsenal in April 2024.",
      "And there is a story to be told in Chelsea’s prior five-goal Premier League win, when they also recovered from the concession of an early goal to thrash Southampton away last December. The five different scorers that day were Palmer, Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Noni Madueke and Jadon Sancho.",
      "It has come at ludicrous expense but this is a team transformed and quickly maturing.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThe perfect riposte to the wider noise surrounding the opening weekend. Another clean sheet against a relegation-battling United was this time supplemented by a show of proper attacking force Arsenal have not exerted for what feels like an age.",
      "It had all the hallmarks of what is likely to become their trademark brand of victories alongside scrappy 1-0s this season: set-piece goals, a penalty, some Viktor Gyokeres fun and even a couple of celebration-tempering injuries in attack.",
      "After beating Manchester City 5-1 at the Emirates in February, Arsenal scored more than two goals in just one of their next 15 Premier League games – away at Ipswich in April. This sort of thrashing has become their calling card under Mikel Arteta and entirely justifies those 90-minute grinds.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nThe argument with Wolves was won long ago; not a single soul still believes Bournemouth might have made a mistake over Gary O’Neil.",
      "But the trade-up for Andoni Iraola continues to prove masterful. His coaching has safeguarded against a level of squad upheaval few can match. Only Chelsea have accrued more in transfer fees than Bournemouth this summer yet the Cherries remain a clear and established force.",
      "The majority of those sales were made at the back, with the ageless Adam Smith accounting for more than two-thirds of the combined Premier League career appearances made by the starting defence and goalkeeper which did not struggle to keep a clean sheet.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the only other side to pick the exact same starting line-up across the first two games, yet just Arsenal and Manchester City have used more players than Bournemouth.",
      "Iraola spoke after the game of his improved depth and “options” for good reason; it’s a quietly excellent squad being maximised by a brilliant manager.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker\nThere will need to be imminent evidence that Burnley can make this work against teams they haven’t just been promoted alongside, especially away from home.",
      "But there is also plenty to be said for the momentum and confidence which can be extracted from that sort of victory. The moods at Burnley and Sunderland could not have been more disparate after their mirrored opening-day results and the Clarets redressed the balance in 90 accomplished minutes.",
      "Parker has also now nudged ahead of Mick McCarthy in terms of Premier League points per game. It truly was a weekend Sunderland might never recover from.",
      "",
      "Marco Silva\nWhile he would quite like some new signings – and is far from alone in that regard – Silva continues to create problems for himself by perennially finding solutions.",
      "One third of Fulham’s Premier League goals since the start of last season have been scored by substitutes. After two games they have already salvaged a couple of points with equalisers from the bench. It’s a neat trick.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOliver Glasner did offer a much brighter outlook on Crystal Palace’s future and how “everybody is working really hard to get the right players in”. There is a strong sense that once the window closes he will be thrilled to be able to just coach without all the nonsense surrounding it.",
      "But Palace really should spend this next week stopping him talking to either Austrian TV or Gary Cotterill. Nothing good can come of it.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nShould be replaced by the man in the opposite dug-out but also retains the full and unwavering support of the fans. Much like his predecessor actually; working for Evangelos Marinakis does seem inadvisable.",
      "",
      "Leeds\nDidn’t lose 6-0.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nThe cycle continues. Without significant change at the highest level beyond the loss of their Premier League status, it always will.",
      "West Ham have appointed a coach shorn of tactical identity and charisma, backed them haphazardly at best in the transfer market – it is difficult to think of a worse, more systematically self-destructive window from an established top-flight club – and reportedly given them a game-based ultimatum to figure things out.",
      "There is no smoke without fire and the internal rejection of those stories only intensifies the feeling that this is an irrevocably broken club.",
      "Potter is not good enough to make sense of any of it, but then it is difficult to fathom who else might. The shortlist to replace him will obviously include Rafael Benitez as it always does, a perfect illustration of a club stuck in the mid-2000s and refusing to modernise.",
      "It is a diabolical squad put together with the conflicting ideas of about five different individuals from at least two managerial regimes, a club which generates money in spite of itself and spends it atrociously.",
      "The Declan Rice windfall is a prime example. It should have been used to reinforce their position as a mid-table side with designs on challenging the elite. They signed Edson Alvarez (loaned out), Mohammed Kudus (sold), Konstantinos Mavropanos (an unused substitute twice this season) and James Ward-Prowse (part of the worst midfield in the league).",
      "The 2003 West Ham vintage is still held as the archetypal forewarning of a side being Too Good To Go Down. The 2025 edition really doesn’t look close to being good enough to stay up.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe PSR argument does sort of fall in on itself with results and performances like that. These first two games must prompt a great deal more introspection at Aston Villa than has been allowed to take place so far.",
      "It was a horribly undercooked bench and even little old Brentford were able to prove the advantages of having an expensive Premier League-ready signing available; that is the sort of asset Villa in many ways cannot afford.",
      "But there must be better in-house solutions than using John McGinn as an out-and-out winger, using Emiliano Buendia at all or persisting with a system which doesn’t appear to work.",
      "Villa put in 27 crosses, a vaguely impressive feat considering their starting line-up was an affront to width and pace, and a figure they surpassed just three times last season. Only four of them found a teammate yet nothing fundamentally changed in Villa’s approach until Donyell Malen came on to offer some thrust in the final half an hour.",
      "Having almost twice as many shots as Brentford but the same amount on target is ultimately as wasteful as their utterly absurd wage-to-revenue ratio.",
      "",
      "Manchester City\nBetween the bungled deployment of the Pep Lijnders high line and Thomas Frank thanking “awfully clever” Jurgen Klopp for inventing the aggressive high press, it was not the first Manchester City defeat which could be traced back to Liverpool.",
      "But that was a chastening reminder that spending more than £300m in a year does not immediately fix every problem. This is a new team with fresh coaching ideas which will take time to implement and master.",
      "While Pep Guardiola knows he will be afforded that patience based on what he was allowed to survive and come through last season, there remains an uncertainty surrounding Manchester City which has rarely been present under his rule.",
      "And it doesn’t feel like their continued curious pursuit of another keeper to completely undermine their initial succession plan will help decide which of the two teams we’ve seen in the opening weeks is a more accurate reflection of Guardiola’s latest expensive rebuild.",
      "",
      "Vitor Pereira\nThere is sympathy for a manager trying to establish and uphold standards at the highest level.",
      "The coach is privy to information and context that supporters and outsiders are not and if Pereira felt Andre was a necessary sacrifice to that altar based on his commitment and approach to training, with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde granted his place, then those are the choices he is paid handsomely to make.",
      "As Pereira said, game time is not a “gift” and has to be earned.",
      "But this is also not anything close to a squad which can afford to make such statements. It is a confused mess of profiles, nationalities, ages and positions and Andre is likely the best of them, as underlined by the Brazilian’s half-time rescue call after his replacement’s decisive mistake.",
      "Wolves were ultimately better for his presence, even with 10 men. But they look every bit a side which has sold its best forward and defender and spent a fraction of the income speculating to accumulate precious little. You’d struggle to name most of that starting line-up even with a team sheet in front of you.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim\n“We prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal,” said Amorim last week.",
      "He must have known it had to be backed up with victories against Fulham and Burnley before the first international break at the very least, with strong performances a preferred accompaniment.",
      "But the burden of that apparent proof is collapsing in on itself. Amorim has managed 25 Premier League games against sides currently in the division, winning just four and losing 15. It is a farcical record considering the backing he has received and the support he still benefits from.",
      "Maybe signing the league’s two biggest xG overperformers does not fix the attack. Maybe Manchester United should derive a modicum of shame in how freely and publicly their opponents discuss their tactical shortcomings. Maybe Manchester United shouldn’t have built around a player who has no clear role and who can’t take a penalty properly after being nudged a minute beforehand.",
      "And maybe Amorim really isn’t the one to fix this. It is worrying that Manchester United do not appear to have contemplated that possibility for one second, so many of their cracked eggs have they already placed in his basket.",

      "Brighton\n“With our younger players a little bit older, Fabian a year in the Premier League, we are hoping for more next season,” said Tony Bloom this summer.",
      "More of the same is not what was planned. Brighton have gamed the system and mastered the market but still cannot consistently crack the code in terms of goals.",
      "Their top scorers last season all scored 10 each and one – their outright top scorer the campaign before – has been sold. For all their brilliance, the only player to ever score more than 10 goals in a Premier League season for Brighton remains Glenn Murray.",
      "That seems unlikely to change this year. Brighton continue to create at as quick a rate as they waste. Danny Welbeck is a wonderful player but never the fulcrum around which an entire attack should revolve, never mind at 34.",
      "And their defence is still unreliable: only three current Premier League clubs have conceded more goals than the Seagulls since Hurzeler’s appointment.",
      "Bloom sanctioned the biggest spend of any top-flight club last season to improve Brighton in the present and that has trickled over into a summer of recruitment in 2025 focused more on the future.",
      "It means £50m worth of teenage Greek strikers remain on the sidelines as Hurzeler does not deem them ready, but the coach has been given a hand his bosses feel is strong enough to be played properly now. The results he is producing suggest otherwise.",

      "Sunderland\nA necessary reality check after that euphoric opening win and fantasy summer transfer window.",
      "The objective at Sunderland remains survival, even if some supporters should dare to dream of Europe and beyond. An injury to Dan Ballard or being forced to have more of the ball would not bring everything crashing down quite so dramatically if the foundations were sound.",
      "These results will happen and often depend on the sort of chance Eliezer Mayenda spurned in the opening stages. Sunderland might be grateful that the one common theme from their first two games is a need not to overreact.",
      "Newcastle were as good as Liverpool were bad, but Anthony Gordon and Rio Ngumoha combined to deny us all some Alexander Isak justice…",

      "And things have not started much better this season with an opening day defeat to Arsenal, while they were held to a 1-1 draw against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "That has left many fans and former players unimpressed with Man Utd spending around £200m on new players over the summer transfer window so far.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt, as well as the new signings, Rooney feels that Amorim can now have “no excuses” for falling below the minimum requirements this season.",
      "Rooney said on his BBC Sport podcast: “There’s no excuses now for the manager this season. He’s got to start getting results and getting the results quickly because once you start getting into October, November, if the results don’t change drastically then that’s when the pressure comes.”",

      "“I don’t think Ruben Amorim would probably say that himself with what we’ve seen since he’s been at the club.",
      "“But I think the recruitment has been good in the summer. I still want to see two or three more players. But it’s difficult to say ‘this is going to be our manager for the next five years’ on what we’ve seen.”",
      "Rooney added: “We might be going to quick on this because Manchester United brings a lot more attention, it’s only two games into the season. But the worrying sign is that we’re seeing things that we saw last season and that’s a concern.”",
      "Former Man Utd team-mate Gary Neville has “checked” his pre-season optimism after a disappointing start to the season and has urged the club to sign a new midfielder.",
      "Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast: “[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up.",

      "“I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it’s quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "“He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he’s fourth-choice really.",

      "20) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nJackson has been available all summer but £80million was said to be the price, which is obviously mental for a one-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly want rid of. It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days.

Reports say City have joined the race to sign the Palace captain, though a move hinges on the futures of Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji. Even if those two leave, Pep Guardiola still has Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Abdukodir Khusanov, while Vitor Reis is out on loan. It’s a World Cup year, so Guehi could prefer to run out his contract in south London.",

Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",

Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider.

United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable.

      "We have ranked them by how p*ssed off they will be after consecutive snubs.",
      "",
      "7) Dario Essugo (Chelsea)\nSigned for a decent fee this summer, Essugo has yet to see a single Premier League minute. The 20-year-old has been left to watch Chelsea’s draw with Crystal Palace and demolition of West Ham from the bench, and must already be fearing the same fate as Lesley Ugochukwu, Carney Chukwuemeka and the rest of the youngsters hoarded at Stamford Bridge before being loaned out and eventually sold.",
      "And we all know the script by now. Say it together: one, two, three…Strasbourg!",
      "",
      "6) Ilkay Gundogan (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola put Gundogan’s omission from Saturday’s squad against Spurs down to rotation, a week after the German sat on the bench while City – and his replacement Tijjani Reijnders – ran riot at Molineux. Journalist Nico Schira claims Gundogan is no longer in Guardiola’s plans, but that’s already obvious after just two weeks of 2025/26.",
      "After seven glittering years at the Etihad, Gundogan left for Barcelona on a free transfer. He impressed in Spain and was re-signed by City a year later, a move we deemed perfect for everyone involved. It turns out we were wrong. For the first and only time ever.",
      "A year on, and back-to-back Premier League snubs suggest a third transfer in as many summers. Gundogan should be more disappointed than angry about the situation: his second City stint looks set to end with him on the fringes, a far cry from 2023 when Guardiola worked tirelessly to convince him to stay. Age catches up with us all, fella…",
      "",
      "5) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nAn unused substitute against Wolves and available but ignored against Spurs, Akanji looks destined for the exit. City have agreed a fee with Galatasaray for the Swiss defender, though personal terms are still to be settled.",
      "The decision is a curious one. Akanji has been versatile and reliable, while Nathan Ake’s fitness record is far shakier, but City seem intent on cashing in while Gala’s interest is strong. Guardiola’s squad is bloated and trimming it is a priority, and Akanji appears to be collateral.",
      "At 30, he’s weighing up his options, but the way this is unfolding would test anyone’s patience. A move to Turkey feels increasingly inevitable, whether it’s his preferred choice or not.",
      "",
      "4) Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United)\nHaving spent every minute of 2025/26 getting splinters on his bum, Zirkzee hasn’t been called upon once by Ruben Amorim. This is despite Amorim chasing an equaliser against Arsenal on matchday one and a winner at Fulham on matchday two. His goal record in England is far from spectacular, but the Portuguese head coach baffled everyone by turning to centre-backs Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in the 87th minute at Craven Cottage with the score level, while Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo were Right There.",
      "But Zirkzee’s situation is different to Mainoo’s. He hasn’t done enough to prove himself as a top-level player for United, and the big-money arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were always going to push him down the pecking order. The one small consolation is that he hasn’t been cast aside entirely like poor Rasmus Hojlund. But two sunny Sundays on the bench already feel less like rotation and more like a gentle nudge towards the exit door.",
      "",
      "3) Ederson (Manchester City)\n“My future is here. Some friends send me a lot of news but 99 per cent is fake news. I understand, but there’s a lot of fake news around my name. My head is staying at the club. It stays with the City. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well.”",
      "That was Ederson in June. At the time we said it might not be down to him, and it’s panning out that way. Despite his public declaration, the Brazilian goalkeeper – like Manuel Akanji – is a target for Galatasaray. City seem happy to move him on, leaving him out of the squad entirely for the trip to Wolves amid the speculation before plonking him on the bench for Saturday’s defeat to Spurs. A James Trafford error, Ederson camera pan was inevitable.",
      "Trafford has moved ahead of him in Guardiola’s pecking order, and if Ederson goes, the door opens for PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma. It’s a brutal situation for City’s long-time No.1, whose future suddenly hinges not on his own form or loyalty, but on the availability of a superstar replacement.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nIt’s Groundhog Day for Kiwior, who has started a second successive campaign on the fringes. Left out completely for the Gunners’ opener at Old Trafford, the defender was an unused substitute against Leeds United on Saturday. Last August, Kiwior didn’t make the squad on matchday one and then sat on the bench for another three matches before finally starting in the Premier League on December 4.",
      "There is genuine transfer interest in Kiwior, and a sale would make sense. FC Porto are keen, but Arsenal are right to hold firm for a decent fee. Andrea Berta has the tough task of rebuilding the club’s reputation in the market, and securing good value for Kiwior would be a step in the right direction.",
      "Plenty of Arsenal fans would be content for him to stay – he played an important role in the second half of last season when Gabriel Magalhaes was injured. But the early signs suggest history is repeating itself. With Gabriel first choice, and Riccardo Calafiori and new arrival Cristhian Mosquera also in Mikel Arteta’s squad, opportunities will be limited. A move to Porto looks increasingly likely, and at this stage, Kiwior would be wise to give it serious thought if he wants to play regularly.",
      "",
      "Playing academy graduates is a cheat code for building a connection with supporters, and Mainoo is one of the best to come through at Old Trafford in years. He broke into an equally dysfunctional United side under Erik ten Hag at just 18 and showed incredible maturity and quality to establish himself in the first team. He’s a top talent, and if Amorim can’t find a role for him, that’s on him.",
      "The England international ought to be exasperated watching Manuel Ugarte struggle while Amorim turns to the Uruguayan and defenders Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven as substitutes ahead of him.",
      "That only fuels uncertainty about Mainoo’s long-term future. He remains one of United’s best, most consistent players – even off the back of a difficult season – and is not someone they can afford to lose, even if a sale would be a pure-profit goldmine. Mainoo might love the club to death, but players will always do what’s best for their career. We’re only two games deep, but fans are already annoyed, and you can only imagine how young Kobbie is feeling.",
      "Newcastle were as good as Liverpool were bad, but Anthony Gordon and Rio Ngumoha combined to deny us all some Alexander Isak justice…",
      "Everton should know better over Jack Grealish, while Thomas Frank and Brentford are both thriving. But West Ham and Ruben Amorim look utterly hopeless.",
      "Arsenal are plotting another Spurs hijack, and a new club are in the race for Marc Guehi, while Manchester United close in on a goalkeeper signing.",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Even a truly rotten West Ham are better than Manchester United have been under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been told to put his ‘damned ego aside’ and sell Bruno Fernandes as Man Utd’s latest failure dominates."

      "Ex-Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay has called Rasmus Hojlund in order to persuade his former team-mate to join him at Napoli, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils had a poor season in the Premier League in 2024/25 with Ruben Amorim failing to improve on Erik ten Hag’s work the year before.",
      "Amorim could only guide Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League with just four teams scoring fewer goals than the Red Devils.",
      "Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee came in for lots of criticism during the campaign and now the former is set to move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "The Denmark international arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth a reported £72m in 2023 but his first two seasons at the club have not gone to plan.",
      "Hojlund managed ten Premier League goals in his first season, seen as a good springboard for him to use going forward, but his tally of just four in 2024/25 has meant Man Utd are looking to offload him.",
      "READ: Amorim wastes Arsenal goodwill immediately as Manchester United sacrifice everything for nothing",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s arrival has knocked Hojlund down the pecking order and transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed last week that the Denmark international wants to ‘feel total confidence’ in his next move amid interest from Napoli, RB Leipzig and AC Milan.",
      "Romano wrote on X: “Rasmus Højlund and his camp have made clear to Napoli, RB Leipzig, AC Milan and all clubs interested that he prefers loan with obligation to buy.",
      "“Højlund always wanted to stay at Man United…",
      "“…but if he has to leave, want move to be guaranteed to feel total confidence.”",
      "And now Italian publication Corriere dello Sport claims that former Man Utd midfielder McTominay has ‘called’ Hojlund ‘to convince him to accept a buy-out option’.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is ‘looking to pull off the final transfer deal, and the Dane is getting ever closer’ with ‘McTominay’s phone call likely a decisive step toward a definitive yes for the former Atalanta player’.",
      "Hojlund is ‘pushing for a permanent deal or a loan with an obligation to buy’ with the report adding: ‘Manchester United has estimated this option at approximately €40 million plus €5 million for the loan. The salary issue remains to be resolved, with a gap still to be filled. Tomorrow could be a crucial day.’",
      "Italian football pundit Robert Donadoni reckons Hojlund would perform well back in Serie A, he told Gazzetta dello Sport: “Every striker has important characteristics, but many don’t take into account how important the team’s work is to a striker’s performance.",
      "“Hojlund seems to me to be the classic player who finishes off his teammates’ moves, with well-defined characteristics. He’s not the type to create chances himself, perhaps by setting off on his own and dribbling past opponents.”",
      "Donadoni added: “He’s a young centre-forward who’s already had a taste of Serie A, and that’s a good thing.”",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes has received a ‘completely disproportionate offer’ to leave Manchester United for the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly closing in on a return to Serie A, while Manchester United are stepping up efforts to make their next signing.",
      "Forced to watch from the stands at the weekend, Rasmus Hojlund has come around to the idea of leaving Manchester United this summer.",
      "Romano has revealed Napoli have made ‘direct contact’ with Man Utd following the injury to Lukaku as a Serie A double deal is on the cards.",
      "According to reports, Rasmus Hojlund is ‘close’ to leaving Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed a significant update on Jadon Sancho."

      "Bruno Fernandes ballooned a penalty into orbit, Leny Yoro’s header was redirected into the net by a Fulham striker, and then Emile Smith Rowe immediately equalised before United could even finish celebrating. Fulham finished with 52% possession, more shots, and looked like the side with the better plan. United, meanwhile, managed just three efforts on target, their only real chance crafted by goalkeeper Altay Bayindir of all people. If the creative spark is coming from the guy in gloves, you know something’s gone badly wrong.",
      "And here’s the kicker: after spending north of £200m this summer on top of last season’s 15th-place humiliation, Amorim has run out of excuses faster than Fernandes ran out of composure from the spot. This was supposed to be the reboot; instead, United already sit 16th after two matches with no wins.",

How can they ignore how badly Amorim did last season? It was absolutely horrendous. I just don’t possibly see how anything changes. He will not deliver at United. 29 games and 28 points is just not acceptable.",

The players will down tools soon enough and they will have another manager. The next manager will banish some players and show discipline like every other manager has done. They will sell the players for peanuts and buy some of his own players for 300m and then he will fail and repeat the cycle. It’s an absolute mess and so predictable.",
      "They will obviously do better this season than they did last season. It’s not possible to do so badly again. They have better players up front but their midfield, defenders and goalkeeper are not good. I laughed yesterday when I seen a United fan in the mailbox suggest if they beat Fulham they will win the league. Neville backing them to come 4th too is hilarious.",

He averaged 15 touches per game in the final 3rd. Obviously not interested in the passing/control part of the game. People said that City’s influence in games would suffer that season. They won the league and champions league.",

Too many times especially in the first half against Leeds, I was shouting at the TV, just give him the ball! Yes, our control will suffer and we will lose possession more often but we will score more. That’s certainly not a bad thing.\nDamola, AFC Berlin",

I’m always careful to criticise managers because at the end of the day they know more than I do but gosh, this is bad. The problem with signing a front 3 that cannot defend is exactly what you’re seeing. You only need to play vertically and through the lines to absolutely batter Manu. No pressure on the ball. Why is this manager so obsessed with 3-4-3? Appointed in November 2024 and still hasn’t cracked 30 points? How can a midfield pivot of Bruno and Casemiro ever work?",

      "16=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "15) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "9=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "9=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "9=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "9=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "9=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "5=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "The Manchester United midfielder remained on the bench throughout their 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday while Diogo Dalot, Benjamin Sesko, Manuel Ugarte, Ayden Heaven and Harry Maguire were all called upon to turn the game around.",
      "As we said elsewhere, Ruben Amorim wasted Arsenal goodwill immediately as Manchester United sacrificed everything for nothing.",
      "Amorim was obviously asked why he had not used Mainoo in either of his team’s first two matches – the narrow defeat at home to Arsenal or the away draw with Fulham.",
      "“No, he is fighting for the position now with Bruno (Fernandes),” said Amorim, giving Mainoo the impossible task of replacing his captain.",
      "“And I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal. And then when I change it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder.",
      "“So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.”",
      "The problem with that situation is obvious: Amorim is never going to take off Fernandes, even when he can see he is struggling.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham and Amorim admitted after the game: “I think he is not used to missing penalties. He knows the importance that this moment can have [and make a] huge impact on the team.",
      "“During the game he was not happy because he was not involved and he has so much responsibility and I think he thought missing the penalty was huge for us.”",
      "And yet Mainoo still did not come off the bench to replace Mainoo, suggesting he is not “fighting” hard enough in training.",
      "Former Manchester United player, pundit and tireless self-promoter Rio Ferdinand has his own theory about Mainoo being sidelined.",
      "He said on his own YouTube channel: “I think he’s the type of player, I think he’s got the talent to build around, but you’ve got to have the team functioning and playing in a particular way.",
      "“I had a debate – there are some players who need the system to be able to perform. There’s some great players we’ve got in this country right now, I’ll go through a few of them, I think Kobbie Mainoo needs a system to play in.",

      "MORE: Amorim wastes Arsenal goodwill immediately as Manchester United sacrifice everything for nothing",
      "He said: “I think we can do better but we are putting in the effort. That is the most important thing for me. In some moments we did well, especially at the beginning of the game, and I felt that after the goal we were thinking about just the result.",

      "“We were working until the goal, we score, and we should do the opposite – have more possession, push the opponent more – and I think we were not smart enough in that moment.",
      "“In this moment we need to think about the performance. Of course I’m not crazy, I know what is feeling of being a player in a team that has to win every match, and I don’t feel a lack of urgency in this moment.",

      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Ruben Amorim would struggle to get Journey on board at this rate.",
      "There was a kickback against the general positive slant given to what was ultimately a 17th defeat in 43 matches as Manchester United manager for the Portuguese last week. But in most quarters the praise was tempered.",
      "It was good and could have been better but was also not indicative of the barometer against which this coach and team ought to be judged.",
      "A home opener against an Arsenal side not yet up to speed was almost the ideal game. It brought low pressure to match expectation levels which have dropped through the actual floor based on last season. A halfway decent performance was always going to be painted in a bright light rather than dull, depressing greys.",
      "The reaction was somewhat driven by the narrative on both sides: it is more interesting for Manchester United to be better this campaign; it is funnier for Arsenal to miss out on the title again. Only one of those possibilities has lasted the week.",
      "Manchester United cannot be trusted. Nor Amorim, who has been furnished with a £200m summer spend amid redundancies and claims of imminent bankruptcy to achieve an arguable slight uptick in performances despite also being granted the silver bullet of a pre-season.",
      "And that absolutely does carry relevance in the face of these results. The increasingly absurd, cruel decisions made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been justified all along as a necessary and unavoidable part of delivering Manchester United back to where they supposedly should be. If that process fails, what was it all really for?",
      "Nothing has really changed. Manchester United still start games well, still have moments of genuine ingenuity and cohesion going forward, still concede thoroughly preventable goals through a series of individual and collective mistakes in the middle and at the back, and still end with Harry Maguire as their chosen desperate route to goal.",
      "And when almost that entire £200m spend has been reserved for completely remodelling the attack, at least two of those enduring traits going back at least to last season and arguably well beyond are close to unforgivable.",
      "Matheus Cunha was electric before quickly becoming static, his three shots and single pass leading to a shot all coming in the first 15 minutes. Bryan Mbeumo did an awful lot of running for little reward. Some moves were slick, with speed of thought, flicks, a crispness in execution and technique.",

      "Each new player was sacrificed to a system which doesn’t appear to work, subsumed by the flow of the game rather than dictating it. Manchester United’s changes were timid and Fulham’s were brave – although they had to be as they were chasing the game – and the performances reflected that.",
      "Manchester United are stuck. They have yielded so much to Amorim in serving his specific philosophy and publicly ostracising and depreciating high-value players – hello, unused substitute Kobbie Mainoo – that these results, especially after going deep into the overdraft of goodwill last season, should not be accepted and indeed ought to result in his sacking. Yet they have also gone too far down that road to stop now for fear of having completely wasted their time all along.",
      "It is why the modest improvements will be amplified beyond all meaning while the familiar failings are excused and ignored, at least by those blinded by the past or in a position of power to do anything about it.",
      "But there are precious few signs of actual sustained change. The best Amorim can conjure after being granted a summer reset even he conceded was entirely undeserved is more of the same. He is the anti-Klopp: turning doubters into people who might never believe again.",

      "This summer there’s been a greater than usual number of Premier League managers openly complaining about their club’s inability to get enough transfer business done, even if most have been more sensibly diplomatic about it than Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The Nottingham Forest boss, Everton’s David Moyes, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Newcastle’s Eddie Howe and Fulham’s Marco Silva have all been outspoken about the issue – and the Cottagers make for a particularly interesting case study in the problem now facing a whole fleet of mid-table sides. Even Newcastle, a Champions League side, are struggling with it.",
      "After year upon year of adding to the squad, Fulham have had an uncharacteristically quiet summer transfer window. There’s something almost delightfully Rothmans retro about a Premier League side’s only business being the £500,000 signing of a 34-year-old back-up goalkeeper from Montpellier; their only departures have been a handful of routine free agent releases and loans, mostly to the Championship.",
      "Unlike some clubs, this seems to have nothing to do with Fulham taking a necessarily cautious approach due to the pressure of profit and sustainability rules; their position is reasonably strong compared with some other Premier League clubs.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE ON FOOTBALL365\n👉 Arsenal have a pivotal early-season moment – but is it Gyokeres’ goals or Saka setback?\n👉 Nottingham Forest should steal frustrated Glasner from Crystal Palace to solve ‘spectacular fallout’\n👉 Jack Grealish thrives in Everton spotlight as Brighton do an absolutely massive Brighton",
      "Rather, the issue facing clubs of their stature is one of pure supply and demand.",
      "If you’re newly-promoted and just need upgrades on a Championship squad, or if you have had almost your whole defence poached like Bournemouth, finding players who are an improvement on what you already have is relatively straightforward. If you have wallets and reputations the size of Chelsea’s, Liverpool’s, Manchester City’s, Manchester United’s, Tottenham’s and Arsenal’s, then you can afford to spend very big money on the very best players.",
      "But sides like Fulham are stuck in between. To establish yourself in mid-table security these days, on the whole your recruitment has to be incredibly well-optimised – especially with PSR in effect.",
      "Brentford, Brighton, Bournemouth and Fulham haven’t got where they are over the past few years by just having a flyer on someone they think might be alright – but the huge money available to them compared with even some of the biggest teams in Europe’s other leagues means they have been able to sign players of a standard that would never have been available to them a decade ago.",
      "The thing is that talented footballers are a finite resource – and six year into the TV money reaching truly astronomical levels, those who offer a substantial improvement on what the Premier League’s middle class already have is proving extremely difficult.",
      "Those who would do so are now only affordable to the big boys, or are increasingly leaving the big clubs not to join the mid-table pack, but to ply their trade abroad where they are more likely to find a club that can compete for trophies: Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford, Jarrell Quansah, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, even Tyler bloody Morton. Thankfully for Fulham here, they had an exception to call on: Emile Smith Rowe, who signed from Arsenal last year.",
      "It does not help those clubs’ managers that for the same reasons, you really have to stuff things up big time to find yourself drawn into a relegation battle with the three sides coming up from the Championship.",
      "Chairmen and directors of football are now in a position where playing it safe and looking after their PSR position for the next transfer window is a far more sensible decision than spunking a load of cash on a punt and a hunch – especially when the same problem also affects the clubs immediately around you in the table.",
      "Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing depends on what you want from your football. Those supply problem means those who do manage to find gems at an affordable price will still be at an advantage. But it feels retrospectively inevitable that things would start to settle down at some point, and the Premier League, at least in mid-table, would return to being primarily about which clubs put their existing resources to best use.",
      "For purists who are more interested in tactics, coaching and academy graduates than they are in being able to brag about having won the transfer window on social media, that might not be the worst thing; it makes the football much more about managerial battles of wits rather than who can use Wyscout most effectively.",
      "The good news for those Fulham fans who are frustrated by their lack of transfer movement is that Marco Silva showed last year that he has grown to be a very savvy Premier League manager capable of getting results.",
      "Here, his introduction of Smith Rowe from the bench came at the perfect moment, with Fulham applying increasing pressure in search of an equaliser and just needing that finishing touch in the box. Silva has made those kind of substitutions a specialty: they’ve scored 19 from the bench since the beginning of last season, the most of any top-flight club.",
      "We’re not surprised by that stat at all. Fulham’s push towards the European qualification places last season was built on their shrewd manager making them extremely organised, disciplined and difficult to play against – traits they exhibited again in this game. The only (admittedly glaring) exceptions were in dealing with crosses, such as Calvin Bassey’s bizarre decision to turn into a judoka and hand the visitors a clear-cut penalty that Bruno Fernandes then blasted over the bar, and letting Leny Yoro rise unchallenged at a set piece to force the opener.",
      "But it’s bad news for league table mobility, and the chances of a side like Fulham closing the gap on the long-established wealthy elite are minimal. To do that, they need to upgrade their attacking options from the serviceable-but-not-outstanding players they already have. It certainly would have made the difference here, with Fulham firmly on top after drawing back level but unable to find a winner.",
      "Unfortunately, those kinds of players are the most problematic of all amid that supply and demand issue – two of the best from the middle reaches of the Premier League, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, lined up against Fulham for Manchester United here.",
      "That kind of complaint is nothing new; football has ever been thus. But that’s the problem with being fabulously wealthy: it doesn’t really matter if you’re ranking yourself against your even richer acquaintances.",

      "The 23-year-old has been capped at U21 level for Belgium and has made 64 appearances for Royal Antwerp over the past couple of seasons, making 12 clean sheets.",
      "Lammens is available for an affordable fee as he is only under contract until 2027 aand Romano revealed on Friday that “talks are underway” between Man Utd and Royal Antwerp.",

      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",

      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",
      "\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.",
      "\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.",
      "\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.",
      "\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.",
      "\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",

      "Monday 25 August 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.",
      "In the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.",
      "But Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"",

      "\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"",
      "Bassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.",

      "Referee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.",
      "\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.",
      "\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "Asked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "There was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.",
      "Analysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "Within the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Whether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.",
      "A win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.",
      "A first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.",
      "Their start is a total contrast to the beginnings of last campaign, where a slow start brought Glasner into question. Their recent run represents a growing consistency that is going under the radar.William Bitibiri",
      "To not score a goal from an expected goals figure of 2.46 was quite an achievement by Brighton.",
      "Not since Manchester City created 2.92 at Crystal Palace in March 2022 had a team in the Premier League created such a high xG figure without scoring away from home.",
      "Perhaps the footballing gods were working their magic for Everton on their big day so Brighton didn't really stand a chance but Fabian Hurzeler will be worried about the flakiness of his forwards.",
      "Danny Welbeck was responsible for 1.54 of that expected goals figure, missing from almost under the crossbar with the goal gaping and also from the penalty spot.",
      "Hurzeler will be hoping it was just one of those days at the office rather than anything too deep-rooted.Lewis Jones",
      "Marco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.",
      "Two games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.",
      "Silva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.",
      "\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference. \"We have eight or nine days to correct some things.",
      "\"We have a lot of games and have injuries; in some positions, we are short.\"",
      "Returns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad.",
      "However, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.",
      "They had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.Patrick Rowe",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Bruno Fernandes missed a first-half penalty as Manchester United slipped to a 1-1 draw with Fulham after Emile Smith Rowe cancelled out the visitors’ controversial opener.",
      "United are winless in their first two Premier League matches after being beaten by Arsenal last weekend and failing to hold onto their lead at Craven Cottage, with the pressure already building on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "A Rodrigo Muniz own goal had put them in front just before the hour mark despite United defender Leny Yoro pushing centre-back Calvin Bassey in the back with both hands as he headed a corner in off the Fulham striker.",
      "The incident came after Bassey had been punished in the first half for throwing Mason Mount to the floor at a corner while Man Utd's Luke Shaw bundled over Muniz in the same moment.",
      "The game was stopped one minute and 23 seconds later when the VAR Darren England instructed referee Chris Kavanagh to review the incident, and he awarded a penalty.",
      "Kavanagh was involved further when he accidentally collided with Fernandes as the Man Utd captain was preparing to take the spot kick, which he then smashed over the crossbar, looking to find the top left corner.",
      "Fernandes appeared to be upset with Kavanagh disrupting his pre-penalty routine and said afterwards: \"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not an excuse for missing the penalty.\"",
      "United were left to rue the chances they missed in the first half. Matheus Cunha had three shots within the opening 14 minutes, whistling a strike from distance over, side-footing an effort against the right post and then forcing Bernd Leno into a fine save after brilliantly controlling Altay Bayindir's long pass forward.",
      "But Fulham more than played their part in an entertaining game, forcing the nervy Bayindir into two significant saves before Smith Rowe came off the bench and tapped in Alex Iwobi's cross from close range with less than 20 minutes remaining to deservedly earn a point.",
      "Fulham: Leno (7), Tete (7), Andersen (7), Bassey (6), Castagne (6), Berge (6), Lukic (7), Sessegnon (7), King (6), Iwobi (8), Muniz (7).\n\n\nSubs  Wilson (6), Robinson (6), Smith Rowe (7), Jimenez (6)\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6); Yoro (7), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6); Amad (6), Fernandes (6), Casemiro (6), Dorgu (6); Mbeumo (6), Mount (6), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Dalot (5), Sesko (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a), Maguire (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Alex Iwobi",
      "\"I was upset. As a penalty-taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",
      "\"It's the same as my one. It's a foul. He pushed me to stop me from getting to the ball. When the ref looks back on it, he will be disappointed. I can't say too much before I get a fine!",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He's got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.",
      "On the penalty award for his foul on Mason Mount: \"I still think it's harsh. I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\"",
      "On Bruno Fernandes' penalty miss: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "\"I think we can do better but we are putting the effort, so that is the most important thing for me. I think we did well in some moments, especially at the beginning of the game.",
      "\"After the goal, we were just thinking about the result. This team needs to win games, so we need to focus on the performance and what we need to do, because if we focus on the results, we forget to do the normal things.",
      "\"We were OK until the goal. We scored and we should do the opposite: have more possession, push the opponent more. We were not smart in that moment.\"",
      "Fulham head coach Marco Silva on whether Man Utd's goal should have been disallowed:",
      "\"Perhaps. Difficult to say something. I think you saw the same as myself. All of the world saw what happened here this afternoon in terms of the VAR decisions. I will not say anything more.",
      "\"I don't have the words to explain things that are impossible to explain. They did unbelievably well when they saw the penalty. The foul on Rodrigo (Muniz) was half of a second after the push from Calvin (Bassey). I think they were amazing and we have to congratulate them.\"",
      "\"We are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.",
      "But it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.",
      "Last weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.",
      "This time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess.",
      "Marco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.",
