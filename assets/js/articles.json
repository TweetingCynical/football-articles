      "Roy Keane certainly got a rise out of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp when the Manchester United legend described the Reds' defending as \"sloppy\" back four years ago",
      "Roy Keane has never been one to shy away from saying exactly what he thinks, whether that be on the pitch during his Manchester United days or in the studio as a pundit.",
      "However, that doesn't mean the Irishman is free of consequences. Though Keane is a famed hardman who boasts an intimidating aura, not everyone is afraid of giving it back. Just ask Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who was certainly aggrieved by one of the United legend's one-word digs aimed at the German's Reds side back in 2020.",
      "Speaking in the aftermath of Liverpool's 3-1 victory over Arsenal, Keane claimed that Klopp's team were \"sloppy\" in places despite the win. The Reds boss issued a passionate response, having heard what the Sky Sports pundit had said just before his post-match media.",
      "\"Did I hear right, Mr Keane said we had a sloppy performance tonight? I could hear you already, did he say that?,\" Klopp questioned. \"This was a sloppy performance tonight? I'm not sure if I heard it right. He may be talking about another game because it cannot be this game. Sorry.",
      "\"That's an incredible description of this game, this was absolutely exceptional. Nothing was slopy. Absolutely nothing. From the first second dominant against a team in form, 100 per cent in form. You have to be careful like hell and not get hit by the counter attacks.",
      "\"I think 60/70 per cent of all the balls in behind were offside, you just wait a little bit longer for the flag meanwhile, so that's why it feels not great but it was offside.",
      "\"Ali [Alisson Becker] had to make one save, there were two balls in behind, you can't avoid that, you need a goal in these situations. Apart from that, the football we played was absolutely exceptional tonight. So it doesn't help for any other game. Not for Thursday, not for Sunday. Not for nothing.\"",
      "At the time of Keane's assessment, Liverpool's defence was not at its most resolute. Days before the game against the Gunners, Klopp's side shipped three goals at home against now-Championship outfit Leeds United.",
      "Keane did get the chance to reply to Klopp's passionate disagreement with his analysis, telling the Liverpool manager: \"I think you must have misheard me.",
      "\"I said there were sloppy moments but I think you have been outstanding, I have been giving the club nothing but praise. So I'm not sure you heard me correctly there.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been called up to the England squad and his older brother is now a model and property developer after starring on Love Island",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's rapid rise continued earlier this week after he earned his first England call-up.",
      "The 18-year-old has impressed during his breakthrough season at Manchester United. In fact, the teenager has started in 15 of their last 16 matches despite only making his first Premier League start in November.",
      "Mainoo was initially called up to the England Under 21s squad for the March international break. However, after putting in an excellent performance in United's 4-3 win over Liverpool, Gareth Southgate decided to call Mainoo up to the senior camp ahead of friendlies against Brazil and Belgium this month.",
      "But that is not the only surprise. Fans have been left stunned after discovering that Mainoo has a famous brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, who featured on Love Island and has over 700,000 followers on Instagram. Jordan starred on the fifth season of the reality TV show in 2019.",
      "He entered the Mallorca villa during week three and quickly got into a relationship with Anna Vakili. But the couple soon separated after Jordan explored a connection with new arrival India Reynolds. Jordan and Anna were dumped from the island on Day 52 - less than a week before the end of the show.",
      "Since his time on Love Island, Jordan has been a model for Vogue, Louis Vuitton, JD Sports and other well-known brands. As well as that, Jordan has dipped into the property developing industry and has been buying houses in his home city of Manchester before converting them into high-end family homes.",
      "Speaking to Manchester Evening News last June, Jordan said: \"I looked at all my favourite high-performance celebrities and tried to figure out what the denominator was between them all achieving success over a long period of time. That denominator was multiple businesses.",
      "\" Conor McGregor is a good example. He opened his whiskey business, he’s got McGregor Fast where he does his strength and conditioning. He’s got a pub chain, and what’s he not done for the past three or four years? He hasn’t fought because he’s got all these other businesses that are working hard for him.\"",
      "One fan said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"Wait is jordan hames actually kobbie mainoo's older brother?!\" Another added: \"Sorry how am I just finding out that Kobbie Mainoo's brother is Jordan from Love Island?!\" A third continued: \"Jordan from Love Island is Mainoo's brother???\"",
      "United midfielder Mainoo will be hoping to impress if he is handed his first England cap against Brazil on Saturday or Belgium next Tuesday. The Three Lions are among the favourites to win Euro 2024 this summer, with Southgate's side facing Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia in their group.",

      "They beat rivals Liverpool 4-3 in extra-time last weekend to set up a semi-final clash against Championship side Coventry next month. With all that in mind, here's the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "Harry Maguire wants Gareth Southgate to remain in charge of England beyond Euro 2024, despite Ratcliffe making him his top target to replace Erik ten Hag as United boss this summer.",
      "When asked if he wants Southgate to stay with England, Maguire said: \"Yeah, definitely, obviously.‌ We want to be successful in the Euros – we are not looking at the World Cup at the moment – but obviously, if we are successful at the Euros, which is our main focus, of course, we want to be successful.",

But I feel like what he's done from when he first took over this job to where we are at now, we've taken huge strides and he's a massive part of that.\"",
      "Juventus defender Gleison Bremer has emerged as a transfer target for United, according to reports from Italy. It is claimed that Dan Ashworth, who is close to becoming United's new sporting director has endorsed a move for Bremer. The centre-back is said to have a £43million release clause in his contract.",
      "Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite has also been linked with a summer switch to Old Trafford, having earned England recognition after impressing for the Toffees following a loan spell at Dutch club PSV Eindhoven last season.",

      "And when asked about Eriksen's comments, Hojlund told TV2: \"I myself have sat on the bench for FC Copenhagen, so I know what that means. But he holds his head high and he is a class player. He trains well and is still very positive and very helpful, so it's not a big deal.\"",

      "Manchester United could yet change their manager next season but, after England boss Gareth Southgate spoke out, the Old Trafford bosses may have to look elsewhere",
      "Manchester United could be on the lookout for a new manager next season amid uncertainty over the future of Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman is in the midst of his second season at Old Trafford but has failed to build on a promising opening campaign. The Red Devils face the prospect of missing out on the Champions League and Sir Jim Ratcliffe has now come on board to take control of the footballing operations.",
      "As a result Ten Hag's future remains unclear and Gareth Southgate was earmarked as the club's top target. Since those reports emerged the England boss, whose own future at Wembley is unknown beyond the Euros, has distanced himself from the dugout in Manchester.",
      "He said: “There are two things from my point of view. One is I'm the England manager. I've got one job basically, to try to deliver a European Championship and the second thing is Manchester United have a manager. I think it is always completely disrespectful when there is a manager in place. I don't have any time for that sort of thing.\"",
      "It could leave Ratcliffe and United look elsewhere as they aim to take the club forward and make them consistent challengers once again. The Red Devils have won just one trophy since 2017 but several highly thought of tacticians could be the man to take United back to the top. Here's several options Ratcliffe could consider.",
      "The ex-Chelsea boss was previously linked with the Old Trafford hotseat and will be a man without a job come the summer as he's leaving Bayern Munich. Tuchel has proved he can be competitive in England and whilst in charge of the Blues claimed the Champions League back in 2021.",
      "The only concern for Ratcliffe and co may be Tuchel's relatively short periods in his various jobs - he lasted around two years or less at PSG, Chelsea and Bayern. He has shown himself to be a serial winner however and would demand the respect of the dressing room and bring with him a clear style.",
      "Whilst the Brighton boss continues to be linked with the soon to be vacant Liverpool job United could yet swoop in. It would be something of a risky move given the club, with the exception of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, have employed proven managers over the past decade or so.",
      "David Moyes was the last man who managed a Premier League club outside the top six and was then hired by United - and that lasted less than a year. De Zerbi though is one of the most sought after young managers in Europe and has impressed with the Seagulls, causing major problems for top sides.",
      "Zizou has been out of a job since leaving Real Madrid for a second time and had his eyes on the France national job until recently and will likely have to consider another club role if he's keen on a return to the dugout. His CV is an impressive read having led Los Blancos to a hat-trick of European Cups.",
      "His tactical IQ has by no means been lauded, but Zidane's greatest strength is being able to get the best out of big name players, who want to play for him. Managing the dressing room would be no issue and the French great would no doubt attract big names.",
      "Another of Europe's exciting young managers but, unlike De Zerbi, Amorim has silverware to back-up his talent. The Sporting Lisbon boss just missed out on crossing paths with Bruno Fernandes, but since taking charge in the Portuguese capital he's won two domestic cups and the league once - and could yet make that twice in the coming months.",
      "Sporting are well set with Amorim the only man to consistently upset the duopoly of Porto and Benfica. Amorim was linked with the United hotseat when they eventually opted for Ten Hag but, two years on, he and the Red Devils could see a union that would have serious longevity to it.",

      "England boss Gareth Southgate has been installed as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's favourite to replace Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and he has now given his take on a potential move to Old Trafford",
      "Gareth Southgate has ruled himself out of the running to be Manchester United boss this summer.",
      "Southgate committed himself to the England job and said he would refuse to have discussions with any club until after the Euros. That effectively means that United would have to wait until mid-July to get Southgate who also branded the talk “disrespectful” to Erik ten Hag.",
      "United have made Southgate their No1 target should they axe ten Hag but the England manager’s comments were designed to defuse the issue so he can concentrate leading the nation to glory this summer.",
      "Southgate, talking on the eve of the Wembley friendly with Brazil, said: “I’m certainly not going to speak to anyone else, I never have, I’ve been eight years in the job and would never entertain speaking to anyone else while I’m in a job, so I don’t know if that answers your question.",
      "“My focus is the European Championship. If we did a contract here before then everybody would be saying: ‘Why are you signing a contract before a Euros where you’ve got to prove yourself?’”",
      "Southgate also underlined his commitment to the “manager’s code” in not wanting to go behind ten Hag’s back while the Dutchman is still in a job at Old Trafford. It actually means that Southgate’s best chance of getting the United job would be for them to stick with ten Hag for the start of next season - and then make a change into the campaign.",
      "Southgate added: “There are two things from my point of view. Firstly, I am the England manager and I have got one job, basically, to try and deliver a European championship. Clearly, before that, two important games this week.",
      "“And the second thing is Manchester United have a manager. I think it is always completely disrespectful when there is any speculation about a manager who is in place. I am president of the LMA so I don’t have any time for that sort of thing.”",
      "The Football Association are desperate to get Southgate to sign a new contract beyond his current £3m-a-year deal which expires in December. But Southgate insists that he will put all talks about his future on the back burner until after the Euros, although he may decide he wants another crack at a World Cup but would only quit England for a big club job.",

      "The England job comes with harsh scrutiny, but in terms of global attention United is a worldwide institution where the pressure is unrelenting 24/7 and 52 weeks a year. To my mind, Southgate’s England reign has been positive on the whole - but after three major tournaments on his watch, it has also been a tale of missed opportunities.",
      "And Manchester United aren’t in the market for missed opportunities - they have had a decade of those since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. First things first: Erik ten Hag is still in charge at Old Trafford, and if he goes on to win the FA Cup and finish in the top four, there is a difficult conversation to be had about him staying on.",
      "Whatever happens in future, United fans will always savour the memory of that comeback against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. But Ten Hag knows how football works. There is no smoke without fire, and clearly Southgate has his admirers in co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s football operation.",
      "He is a decent, principled man who would wear the United blazer with pride and distinction. But would he deliver results where they matter most - on the pitch? Southgate has had a golden generation of players at his disposal with England, but so far he has missed the boat when the big prizes were there for the taking.",
      "In 2018, England were 1-0 up against Croatia in a World Cup semi-final but failed to press home their advantage. In the Euro 2020 final against Italy, they were 1-0 up again but lost on penalties - on home soil and against a side who failed to qualify for the next World Cup.",
      "And in Qatar 16 months ago, England were knocked out by France in the quarter-finals despite nullifying Kylian Mbappe. People talk about Harry Kane’s missed penalty, but that was another fantastic opportunity to go on and win a major tournament.",
      "United don’t need a manager who is a master of near-misses. They need a winner. Sure, he would enjoy the support of players like Harry Maguire, to whom he has shown great loyalty at international level.",
      "But is Southgate ruthless enough to build an empire like Fergie or Sir Matt Busby? If he was offered the job, and he took it, he would have to hit the ground running because, in the eyes of some fans, it would be an underwhelming appointment.",
      "I like Gareth Southgate as a person. He is a nice guy - but nice guys in football don’t often bring home the trophies.",

      "Manchester United could benefit from the latest set of Premier League charges with a potential move for Leicester midfielder Kieran Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "The 25-year-old has been a standout performer in the Championship this season with Leicester eyeing an instant return to the top-flight. Enzo Maresca's side were in a commanding position and clear at the summit, but a run of one win across their last five matches has seen the chasing pack close in.",
      "Now, Leicester have been hit with a Premier League charge. It was confirmed on Thursday that the Foxes have been referred to an independent commission for allegedly breaching profit and sustainability regulations. They have also been accused of failing to submit their accounts to the top-flight on time.",
      "The Foxes could face a points deduction at the start of next season if they are promoted and found to have breached regulations. Leicester issued a furious statement saying they are \"surprised\" by the actions and will \"defend itself from any unlawful acts by the football authorities.\"",
      "But Leicester might be forced to sell players, even if they are promoted. This is where United could take advantage as the club are reportedly interested in signing Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "Brighton wanted to sign Dewsbury-Hall in January and supposedly had a £20million bid rejected by Leicester, who were asking for an offer in the region of £45m. If the Foxes are promoted, it's said that they will want around £40m - the same fee Tottenham paid to sign James Maddison last summer.",
      "But should the Foxes stay in the Championship, then the asking price for Dewsbury-Hall could drop to as low as £25m, which could prove to be a bargain. The Shepshed-born midfielder has scored 10 goals and provided 12 assists in 36 Championship appearances this season and has three years left on his contract.",
      "Amid the noise surrounding his future in January, Leicester boss Maresca told The Telegraph that Dewsbury-Hall informed him that he wanted to stay at the King Power Stadium. He said: \"Kiernan came to me when there was all the noise about him and told me that he had no intention of leaving the club.",
      "\"He said he had an obligation to get Leicester promoted. He feels responsible for last season and wants to take the club back to the Premier League. All the other players are the same.

      "Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri is unhappy with how his loan spell at Granada has gone as the La Liga outfit edges closer to relegation.",
      "The Uruguay international, 22, hardly featured during the first half of the season for the Red Devils and, as a result, was the subject of transfer interest in January. United sanctioned a six-month loan move to Granada late in the winter window to allow Pellistri to continue his development.",
      "Unfortunately for the youngster, his time in Spain has been somewhat of a mixed bag. While he has played plenty of football, Granada parted company with manager Alexander Medina this month.",
      "And the outlook is pretty bleak when it comes to relegation, too. Jose Ramon Sandoval has been drafted in to replace Medina, but Granada are second from bottom in La Liga and 13 points from safety as we head into the final weeks of the season.",
      "Speaking to AUF TV, as quoted by ESPN, Pellistri expressed his disappointment with the club's current plight, saying: “At the club we are going through a complicated time, but football is like that, there are good and bad moment and you have to be quick to change the chip and bring good energy here. When I return to the club, we have to continue with the best of energy to achieve our objectives, and try to do our best here.”",
      "He added: “I’m getting a lot of minutes in Granada. I’m happy about that part, but sad about how the level of the group is going, we all want to achieve the objective the objective, there are still chances: as long as those chances are there, we’re going to keep fighting.”",
      "Pellistri's latest comments come months after his agent, Edgardo Lasalvia, took aim at Erik ten Hag. He appeared to suggest that it would be \"difficult\" for his client to continue at Old Trafford if the Dutchman remained in charge as a result of his limited game time.",
      "Lasalvia told Sport 890 earlier this year: “Whether he returns to Manchester in the middle of the year will depend on the performance he shows. If Ten Hag continues, it’s going to be difficult. Ten Hag hasn’t used him, valued him, or treated him like a professional.”",
      "Pellistri adopted a more conservative approach when he was asked about his long-term future earlier this month but also made it clear he would keep his options open heading into the summer. He has featured just 24 times in total for Manchester United since signing for the club from Penarol back in 2020.",

      "Douglas Luiz angered Man United players with his celebration after equalising for Aston Villa and his antics have not yet been forgotten by Alejandro Garnacho and team-mates",
      "Six weeks on, Manchester United's players have still not forgotten Douglas Luiz's celebration in front of goalkeeper Andre Onana and Raphael Varane.",
      "The Brazilian's shimmy after scoring for Aston Villa in the mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league>Premier League game that ended with United earning a late 2-1 win was described as \"disrespectful\" afterwards.",
      "And Alejandro Garnacho was replicating it in front of the cameras during a training session earlier this week in a perceived dig at the Villa star.",
      "In a video posted on social media by United, winger Garnacho, behind coach Darren Fletcher, was seen dropping to his knees at the end of a drill before shaking his shoulders.",
      "And in the background Amad Diallo, the hero of last weekend's FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool, and Willy Kambwala soon copy Garnacho by dropping down to carry out the same celebration.",
      "Varane confronted Douglas Luiz after Scott McTominay's winning goal, celebrating in the Villa player's face in an act of sweet revenge.",
      "And United head coach Erik ten Hag was quizzed on Douglas Luiz's celebration in his post-match press conference. He admitted it may have motivated his players to win the match, saying: \"I don't have an opinion on it.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to the players. It may have fuelled the players. I don't know. We have to think about our game. Not about the opposition. We always want to control the game and dictate it. That should be our approach.\"",
      "Douglas Luiz was also involved in an altercation with Rasmus Hojlund as the Denmark international left the pitch in the final couple of minutes. The United striker, who scored the opening goal, was in no rush to leave the pitch after being substituted and that incensed Douglas Luiz, who went over to grab his opponent and usher him off.",
      "Unai Emery's Villa remain in fourth place, nine points clear of United but with an extra game played. Fifth is likely to be good enough for a Champions League finish this season thanks to England’s high UEFA co-efficient.",
      "But that place is presently occupied by Tottenham Hotspur, with Ten Hag's men six points behind. Garnacho is among those who have remained at United during the international break and they return to action on Saturday, March 30 with a trip to Brentford and a game that kicks off at the uncomfortable time of 8pm.",

      "Michael Hatton, 63, became involved in a bitter feud with his neighbours in the Hollins area of Oldham, Greater Manchester, and daubed the fence with a vile slur",
      "A Manchester City fan daubed a vile slur about the Munich Air Disaster on his neighbours' fence after discovering they were United supporters, a court has heard.",
      "Michael Hatton, 63, got into a bitter argument with his neighbours - a man and his girlfriend - in the Hollins area of Oldham over a wooden fence he had erected between their front gardens, the court was told.",
      "As the dispute heated up, Hatton painted '58' - a cruel reference to the 1958 Munich air crash which claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight members of the United squad - onto the fence. It was also said that he daubed the words 'City rule OK, 'United are s***' and 'f*** off' with paint.",
      "In another incident, when the couple were accused of playing loud music late at night, Hatton, who works as a painter and decorator and lives with his wife, used his electric drill at 5.45am the next morning to attach 27 screws to the fence. He shouted: \"You are going to get this every morning you f****** scum.\"",
      "Tameside Magistrates' Court was told that Hatton was also heard shouting 'sl**' and 'I hope that lady dies' when the couple had their grandchildren over for a visit. In a statement, the male victim, who is currently selling his house, said he and his partner felt like they had been forced to 'live in hell'.",
      "He said: \"Michael has caused us to live in hell for the last four years. We are terrified of it escalating. We have never retaliated. We desperately want to move so that we do not have to live in fear.\", reports the Manchester Evening News.",
      "\"He wrote offensive remarks which obviously put people off purchasing the house. We are worried about the children getting hurt. We feel that this will only end once we have moved. He is fixated on causing us issues and harassing us.\"",
      "The male's partner said: \"I absolutely hate living here because of him. We have been forced to put the house up for sale to move away. He frightens me because of the kids. I tell my family to be vigilant when going out in the dark in case Michael does something.",
      "\"I cannot sit in the garden with my granddaughter. I worry he might throw something over the fence and hurt her. He is violent and aggressive. He genuinely frightens us and makes us feel paranoid. I am constantly checking the garden to see if there is any damage he may have caused overnight. We are living in fear. He has made our life here hell in a short space of time.",
      "Suchitra Goswami, prosecuting, said: \"This is a matter involving a neighbour dispute where the defendant has been harassing the neighbours. This started in 2020.",
      "\"The victims have complained that the neighbour, the defendant, damaged a fence post which separated the garden between the two addresses. One of the victims states that the damage was done deliberately.",
      "\"Before the damage the defendant had installed new fencing on his land. On February 16, the complainant overhears the defendant outside of the rear property saying to another neighbour ‘I hope that lady dies.’",
      "\"She also overhears the defendant calling her daughter a 'sl**'. On May 30, the defendant used his drill in the early hours at 5.45 to 6.45 stating ‘you are going to get this every morning you f*****g scum.’",
      "\"On June 4, approximately 27 screws were found in the fence between the neighbours’ properties. The screws were approximately 1.5 inches long. There was no reason for those to be put there.",
      "\"For another incident on May 20, the complainant states that they returned home to find offensive writing written on the fence, visible on their side of the garden. The defendant is aware that the victims are Manchester United fans where the defendant is a Manchester City fan.",
      "\"On the fence he wrote, ‘City rule OK. United are s*** and f*** off' and ‘58’. He states that the 58 was a reference to the 1958 Munich air disaster involving a number of United players who died. This was prolonged period of causing maximum distress to the victims. They have clearly suffered.\"",
      "The court heard that Hatton has a history of 14 offences, including battery. His lawyer, Mohamed Patel insisted tensions between the neighbours have since 'settled down'. Mr Patel said: \"It is a sad situation. Ordinarily one would expect neighbours to live well together. Initially they were living well together and helping each other out.",
      "\"But the issues began in 2020 when the gentleman found a new relationship with his current partner and relationship between the neighbours got a bit sour. Music started being played a bit loud and that saw the relationship going into a downfall.",
      "\"It is always difficult with neighbour disputes. Each party thinks that they are in the right but he fully accepts responsibility for this offence.",
      "\"While I accept it is an ongoing dispute which goes back to 2020, this offence dates from 2023. There have been no further offences since June 2023, no further reports from either party to police. There have been no further issues. I would submit that things have settled down between the two neighbours.\"",
      "Mr Patel said Hatton was upset because his neighbour took down some old fencing after he put up new posts, and he reacted to their loud music, He explained: \"In relation to the drilling the night before the neighbours were playing loud music and it was a reaction to that.",
      "\"He fully accepts that he should not have done this. There have been no further developments or further issues. I understand that the neighbours’ house has been sold. It is just a matter of time before they move out.\"",
      "Hatton pleaded guilty of causing trouble between Feb 15 and June 4 of last year. He got a six-month community punishment with 15 days of special activities with the probation service.",
      "He also had to pay £100 as fine, as well as £199 in charges. Also, a restraining order for two years was put in place, stopping Hatton from going near his neighbours or stepping onto their property."

      "The semi-finals of the FA Cup are set to take place at Wembley next month and Manchester United's clash with Coventry City has been brought forward due to concerns from the Metropolitan Police.",
      "In the first semi-final, Manchester City will face Chelsea at 5.15pm on Saturday, April 20 before United take on Coventry at 3.30pm the following day. The Football Association (FA) are said to have requested a 4pm kick-off, but they have now agreed to move the match after talks with police.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the match was viewed as 'high-risk' by the police, with the FA and broadcasters said to have been left frustrated about the change as later kick-offs typically mean larger TV audiences.",
      "City are the defending champions, having beaten United 2-1 in the final last year as they completed a historic treble, and Pep Guardiola's side will enter their semi-final against Chelsea as the favourites.",
      "United, meanwhile, will be favourites to win the other semi-final after winning a dramatic quarter-final clash with Liverpool 4-3 in extra-time. Championship side Coventry, however, have the potential to cause an upset after they beat Wolves 3-2 to book their place at Wembley",
      "And Coventry boss Mark Robins, who won the FA Cup as a player with United in 1990, is very much looking forward to facing his former club. \"I honestly think that the teams that are left are just top, top sides, but my preference was United,\" he told Coventry Live.",
      "\"At one point it looked like Liverpool were going to go through but then it just turned on its head. Obviously, I wanted United to win the game and then we got drawn out first and they followed us out, so perfect!",

It's a Wembley trip and it's brilliant for the supporters, the players and the staff and everyone involved, and we can go and have a go at Wembley against a top team with a top manager.",
      "\"They'll be expected to win, 100 per cent, and we want to try and go and give a really good account of ourselves again, and enjoy it. At the end of the day, it's a fantastic achievement just to get to this stage but it's one of those things where you don't want to just go and make up the numbers.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has sympathised with Christian Eriksen after the Manchester United midfielder expressed his frustration over a lack of game time.",
      "Eriksen, 32, has fallen down the pecking order following the emergence of the prodigious Kobbie Mainoo and has been forced to settle for a place on the bench in recent weeks.",
      "The Denmark international has featured for just 37 minutes across United's last seven league matches and was benched again for last weekend's epic FA Cup triumph over Liverpool, appearing only as a late substitute.",
      "The veteran midfielder is currently away on international duty but revealed he has spoken to Erik ten Hag over his concerns, explaining to Tipsbladet: \"I have had a conversation with Erik about being unhappy with the situation and wanting to play as much as possible, but I am available and need to be available for the team, which I am and always will be.",
      "“He said it was the team he had chosen, and Kobbie is doing well and the rest of the midfield is also performing well, so there is competition for places, which is expected when playing for a top club. There is great competition within the team.",
      "While Eriksen has stressed that the current situation is not \"keeping him up at night\", his United team-mate and compatriot, Hojlund, has sent his support to the playmaker.",
      "The 21-year-old striker has drawn on his own experiences, telling TV2: “I myself have sat on the bench for FC Copenhagen, so I know what that means. But he holds his head high and he is a class player. There is absolutely no doubt about that.",
      "“There is no concern at all from me about it. Of course, you want to play football. And I’m sure he does too. [But] he trains well and is still very positive and very helpful, so it’s not a big deal. [Eriksen is] a real professional.\"",
      "Mainoo's emergence has also impacted Casemiro's standing at Old Trafford. Like Eriksen, Casemiro has played significantly less this season, although he's also been plagued by injuries.",
      "It's expected that the veteran midfielder will be one of the players made available for transfer this summer. Mirror Football revealed on Thursday that Wolves' holding midfielder Joao Gomes has been identified by Ineos as a long-term replacement for Casemiro if United can find a buyer for him in the summer transfer window.",

      "It's anticipated that the Red Devils will be busy this summer following several structural changes. Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is now at the helm after acquiring a minority stake in the club and has already made his mark behind the scenes.",
      "It's widely been reported that one of the 71-year-old's most pressing priorities was the appointment of a new sporting director and Ashworth, who has impressed in roles with Newcastle, Brighton and The Football Association, has emerged as a primary target.",
      "He's currently on gardening leave while United attempt to agree a financial package for his services, but summer recruitment plans are starting to take shape in the meantime.",
      "United are keen to bolster their defence in the summer window and Bremer is on the club's radar after impressing at Juventus. While Ashworth will be tasked with overseeing the club's recruitment strategy and will have a deciding say in transfer matters, it's been claimed by reports overseas that he has endorsed Bremer, although this is unconfirmed.",
      "It's previously been reported that Bremer has a £43million release clause in his contract; a sum which is unlikely to be viewed as excessive. Ratcliffe has already expressed a desire to move away from the habit of spending huge amounts of money on ageing players.",
      "Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite is also on United's radar following a string of impressive performances for the Premier League strugglers this term. At just 21 years of age, he fits the profile of perspective signings United want to pursue, although he would likely command an extremely high transfer fee.",

      "Southgate, 53, has transformed the fortunes of the national team since Sam Allardyce's departure almost eight years ago. He has guided the Three Lions to a World Cup semi-final and came within a whisker of glory at Euro 2020, losing the final on penalties.",
      "The Star revealed earlier this week that Ineos, led by new Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have identified Southgate as their No.1 target to replace Erik ten Hag if a managerial change is made this summer. The Dutchman remains under pressure and his long-term future at the club now Ratcliffe and co are in charge of sporting operations is far from certain.",
      "Maguire, who has been in integral part of the England squad under Southgate for years, would surely benefit should he take the top job at Old Trafford - but he's backed the Three Lions chief to stay on beyond Euro 2024.",
      "When he was asked if he wanted Southgate to remain in his post-long-term, Maguire said: \"Yeah, definitely, obviously.‌ We want to be successful in the Euros – we are not looking at the World Cup at the moment – but obviously, if we are successful at the Euros, which is our main focus, of course, we want to be successful.",
      "“If Gareth’s the man to make us be successful then we want him to stay as long as possible. I’ve had a great relationship with him.

      "While Maguire may be keen for Southgate to stay with England, his comments are unlikely to prevent Ratcliffe and Ineos from making a move for their top target.",
      "Southgate's contract with the Football Association expires in December and he has so far refused to entertain discussions over an extension. It's been outlined that prising him away from his current contract would not be an overly expensive process for Manchester United.",
      "Much will hinge on how United end the season, as well as England's performance at Euro 2024. Failure to qualify for next season's Champions League could lead to Ten Hag leaving the club - particularly if Southgate is open to moving on from England.",

      "Manchester United are eyeing England boss Gareth Southgate as their next manager with a replacement for Casemiro also identified at another Premier League club",
      "Manchester United's focus continues to be on what the club will look like from next season.",
      "Erik ten Hag is attempting to land a spot in next season's Champions League and bag a trophy, but whether he'll be in the dugout next season remains to be seen. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already begun bringing in people off the pitch and is potentially drawing up a list of managerial candidates.",
      "United have been unable to build on last season's promise with the team continuing to be inconsistent. Sunday's FA Cup win over Liverpool was a high point of the season as the club continue to plan for the future. Here's the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "Gary Neville and Roy Keane both believe Gareth Southgate would be a solid candidate to become the next United boss as questions continue to hang over the future of Ten Hag.",
      "Ratcliffe could yet opt for a change in the dugout and he's also looking to bring in Dan Ashworth, who has a relationship with Southgate following their time with England. The Three Lions boss is yet to commit to the national team beyond the Euros this summer.",
      "Keane said: \"His connection with Dan Ashworth, who he has worked with previously. Yeah, I’m not that surprised with it (the links).” Neville claimed: \"I never saw Gareth Southgate as a Manchester United manager, psychologically, I never saw that. I can see it now.\"",
      "Keane took a swipe at Sir Alex Ferguson after it was claimed the former United boss used to pull his players out of international duty towards the end of the season. The former skipper has not spoken to Ferguson since he was forced out of Old Trafford in 2005 after a bitter fall-out.",
      "Neville claimed the ex-United boss used to withdraw his players from England friendlies during the title run-in. Responding to Neville's claim, Keane said he would be “ashamed” to tell players they were not allowed to represent their country.",
      "“When I was a manager, and obviously players were getting called up, I’d be ashamed of my life to tell a player that he couldn’t go and play for his country,” he said. “You might say it’s a different challenge at Manchester United, but I still think you’re a manager and when a player gets an international call up, you should be happy for them because it’s a dream.\"",
      "The Red Devils are weighing up a move for Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes – who could make his Brazil debut against England. United are looking to sign a holding midfielder this summer - with Casemiro likely to leave – and have identified £40million-rated Gomes as a potential replacement for his fellow Brazilian.",
      "Gomes has been watched by United on several occasions this season, most recently earlier this month, when Wolves beat Fulham 2-1 at Molineux in the Premier League.",
      "The 23-year-old, signed by Wolves for £12m from Flamengo in January 2023, is expected to be handed his first cap for Brazil against Gareth Southgate's side at Wembley on Saturday. Gomes, a combative central midfielder nicknamed 'The Pitbull' in his homeland, has also attracted interest from United's Premier League rivals Tottenham and Newcastle.",

      "And Maguire insists Mainoo is ready and will have no fear going into the tournament. \"I don't see why not,\" said Maguire. \"To play at a major tournament, obviously, it's big to have experience but also the young boys do come in and sometimes they play with no fear and they can excel in that way.",
      "‌\"I don't have any concerns whatsoever. It's incredible he's (only) 18, he's so mature. He's a bit like Jude was when he was a young boy. He's got a mature head on his shoulders. I had no concerns. I see day in, day out his ability in training. He just wants to work hard and do well. I congratulated him, said he deserved it, keep it up, and make sure he enjoys himself.",
      "‌\"He's got everything, he can handle the ball brilliantly. He's really strong, powerful, and you can see the progression to play that role, especially for Manchester United.",
      "‌\"Listen, we have a lot of good centre-mids in this country at the moment, a lot of players who have been there and done it, and shown that they can do it in the big, major tournaments. He'll keep working hard, I'm sure he will, because he's a great lad. It's exciting times for him and his family. We will see where it goes.\"",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "It would not be the first time that a prodigious talent has broken through ahead of a tournament as Marcus Rashford did the same when he was a teenager at United ahead of the Euros in 2026.",
      "Incredibly, Rashford is now one of the senior figures who, along with Maguire, are trying to help guide Mainoo through and they regard it as a key part of their own responsibilities at Old Trafford.",
      "Maguire said: \"I told him if he needs anything just to ask me, give me a text, about anything, schedule, he thoroughly deserves it. He has been excellent for us this season.‌",
      "\"A role and responsibility for the senior players at Manchester United is to bring through academy players. The club is always built on giving opportunities to young boys, we have numerous of them training with us a lot, we try and make them feel welcome.",
      "\"And that's a big role and responsibility of the senior players, and we have done that to Kobbie. It's important he feels welcome, he feels comfortable, even coming into this group with England it is really important he feels welcome.\"",
      "Maguire admits that United should be in better shape than they currently are and his own season has been disrupted by injuries. But Maguire admitted the \"crazy\" FA Cup tie with Liverpool and the dramatic victory in extra time might be a catalyst to get their season going again, especially with the chance to win silverware.‌",
      "He added: \"It's obviously been a difficult season for us. The points tally in the Premier League is not too bad, but it should be a lot better. The five teams above us have accumulated more, a lot to be honest at this stage of the season.",
      "\"Obviously we've had a lot of injuries, but so have other clubs, to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup was disappointing and the Champions League campaign was also disappointing.",
      "\"We played well in the Champions League Group games, but two red cards have probably cost us from going through there. So to have a good run in the FA Cup is important and it's a huge result for us, to keep that faith that we've still got a chance to go and win something this season.",

      "Ahead of those games, boss Hjulmand has confirmed that an agreement has been reached with the Red Devils to limit Hojlund’s minutes in an effort to avoid any further injuries.

The spell in Spain came after charges against Greenwood of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in February of 2023.",
      "Those at the top of the Getafe hierarchy are reportedly keen on keeping hold of Greenwood for another season but are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase the England international outright. Unfortunately for them, the Red Devils have decided they want a fee for the striker if they are going to part ways, according to The Sun.",

Could he play sincerely for Manchester United well, would we be comfortable with it and would the fans be comfortable with it?\"",

Ratcliffe's preference is to acquire up-and-coming talent rather than blockbuster names and Gomes, who United believe could be available for £40million, fits the bill as a player with significant resale value.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is training with England during the international break and his rise at Man United has been a joy to follow.",
      "When Manchester United and Real Madrid played each other in pre-season last summer, a fan posted photos of Jude Bellingham and Kobbie Mainoo on social media.",
      "The caption read: \"Bellingham and England's best midfielder.\"",
      "The post was intended as a joke, but there's an outside chance that Mainoo could start alongside the Real Madrid star at this summer's European Championship in Germany.",
      "Bellingham and Declan Rice are guaranteed to start and Mainoo would perfectly complement that pair as the No.8, but it would be a remarkable achievement for him to be included in the England squad, never mind to be given a prominent role in the team by Gareth Southgate.",
      "Mainoo has been exceptional for United this season and his performances haven't come as a surprise to those who know him best - they were confident he would succeed.",
      "The MEN exclusively revealed in July that Mainoo was set to be kept around the first team and that preceded him becoming the breakout star of the pre-season tour.",
      "Mainoo was brilliant in friendlies against Lyon, Leeds and Arsenal, and his breakthrough into the team was only delayed by the ankle injury he sustained against Real Madrid.",
      "The club carefully handled his return in October and he made a handful of appearances for the Under-21s to get back up to speed, with the words 'eased back into action' used.",
      "Mainoo's performance against Salford was impressive and the MEN's match report read: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first team.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag played Mainoo in successive away games against Everton, Newcastle and Galatasaray and he performed like someone with over 300 senior appearances.",
      "Mainoo's composure is remarkable and if he was any more laidback, he'd probably be horizontal. That trait struck coaches from an early age and the anecdote from when Mainoo trained with the first team for the first time at Carrington encapsulates his personality.",
      "That's because when Mainoo took part in his first training session with the first team, he nonchalantly told a coach 'it was alright' and that he 'did OK'. It's understood two senior players subsequently told that coach he'd actually made a strong impression and held his own.",
      "That is typical of his character and his family, who have a Ghanaian background, help to keep him grounded. Mainoo has the right people around him and still lives with his mother.",
      "United sources have said they would be surprised if Mainoo ever got ahead of himself and he's been described as a very calm character who takes everything in his stride.",
      "A source also described him as 'a real natural talent with high technical ability' and everyone who knows the player paints a picture of a grounded, likeable young man.",
      "There have been dozens of players to come through United's academy who have gone by the wayside due to mentality concerns, but such doubts have never existed with Mainoo.",
      "He has the required temperament to enjoy a brilliant career, and his ability was identifiable when he was just five years old, as his former coach explained in January 2023.",
      "\"In terms of my time at Cheadle and Gatley, he was definitely a standout player by a mile at that young age,\" Steve Vare, who is still involved with the Stockport club, told the MEN.",
      "\"It was all a bit too easy and I was trying to make it more difficult to test him. His dad asked whether he would be pushed up into some of the teams, a couple of ages ahead of himself.\"",
      "But before joining United's academy aged nine, Mainoo's father, Felix, searched for a team that was good enough to challenge him and somewhere he could play up an age group.",
      "Mainoo joined Failsworth Dynamos and he was coached by Ian Kelly, who also spoke to the MEN last year after the youngster made his United debut against Charlton Athletic.",
      "\"I'd play Kobbie on the wing or in midfield,\" he said. \"The lad I had up front scored most of the goals but Kobbie chipped in a lot. He was quick, so he was really good on the wing.",
      "\"But if you did put him in the middle, he could shoot and move the ball forward. We'd always win the league, we played for cups and we'd win those, we won 'the treble' in his last season.",
      "\"There was one team visit to a tournament in Blackpool when we stayed over and I had a drink with Kobbie's dad, who is a really good bloke. He's a funny guy and we had a real laugh.",
      "\"We won that tournament and beat an academy side in the final. We also went down to Manchester City, a scout wanted us to play their team, and we only got beat by a goal. The scout said we've never had a team that's come here and given them a game.\"",
      "Mainoo went to both United and City's academies when he was a child and in another world, he's just broken into the starting team at the Etihad under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Fortunately for United, Mainoo chose to join their academy and although City have attempted to lure him away when it would have been possible, he's chosen to stay each time.",
      "A report emerged in November suggesting City were planning to make a move for Mainoo, but United were relaxed because their admiration of the player isn't anything new.",
      "Something disastrous would have to happen for Mainoo to defect from red to blue and he's got the potential to be a player United build their midfield around for the next 10 years.",
      "Mainoo has started 11 of United's 12 games across all competitions in 2024 and his Instagram followers practically doubled when he scored the winning goal in the 4-3 win over Wolves.",
      "He conducted his first external media duties after that victory at Molineux Stadium and when he returned to the dressing room, he received a loud ovation from his teammates.",
      "Just a few weeks before that game, Mainoo had been shopping - he enjoys fashion - in Manchester and he modestly remarked that nobody in the city would recognise him.",
      "Although that was unlikely to be true at the time, it's certainly not true now. Mainoo is already adored by United fans and he recently pulled over in his car, despite being at the start of a roundabout, to sign autographs for young fans who had waved him down.",
      "Additionally, he made a heartwarming gesture when inviting a supporter and his son to Old Trafford, following the loss of a family member, whose last game watching United before passing away was against Wolves when he scored the late match-winning goal.",
      "Those small gestures show that Mainoo 'gets it' and it's why he's quickly become a fan favourite. There's no feeling like watching a player from United's academy perform on the biggest stage and he's equally admired among his peers, who have been taken by his talent, at the club.",
      "Casemiro has said United could have 'a top player for years', Bruno Fernandes has said 'he's got so much quality' and Rasmus Hojlund has described him as a 'generational talent'.",
      "A source also told the MEN that Mainoo 'loves to play with Casemiro' because the Brazilian's defensive discipline gives him the licence to take up more advanced positions.",
      "Mainoo's long-term future will lie in the No.8 midfield role and he's enjoyed working alongside the 32-year-old, who has given him advice and pointers during training sessions.",
      "Although the Stockport-born lad signed a long-term contract in February 2023, it's understood initial discussions have taken place over a new deal to reflect his growing importance.",
      "Naturally, he will receive a wage increase if he signs a new deal, but the MEN understands that all parties are relaxed about the situation and there is no rush to accelerate talks, with the player keen to focus on his United performances for the remainder of the season.",
      "The performance-related bonuses in Mainoo's current contract have been triggered, which is why there is no panic from the player's camp to urgently push for a new deal.",
      "Mainoo has made headlines again this week after he was promoted to the senior England squad. He was initially supposed to spend the international break with the Three Lions' Under-21s and his call-up came as a surprise because Gareth Southgate didn't contact him after the Liverpool game.",
      "The surprise made the promotion an even sweeter moment to savour and Mainoo couldn't wipe the smile from his face when speaking to England's in-house media team.",
      "The player had been weighing up his options about whether to represent England or Ghana and he is proud of his family roots, but he's been advised to lean toward the Three Lions.",
      "England are set to play Brazil and Belgium in international friendlies across the next few days and Mainoo receiving a cameo in either game would represent yet another milestone.",
      "Just over 18 months ago, someone close to Mainoo boldly predicted it was a matter of when, not if, he would play for England and that confidence was not misplaced.",
      "Mainoo seems to be the real deal and he's a Red through and through.",

      "Erik ten Hag's side got the better of the Blades earlier this season, winning 2-1 at Bramall Lane in October. Diogo Dalot netted a sumptuous second-half winner after Scott McTominay's opener was wiped out by an Oli McBurnie penalty.",

      "Manchester United and Newcastle have a strange rivalry centred around the biggest transfer snub of the formative Premier League years.",
      "For a Manchester United fan, the response to Alan Shearer's tweet was absolutely delicious. A quote from famous TV gameshow Bullseye saying, \"Look at what you would have won,\" next to an image of Sir Alex Ferguson proudly parading the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies.",
      "There's little wonder it's still a raw subject for Shearer, who still gets asked about it to this day.",
      "“NEVER! I couldn’t stand them then and I can’t stand them now!!!” That was his tweet on the subject of regrets in his career, and whether snubbing United (twice) still rankled.",
      "His first opportunity to make the Old Trafford move came in 1992, with Shearer choosing Blackburn and United choosing Eric Cantona. The latter would swiftly help United win successive league titles and the FA Cup.",
      "But it was in 1996, when football (nearly) came home, that Ferguson would make his biggest play for the striker everybody wanted. Think Harry Kane or Erling Haaland now, Shearer was of that ilk. He would have taken Fergie's United to the next level.",
      "\"I'd actually done a deal as far as Alan Shearer's contract was concerned, we'd come to a settlement,\" said former United chairman Martin Edwards. \"Shearer had been to Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come. The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United, local rivals, both Lancashire clubs.",
      "\"He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him.\"",
      "Everyone knows the next bit. And the public perception wasn't that Blackburn had snatched Shearer from under the nose of United, it was viewed as a snub from Shearer. In reality, it was both.",
      "The fact he chose Newcastle, with whom he would become a club legend but win nothing, was the part that made United fans laugh. And, so the song goes, they signed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer instead.",
      "In more than a decade at the club after joining in the summer of 1996, Solskjaer won six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League in 1999, when his famous toe-poke secured the treble in dramatic style. That year, Newcastle finished 13th in the Premier League and United comfortably saw them off in the FA Cup final, 2-0 victors.",
      "\"Of course, I was tempted to join Manchester United, but I do not regret either decision,\" Shearer insisted recently. \"I had a magical time at Blackburn, winning the league. And I completed my own dream of playing for my home town club of Newcastle. I have memories I will hold forever and a goalscoring record that makes me extremely proud.\"",
      "Ferguson, who was initially incensed that Shearer wasn't convinced to come to Old Trafford — despite giving him assurances that he could have the No.9 shirt (but that he wouldn't be taking penalties, given Cantona's 100 per cent record from the spot) — didn't lose much sleep over it, in the end.",
      "“I thought that if they were the only things worrying him, we would get our man,\" he said. “History will prove whether he was right to pick Newcastle ahead of us.\"",
      "Only Shearer knows, deep down, whether he is truly at peace with his decision. United certainly didn't have many regrets in that period of history, but they weren't used to being snubbed.",
      "So when you hear 'Cheer up Alan Shearer', to the tune of 'Daydream Believer' by the Monkees, or the famous Solskjaer song ring around Old Trafford, just remember this saga and that Ferguson quote in particular. United fans have enjoyed goading Shearer for the best part of two decades. That isn't going to change soon.",

None of them, regardless of the different levels of impact they have each had in M16, are players United fans would have necessarily identified as future signings prior to the 2022 summer transfer window. As a result of Amrabat being overlooked against Liverpool, it once again raises questions about how much control Ten Hag should have over recruitment. The manager, regardless of the club or division, must have a say in the players he will coach, but there is a feeling that Ten Hag's stranglehold on recruitment should be loosened, despite him admitting prior to taking over in 2022 that he wants control when it comes to signings.\"",

      "Man United plan to be active in the forthcoming summer transfer window following the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the end of this season, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future for Manchester United's supporters.",
      "Following the Ineos Group's 27.7 per cent investment in the club last month, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has grand ambitions to make United great again. He has already raided Manchester City for Omar Berrada, wants to appoint Dan Ashworth as the club's inaugural sporting director and dreams of building a brand-new stadium.",
      "On the pitch, he dreams of returning United to their former glories, both domestically and in Europe. For either of those dreams to become a reality, he is going to have to invest in the squad, albeit wisely and sensibly, as he has already pointed out.",
      "United drew up plans for this summer's transfer window as far back as September, pinpointing the key areas they have ambitions of bolstering. It is understood they identified the right-back spot, centre-back, central midfield and attack as areas that will require fresh blood.",
      "United, of course, have spent lavish amounts of money in recent years, but have often been guilty of not spending it wisely. They have encountered more failures than successes in the transfer window since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "Ratcliffe has already hinted at the direction he wishes to take United's recruitment, meaning they are expected to try and discover hidden gems and players with resale value. The Reds have spent big on established players in recent years, such as Raphael Varane and Casemiro, and they are both in danger of leaving M16 this forthcoming summer.",
      "Varane is out of contract and Casemiro could be sold after an underwhelming second season at the club. If they both depart, they are key figures that will need replacing.",
      "Starting in goal, there should not be any need for United to try and sign a first-choice goalkeeper ahead of next season. They swooped for Andre Onana to replace David de Gea last summer and he has improved as the campaign has developed, demonstrating why Erik ten Hag sounded him out as the ideal candidate to replace the Spaniard.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong is on United's radar to strengthen their right-back options, with the position having required fresh blood for some time. However, Diogo Dalot's recent form, provided he maintains it until the end of this season, could see him remain top of the pecking order. He has been one of the most consistent performers in recent months",
      "In the event of Varane departing, he will need to be replaced with a long-term centre-back partner for Lisandro Martinez. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is being monitored and would fit Ratcliffe's criteria, though he is unlikely to be cheap. Despite being left-footed, he is equally capable on his right to play in the right-sided centre-back berth.",
      "Provided he can stay injury-free, Luke Shaw is good enough to remain United's first-choice left-back. However, it would be no surprise to see them consider signing an alternative option.",
      "It is the defensive midfield berth that could require the most intense planning. It is a position that United have not had a long-term operative in for many years, meaning they need to find a player with the potential to make it their own.",
      "As good as Casemiro was last season, he is not a long-term solution. United need a world-class destroyer to operate alongside Kobbie Mainoo, allowing him to strut his stuff without the fear of leaving his team exposed in the middle.",
      "Everton midfielder Amadou Onana is understood to be being monitored by the Reds, while they have been credited with interest in Wolves' João Gomes. Whoever the solution is to United's need for a defensive midfielder, he should operate alongside Bruno Fernandes and Mainoo in the middle.",
      "If it wasn't for Alejandro Garnacho's impressive adaptation to the right-wing, United may have found themselves targeting the addition of a new right-winger as a leading priority ahead of the summer. Jadon Sancho's future at the club remains up in the air and Antony has not been good enough since his arrival from Ajax in September 2022.",
      "Marcus Rashford should keep his place on the left-wing, but could benefit from some suitable competition. Pedro Neto of Wolves has occasionally been linked with a move to M16, but he would almost certainly command too high a fee to be treated as a back-up option.",
      "As for the centre of the attack, there is no doubting United need to add another striker to their ranks, but Rasmus Hojlund should remain their main man. He will only get better.",

      "Manchester United will be looking to upgrade their midfield department this summer with several names linked",
      "As Manchester United approach the end of the 2023/24 season, attention will soon turn towards the summer transfer market.",
      "It promises to be an intriguing period for Erik ten Hag, or his potential replacement, as the Reds look to clear out their squad and head in a different direction on and off the pitch. The recent arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe is set to bolster United's spending power and help attract the right profile of player to go about rebuilding the team.",
      "Joao Gomes and Amadou Onana are two of the names that have been mentioned as possible arrivals in the midfield department, with Leicester City's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall also linked. With that in mind, we have assessed how the trio could assist Kobbie Mainoo and who would best complement the England youngster using data provided by FBref.",
      "From an attacking point of view, Dewsbury-Hall is the player who leads the way in this area after scoring ten times in the Championship this term. By contrast, Gomes and Onana are tied on two each. Mainoo has a solitary strike to his name, which arrived in stunning style in a last-gasp away win at Wolves.",
      "Dewsbury-Hall remains out in front when it comes to shot-creating actions (passes, take-ons, drawing fouls), averaging 5.07 per 90 minutes played. He has, too, made 28 goal-creating actions, and is leading in this category by some distance (Mainoo 4, Gomes 4, Onana 0). The Leicester City star has played more match minutes than Onana, Mainoo and Gomes due to competing in the second tier, though such numbers are nonetheless impressive.",
      "Defensive actions is the area in which Gomes takes control, making nearly double the number of tackles as Dewsbury-Hall (83 vs 42) despite having played 12 fewer league games. The Wolves enforcer is also superior regarding blocks (42) and interceptions (17).",
      "Dewsbury-Hall again excels when in possession of the ball and averages 2.49 take-ons per game, compared to Mainoo's 2.03, Onana's 1.19 and Gomes' 1.49. The Englishman is currently completing 3.93 progressive carries (bringing the ball to the opponent's goal line at least ten yards from its furthest point) of the ball per game and is not even close to being caught by those in this comparison (Mainoo 0.81, Gomes 0.64, Onana 0.97).",
      "While Onana has fallen short in the majority of the aforementioned categories, the Everton midfielder reigns supreme with aerial duals. The Belgian has won 74.6% of his battles in the air, compared to Mainoo's 55.2%, Dewsbury-Hall's 47.9% and Gomes' 48.3%.",
      "Taking the above into account, Dewsbury-Hall could well be the option to consider to provide some attacking threat to support Mainoo's defensive-minded style. Leicester's recent profit and sustainability charge and transfer embargo could result in their star players leaving, providing United with an opportunity to strike a deal.",

      "Man Utd will have decisions to make over a couple of key midfielders this summer and their ideal combination is one signing away from completion.",
      "However the rest of this season pans out for Manchester United, whether it ends in the salvation of the Champions League and an FA Cup triumph, or drifts to disappointment, the most meaningful long-term development might already have taken place. This will forever be remembered as the campaign when Kobbie Mainoo announced himself.",
      "The teenager turns 19 next month but he isn't the future of the Manchester United midfield, he is the present. Mainoo is the main man and he's the player whoever is in charge at Old Trafford should be building the engine room around. He is that good and discussions over a new contract are already under way.",
      "With Mainoo playing as a number eight and Bruno Fernandes just ahead of him, there is the nucleus of an excellent midfield for United. Mason Mount provides high-quality backup, even if the £55million signing would be frustrated at no longer being guaranteed a starting berth.",
      "But the real issue for this summer is who plays the holding role in that trio next season. Since his £70million move from Real Madrid it has been Casemiro, but there are signs that age is catching up with the 32-year-old, who has had a disappointing second season after an outstanding first campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "With Ineos casting a new eye on football operations at the club, it is players like Casemiro who might come under scrutiny. He still has three years left on a deal that makes him one of the highest earners at the club and if this season is evidence of decline setting in then it is time to cut your losses. If any Saudi Pro League clubs show interest this summer then United will surely do business.",
      "There will be more departures in midfield as well. Eintracht Frankfurt already look unlikely to take the option on Donny van de Beek's loan but the Dutchman has no future at Old Trafford, while Christian Eriksen has become a peripheral figure and is frustrated at his lack of game time. Neither player is likely to bring in much of a fee but United should take what they can and clear the salaries off the wage bill.",
      "If Casemiro, Van de Beek and Eriksen do leave then Scott McTominay should stay. As an academy graduate with a relatively high value, there is an attraction to selling him for financial fair play reasons but he is a valuable squad player and a real goal threat and it would weaken United if he was to depart.",
      "There is a decision to be made on loan midfielders this summer as well. United have the chance to make Sofyan Amrabat's loan permanent for £21million. With finances tight and the Fiorentina loanee yet to make much of an impression, it seems sensible to pass over that option and look elsewhere. In the other direction, Hannibal has barely made an impact at Sevilla, but he is likely to attract interest from across Europe this summer and at 21 it is time to cash in.",
      "That would leave McTominay, Mainoo, Mount and Fernandes as options in midfield. Two new additions would be ideal to really provide strength in the centre of the pitch and both should be holding midfielders. United have been linked with a move for Joao Gomes of Wolves and he has impressed in his first season in the Premier League.",

Seven different defenders have played more than 1,000 minutes this term, a number that doesn't include Lisandro Martinez, who will expect to reach that tally if he can remain injury-free between now and the end of May.",
      "Four central defenders have played between 1,274 minutes and 2,010 minutes, but not one of them is in the top seven for playing time this season, which tells a story. Most clubs will have a centre-back towards the top of that list because it is often the most settled area of the team.",
      "William Saliba and Gabriel are top of the minutes played chart at Arsenal. Virgil van Dijk is top for Liverpool and Ruben Dias is fifth for Manchester City, but with 800 more minutes than Raphael Varane, who is United's most-used centre-back.",
      "So deciphering what exactly is Erik ten Hag's first-choice back four isn't easy. It's even more complicated when looking ahead to the summer and the uncertainty that clouds the defence, in the centre especially. The only centre-back guaranteed to remain at the club is Martinez.",
      "Ten Hag has placed some of the blame for United's defensive issues this season on the fact he has had to make so many changes at the back and has struggled to field a settled rearguard.",
      "“We have had to change the defence every time [this season],” he said in January. “If you look at last season, we had a very good back four, very consistent, and we had control. This season, we always have to make adjustments at the back, there are no more automatisms and the middle is too open.”",
      "He will hope that will change next season but what is certain to change is the identity of the players available for selection. Varane might have played more than any other central defender this term, but he is out of contract this summer and is yet to sign a new deal.",
      "The World Cup winner's injury record counts against him, he was dropped by Ten Hag for a chunk of the season and commands a significant wage for a 30-year-old. Ineos might decide it is time to move on.",
      "Victor Lindelof is next on the list and he has performed admirably as a stand-in left-back at times this season. But he turns 30 in July and after seven seasons and more than 250 appearances for the club, it might also be time to move on. The age profile feels telling in defence, with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans also the wrong side of 30. At least two of Varane, Lindelof, Maguire and Evans need to be moved on this summer.",
      "Evans, 36, has played more often than anyone expected and has proved a reliable performer. His deal expires in the summer as well but United could make a late call on the former academy graduate, depending on the incomings and outgoings.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw is the first-choice when fit and although the season has been a write-off for Tyrell Malacia, he will get another season as deputy to try and prove himself. Diogo Dalot has established himself at right-back, but this could be the summer to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He has a year remaining on his contract and there will be interest from mid-table Premier League clubs.",
      "That leaves at least a couple of spaces to fill for United's new-look recruitment department. Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite is top target and the 21-year-old would be an excellent signing. He is comfortable on either foot and on either side of the defence and looks an ideal long-term partner for Martinez.",
      "I would opt to release Varane and sell Lindelof while keeping Maguire as third-choice. He has enjoyed an outstanding renaissance this season and has plenty to offer off the pitch as well as on it. Depending on the budget available, another young centre-back would be ideal, but with financial fair play still a concern it might not be possible. Evans could get another deal while 19-year-old Willy Kambwala looks ready for more regular first-team involvement.",
      "A new right-back would also be required. United have kept tabs on Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong, who has played as a wing-back this season and has an excellent record for attacking returns. If Wan-Bissaka is sold then a replacement to compete with Dalot is essential and that profile should be another front-footed full-back.",

      "The 2024 summer transfer window could mark a series of changes at Man United, in terms of both incomings and outgoings.",
      "Despite still being in the conversations to win the FA Cup and secure Champions League qualification for next season, a lot of attention is already switching to the summer transfer window at Old Trafford.",
      "Following the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Manchester United will be embarking on a new journey come the summer that is hoped will lead to happier and more successful times. Vowing to knock Manchester City and Liverpool \"off their perch\" within three years, the Ineos chief has grand ambitions to make United great again.",
      "He has wasted little time in trying to make a positive impact, swooping for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as the club's new chief executive, from Manchester City. He also wants to appoint Dan Ashworth as the club's inaugural sporting director.",
      "Though Ratcliffe has suggested off-field appointments will initially take priority over player recruitment, there is no denying that this forthcoming summer's transfer window is a vitally important one in United's history. Big changes need to be made to the landscape of the squad, in terms of both incomings and outgoings, regardless of who the manager is.",
      "With that in mind, here is a rundown of what positions United plan to try and strengthen this summer, who has already been linked with filling them, who could leave and what might actually happen.",
      "United, as reported by the Manchester Evening News at the time, drew up plans for the summer window as far back as September. It is understood they have identified four positions they wish to strengthen as a priority: full-back, centre-back, central-midfield and attack.",
      "There is a general understanding that United specifically want to bolster their right-back options and they have expressed interest in Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong. However, there is an increasing belief they could also be in the market for a left-back after the injury issues they have encountered in that department this term.",
      "As for midfield, it has become increasingly clear they need to source a long-term replacement for Casemiro to fill the defensive-midfield role. He has regressed this season and they need fresh legs in that particular area.",
      "Up front, there is no denying United to source a backup option for Rasmus Hojlund. Anthony Martial is set to leave the club at the end of the season, meaning he needs replacing.",
      "As is always the case with United, they have been linked with players by the lorry load in recent months. A new name crops up almost every single day, but some of them you have to take with a pinch of salt.",
      "Nevertheless, there are some players who are understood to be concrete targets ahead of the summer, including Everton duo Jarrad Branthwaite and Amadou Onana, plus Bayer Leverkusen stars Edmond Tapsoba and Frimpong.",
      "It is understood each member of the aforementioned quartet are being monitored. Branthwaite, who was named in the England squad for the first time last week, has also been linked with several other clubs, including Real Madrid.",
      "Other names to have been regularly linked with United recently include Juventus defender Gleison Bremer, highly-rated Benfica midfielder João Neves and Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee. Furthermore, a report by the Mirror on Thursday credited United with interest in Wolves midfielder João Gomes.",
      "Just because United have drawn up a list of positions they want to bolster, it doesn't necessarily mean they will tick every box. Outgoings and the money generated from those sales will dictate what they can and cannot do.",
      "In an ideal world, United should prioritise strengthening at centre-back, in defensive-midfield and in central attack. Signing a right-back may not be as high up on the to-do list, such is the way Diogo Dalot has performed in recent months, as first thought.",
      "There could possibly be a dramatic shift in the landscape of the club's centre-back options. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are out-of-contract at the end of the season, while there are no guarantees Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof will not be sold.",
      "If Varane is not handed a new deal, it is highly plausible that United will make signing a right-sided centre-back one of their leading objectives. Lisandro Martinez is arguably the only member of United's current centre-back pool who is a guaranteed starter.",
      "The addition of a second striker also feels highly necessary, likewise a new defensive-midfielder. Sourcing a player to fill the latter of those two positions has to take initial priority, though the acquisition of a new centre-forward cannot be underplayed.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, United are planning to become more proactive in the seller's market, meaning their could be a record number of sales. There are players in the ranks who are highly unlikely to have futures at the club beyond the end of this season, such as Hannibal Mejbri, Donny van de Beek and Facundo Pellistri, all of whom are currently out on loan. Jadon Sancho's future could depend on Erik ten Hag's while Mason Greenwood could be in a state of limbo, though would represent pure FFP profit should he be sold.",
      "Along with Varane, Evans and Martial, Tom Heaton is also out-of-contract this summer, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Lindelof are out-of-contract in June 2025. Lindelof has regularly been linked with an exit in the last couple of years.",
      "Scott McTominay, despite his contributions this season, is a sellable asset, even more so than he was last summer amid his exploits in front of goal so far this term. He could command a fee that could assist with remaining within the boundaries of the Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "Maguire, too, could also be an attractive signing for several Premier League clubs. He has once again been linked with West Ham United. Marcus Rashford, meanwhile, is understood to be of interest to Paris St Germain and Arsenal, and - like Greenwood - would also give United a monster FFP boost if he was sold. Cashing in on the two of the homegrown players could bring in around £120million.",
      "However, Ten Hag revealed last week that United don't want to sell the forward. \"We did not sign him last season for five years with the intention to sell him now,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"He should be part of this project. So it is not a subject we don't talk about.\"",

      "Man Utd need to balance the books to meet the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules and they will have the chance to do that with two deadlines.",
      "The story of Nottingham Forest's 2023 summer transfer window is laid bare in the independent commission's verdict into their breach of the Premier League's financial rules, which was issued on Monday.",
      "It details the interest in Brennan Johnson and the club's attempts to sell him during the window. From a €50million offer from Atletico Madrid, which was contingent on the La Liga side selling another player, to the £47.5million move which eventually took Johnson to Tottenham, it is all in there, including attempts to drum up interest in the forward by offering him to Manchester United.",
      "The reason Johnson forms such a key part of the 52-page written verdict is because of a date in the calendar that has essentially become a second deadline day. June 30, 2023, was D-day for Forest and it was one they missed. That is why they have been deducted four points.",
      "As key figures at Forest pointed out in evidence submitted to the panel, they knew a player trading profit of around £30millon was required by June 30, 2023, the final day of the financial year, to avoid falling foul of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR). They also knew academy product Johnson was the only player who could deliver that.",
      "This verdict should really be the beginning of the end for PSR as it stands. Making the sale of academy players a shortcut to avoid falling foul of the rules and imposing a deadline at a point when the summer transfer window is yet to get going makes them a sham, but right now there is no sign of change coming.",
      "That makes June 30, 2024, another key date for clubs sailing close to the window and that includes United. The end of the 2023/24 financial year is a key one for the club under these rules because it takes into account the previous three years and it is the point at which a £150million loss from 2021/22 will fall off the monitoring period. Until then, things remain tight, with the £33million loss from last season adding to the problems.",
      "United will be allowed to lose £105million across that period and some of the existing losses can be offset against what the Premier League considers 'healthy' expenditure, such as investment in academies, women's football and infrastructure. Even with that included, they are going to face some challenges to meet it, which could make this forthcoming window one of two deadline days.",
      "Clubs are in regular discussions with the Premier League over their exact position and by the time the transfer window opens earlier in June, United will know where they stand. They will know if they need to make a sale and how much they need to bring in.",
      "The issue that Forest discovered is that the market doesn't tend to swing into life until July and that doing a deal earlier in the window often means selling players for a fee below their optimum value. There is also a greater profit to be had by selling academy graduates, who have no book value remaining so any incoming fee is declared as 'pure profit' in the results.",
      "If the situation gets desperate at Old Trafford then United could be forced to look at an early sale for someone like Scott McTominay. The midfielder was on the market a year ago but has proved to be a valuable squad member this term. Any offer of £35million could prove to be incredibly valuable, however, especially if it arrives before the end of June.",
      "That might be a decision United have little option in, with the decision against Forest another example of the Premier League's strict interpretation of the rules. United are also paying the price for the absence of any European football in the second half of the season, which is putting a major dent in their revenues. However, there is an expectation the financial position around the rules will improve once the loss from 2021/22 drops off the three-year monitoring period.",
      "There will remain challenges for Ineos to confront after that. United continue to post record-breaking revenues that aren't producing profits and a failure to reach the Champions League next season will have a major impact on the summer transfer budget, but it might be a case of trying to sell a player or two before June 30 and focus on the incomings from July onwards.",

      "Manchester United could potentially benefit from the latest Premier League charges with the club linked with summer transfer interest in Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "The Leicester City midfielder has been one of the standout players in the Championship this season with the club fighting at the top of the table. The Foxes did look a sure bet for an immediate return to the top flight, but a stumble over the last few weeks has seen the chasing pack close the gap.",
      "Leicester now also have a Premier League charge hanging over them. It was announced on Thursday evening that the club have been charged by the league for an alleged breach of Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs) and for failing to submit their financial accounts to the top flight.",
      "The charge will now be heard by the independent commission, with a points deduction at the start of next season a possibility if they are promoted and found to have breached regulations. Leicester released a strong statement saying that it’s ‘surprised’ by the actions and will ‘defend itself from any unlawful acts by the football authorities.’",
      "It has previously been reported that Leicester are close to the limit for the period ending this season. They could therefore be forced to sell players, even if promoted.",
      "This is where United could move. According to 90min, the club are showing an interest in Dewsbury-Hall and an ‘initial enquiry’ has been made to the player’s camp.",
      "The midfielder was the subject of interest from Brighton back in the January window, but Leicester are said to have rejected a £20 million bid out of hand with the Foxes asking for a price of £45m.",
      "The report adds that if they are promoted, then Leicester’s asking price in the summer will be £40 million, the same fee that Tottenham paid for James Maddison last summer. However, if they remain in the Championship then the asking price to drop as low as a guaranteed £25 million.",
      "Dewsbury-Hall has played in all but one of Leicester’s 36 Championship games this season, scoring ten times and providing 12 assists. He will have three years remaining on his contract at the King Power Stadium when the summer comes around.",
      "Leicester have previously shown that they will stick to their valuations when it comes to selling players. United know this after dealing with the club when signing Harry Maguire back in 2019, but the Premier League charges hanging over Leicester could help Erik ten Hag's side this time around.",

      "Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag has given five young players their debuts, something which Sir Jim Ratcliffe will appreciate.",
      "Youth. Courage. Success. The three pillars of Manchester United.",
      "United have a rich history of believing in young players and Erik ten Hag's promotion of talent at Ajax was one of the reasons his interview at Old Trafford was a success. During Ten Hag's time in charge of United he's given five players - Charlie McNeill, Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore, Willy Kambwala and Omari Forson - their debuts for the first-team.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was handed his bow by Ralf Rangnick, but he's broken into the first-team under Ten Hag's guidance and the Dutchman been the manager responsible for his impressive development, which has seen the winger make 20 starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "Garnacho is an established first-team player and a huge academy success story. He was signed for a pittance from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2020 and he's proved to be a bargain. The 19-year-old has matured this term and his relocation to the right wing, a position which he'd never played before prior to facing Aston Villa, has gone seamlessly.",
      "There was always a suspicion Garnacho would be as effective on the right and he's made that position his own, starting ahead of £86million purchase Antony. Garnacho was the only outfield player not to be given a single minute on the pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia in Ten Hag's first summer in charge but the Dutchman has been the perfect manager for a youngster who perhaps needed more guidance than others.",
      "Ten Hag deserves huge praise for developing Garnacho and he's overseen the emergence of Mainoo, who has started 11 of United's 12 games in all competitions in 2024. Mainoo is an exceptional prospect and the footage of Ten Hag putting his arm around him after the Carabao Cup final at Wembley has resurfaced over the last few weeks.",
      "The 18-year-old was not involved in the squad, but he was invited to take part in the celebrations and Ten Hag's gesture hinted at his future role. He was subsequently named on the pre-season tour of the United States and was the breakout star of last summer.",
      "Mainoo was superb in those pre-season friendlies and his breakthrough into the first-team this season was only delayed by the ankle injury he sustained against Real Madrid in Texas. The midfielder passed every test after returning from injury - facing Everton, Galatasaray, Newcastle and Liverpool away - and his call-up to the England squad is deserved.",
      "It's likely Mainoo would have broken into the United team regardless of the manager, but Ten Hag has shown trust in him and the player has gone on record with his appreciation. Ten Hag has previously said only the best youth prospects will be given meaningful opportunities, and Garnacho and Mainoo are the most recent academy success stories.",
      "United are closing in on the milestone of the 250th academy player to be given their senior debut and that's a remarkable achievement, although unlikely to be met this season. Forson, Kambwala and Gore were the latest players to receive their debuts. Gore has been sent on loan to Port Vale, while the others have been kept around the first-team squad.",
      "McNeill spent the first half of the season on loan at Stevenage, but was recalled in January and he's spending time with the Under-21s to get back up to speed again. Garnacho, Mainoo, Gore and McNeill all started in the FA Youth Cup final in 2022 and it's been tremendous to see them progress to make their senior debuts at the club.",
      "Ten Hag has fulfilled his remit in that regard and that can only bode well for a decision on his future made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has reiterated the importance of developing young players. His record of giving young talent a chance is something INEOS will appreciate.",

      "The next player from the famed academy to appear for the first-team will be the 250th graduate to have done so, a great achievement by the club. Omari Forson - more on him below - was the 249th when he featured against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup in January.",
      "While another graduate, Kobbie Mainoo, continues to hit the headlines with his England call-up, here's a round-up of the news from the youth set-up.",
      "Lacey set to sign new deal",
      "Last year, Shea Lacey signed a scholarship deal at the club, with an agreement in principle to sign professional terms when he turns 17 and his birthday is now just around the corner.",
      "Lacey's first professional contract will be announced after he celebrates his birthday on April 14, and the deal is the reward for his excellent and continued progression in the youth set-up.",
      "The youngster is regarded as one of the most exciting talents in the academy and while he's been limited to just eight appearances this season due to injury, he's close to a return. It's understood that issue is the first injury of note in Lacey's time in the academy and fans who follow the youth set-up have been eagerly awaiting his comeback.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter.",
      "Forson features for the U21s",
      "When Travis Binnion spoke to the MEN for an exclusive interview in December, he suggested Omari Forson could be the next youngster from the academy to be given his debut.",
      "Forson was handed his senior bow a month later and he's since been given a handful of opportunities by Erik ten Hag, who started him against Fulham in the Premier League. The forward is out of contract at the end of the season and although sources indicated he was expected to sign a new deal, talks stalled and he could leave the club this summer.",
      "United want to keep Forson and Ten Hag has expressed that by giving him first-team appearances. He was on the bench against Liverpool last Sunday and a day later, he started for the Under-21s against West Brom as they comfortably won 3-0 in the Premier League 2.",
      "Having a ball",
      "Also in the team for the Baggies victory was Willy Kambwala, another who had been on the bench for that Old Trafford thriller 24 hours earlier. He had clearly got over his celebrations with matchwinner Amad just 24 hours earlier.",
      "Forson and Kambwala, meanwhile, were recently rewarded for their Premier League debuts. They each received a Debut Ball from the Premier League, to mark their recent top-flight bows.",
      "The ritual, which first happened in 2015/16, sees all homegrown debutants who have been developed at an academy of a club in the English football pyramid for three years or more prior to their 21st birthday receive the memento. United’s director of academy Nick Cox and technical director Darren Fletcher presented the items to the pair at the Carrington training ground.",
      "Who will be the next United recipient?",
      "Gore yet to return from injury",
      "Dan Gore was kept around the first-team squad for the first half of the season and he made his senior debut, but due to the competition in midfield, he was sent on loan in January.",
      "Gore signed for Port Vale on loan for the remainder of the season, however, he sustained an injury immediately after signing and he's been unavailable since.",
      "At the start of the month, sources said Gore, who has stayed at Port Vale during his recovery, should be close to a return to action, but he's yet to return from that injury and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad against Burton Albion this weekend.",
      "The U18s' title charge",
      "The words \"Manchester United are top of the league,\" haven't been heard for a while, but the Under-18s have dominated their division this season and are likely to win the title.",
      "They had a flawless record - no defeats - until losing against Manchester City this month, a result which meant City are now 10 points behind, with two games in hand to play.",
      "Adam Lawrence has done an outstanding job in his first season as U18 boss and everybody connected with the club is hoping the league title will be won come May. The U18s are back in action on April 13 against Stoke City.",

Mainoo has risen above it to run the midfield at times, outshining Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He is proving too difficult to ignore and that was proven on Tuesday when Gareth Southgate promoted him from the Under-21s to the England senior squad. After his performance against Liverpool on Sunday it was clear he was going to have to skip the age group and go straight into the squad for friendlies with Brazil and Belgium at Wembley.",
      "Mainoo will almost certainly make his debut in one of those games, although there is no guarantee yet he will play alongside Rice and Bellingham. These are friendlies, after all. But there is clearly a midfield place up for grabs in Southgate's team and previous incumbents Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips are seeing their grip on it weaken.",
      "Those who have watched him regularly for United this season wouldn't be surprised if Mainoo made that position his own by the time the European Championships begin in Germany in June. A midfield of Rice, Mainoo and Bellingham would be feared across the continent and what's more, they are 25, 18 and 20. This is the present and the future.",
      "If they do line up together, there will be a few staff members around Old Trafford wondering aloud about what might have been. United deserve great credit for nurturing a talent of Mainoo's considerable gifts and Erik ten Hag deserves praise for throwing him in at the deep end this season, but it's not a significant stretch to say they could have had Rice and Bellingham in red as well.",
      "Rice was of regular interest to United during his time at West Ham and in his final couple of years at the London Stadium he was usually the best midfielder on the pitch when the two teams played. But United never quite committed to making their move, despite the obvious need for a player of Rice's gifts.",
      "When he joined Arsenal for £105million this summer it was a transfer battle being conducted by the top two teams in the Premier League at a time when the budget was stretched at Old Trafford, but United had their chance in the years before that. In 2020 they signed Donny van de Beek for £35million, in 2022 they moved for Casemiro for £70millon and last summer it was another £55million on Mount. In hindsight, some of that cash could have been put to better use in making a push for Rice.",
      "Van de Beek has flopped at United and they will be lucky to recoup even a third of the sum spent on signing him for Ajax. Casemiro was excellent last year but has struggled more this season and Ineos could cut their losses and get his wages off the books this summer. The jury remains out on Mount, but Mainoo's emergence has forced him out of the team with no obvious route back in.",
      "But in the list of players to get away from United, Bellingham is at the top. He has lit up La Liga this season and is on the fast track to becoming one of the best footballers in the world. In March 2020, the then 16-year-old was given a tour of Carrington as United rolled out the red carpet to try and sign him from Birmingham City, even drafting in the help of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The sales pitch failed to win over the Bellingham family, with father Mark heavily involved in plotting the next steps of his son's career at that stage. Instead, Bellingham joined Borussia Dortmund and the family will certainly hold no regrets over that call, given the trajectory Bellingham has been on since moving to the Bundesliga.",
      "Regrets will certainly be prevalent at United. A midfield of Rice, Mainoo and Bellingham looks outstanding on paper. By the time the summer is over, we might get to see how good it is on grass as well.",

Mainoo displayed his midfield qualities against one of the favourites for the competition before receiving a standing ovation after being sacrificed after 80 minutes.",

      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Southgate, whose contract with the Football Association runs out in December, has been preparing his side for friendlies against Brazil and Belgium as they continue their warm-up for Euro 2024.",
      "Reports this week emerged saying that the 53-year-old had been made Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s No 1 target to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager, should he decide to sack the Dutchman. Ten Hag has come under increasing pressure after a disappointing season at Old Trafford, one that could still be salvaged by winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "LISTEN: Would you like Southgate at United? Our writers discuss",
      "Even that, however, may not be enough to save Ten Hag. The Manchester Evening Newsreported last month that Ratcliffe and Ineos have been analysing managerial candidates should they decide to dispense with him. And while a decision has yet to be made on Ten Hag’s future, Southgate’s name continues to be in the mix, with the former Middlesbrough manager now the favourite with bookmakers.",
      "That news hasn’t gone down particularly well with United diehards, however. While some recognise the job Southgate has done with the England team in bringing about a massive culture shift, uniting different factions and promoting young players - while reaching the final of the last Euros for the first time in the nation's history - others believe he should have done more with a talented England squad, and believe he has a safety-first approach which wouldn’t suit United.",
      "The MEN conducted our own poll into whether fans would be happy if Southgate was appointed as Ten Hag’s successor, and the results were unanimous. Asked if they’d like to see Southgate as the next United manager, a stunning 93% said no.",
      "It sends a clear message to Ratcliffe, and more importantly Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth. The latter two are big admirers of Southgate, with Ashworth - a former FA employee himself - valuing the long-term job he’s done with the Three Lions set-up.",
      "The dilemma comes from what is clearly a fanbase that doesn’t feel the same way. If United are to make such a seismic change in the summer, they need to get the appointment right. It has to be someone who has the stature and respect needed at such a huge club, someone who can take on Pep Guardiola and whoever comes in at Liverpool, but also someone who the supporters can get behind.",

      "England head coach Gareth Southgate holds plenty of admirers at INEOS as Sir Jim Ratcliffe weighs up Erik ten Hag's future at Man United",
      "England head coach Gareth Southgate has responded to reports linking him with the manager's job at Manchester United.",
      "MEN Sport reported this week that the INEOS founder is an admirer of Southgate after impressing with the Three Lions. The former Middlesbrough boss holds a close friendship with both Sir Dave Brailsford and the incoming director of football Dan Ashworth having worked with both men in the FA set-up.",
      "It is understood Erik ten Hag's future at United is up in the air after a disappointing second season in the Premier League. The Manchester Evening News has reported that Ratcliffe is not 100 per cent sold on keeping the Dutchman beyond this season with Champions League qualification and FA Cup triumph needed to keep him employed.",
      "This week, The Daily Star reported that Southgate has become INEOS' top choice to replace Ten Hag, but the England boss has hit out at the reports. In his pre-match press conference before the international friendly against Brazil at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, Southgate was asked about the links to United.",
      "He responded: \"I think there are two things from my point of view. One is that I am the England manager. I have got one job, basically, to try and deliver a European Championship and clearly before that two important games this week.",
      "\"And the second thing is that Manchester United have a manager and I think it is always completely disrespectful when there is any speculation about a manager who is in place.",
      "\"I am president of the LMA (League Manager’s Association) so I don’t have any time for that sort of thing really.\"",

      "The future of Man United manager Erik ten Hag is uncertain and Gareth Southgate has been linked to replacing him.",
      "Gareth Southgate is the bookmakers' favourite to replace Erik ten Hag at Manchester United.",
      "It doesn't take much money to shift the bookies' manager markets, but Southgate is now their front-runner for the job following a report claiming he is Sir Jim Ratcliffe's priority target.",
      "That hasn't gone down well with the majority of United fans, who don't want to see Southgate manage at Old Trafford after his tenure with England. The 53-year-old hasn't won a trophy in his managerial career and he relegated Middlesbrough in his last club job.",
      "LISTEN: Would you like Southgate at United? Our writers discuss",
      "Ratcliffe has said all the right things since acquiring a minority stake and appointing Southgate would be his most controversial decision yet, so what do our writers think?",
      "They have given their thoughts on the links to Southgate below...",
      "Steven Railston",
      "It seems fans are split on whether Ten Hag should leave at the end of the season, but even those who'd prefer him to part ways would rather he stay over appointing Southgate.",
      "Southgate simply does not have the credentials to manage United and his last experience of club management saw Middlesbrough relegated from the Premier League.",
      "Although he's done an excellent job with England, the demands of international management are different and success in that realm often doesn't translate into club football. Southgate has been perfect for the England job because of his personality. He is a statesmanlike figure, he speaks well on issues in football and wider society and he spent three years as the Three Lions Under-21 manager, so he understood how nuanced the job was.",
      "However, England's squad is stacked with attacking quality and Southgate's approach to games is often pragmatic, overly cautious and defensive, which wouldn't work at United. Southgate is not the right manager to replace Ten Hag. You must win trophies at United and the bottom line is he's never won silverware.",
      "Dom Booth",
      "Southgate isn't a popular name with United fans. There's a general consensus among them that if the club are to replace Ten Hag in the managerial hotseat, they should seek a truly elite name in world football. The problem is, who fits the bill? The really big names are all either occupied in jobs, associated with United's fierce rivals or seem ill-suited to the Old Trafford job. So why not Southgate?",
      "What holds back his case, of course, is his lack of big club experience. Southgate's credentials in the Premier League are thin to say the least. But as a statesman and a figurehead, he ticks all the boxes and you can actually see him galvanising players and getting them to enjoy the responsibility that comes with the United shirt, in the same way that he's made players relish playing for England.",
      "It might be an unpopular opinion, but Southgate could be a decent fit in Ratcliffe's new-look United regime – so long as the club make the right appointments in terms of his support staff. He can handle the pressure of United, he'd get the best out of players but tactically he's more akin to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer than Pep Guardiola.",
      "George Smith",
      "As someone who recently said United should stick with Ten Hag for at least one more season, the prospect of Southgate replacing him is underwhelming. If Ratcliffe does decide to pull the trigger on the Dutchman, Southgate would not be considered an upgrade - and that is not a direct criticism of him.",
      "I am one of Southgate's biggest supporters, constantly finding myself backing him when others have called for him to be sacked as England boss. I think he has done a terrific job on the international stage, resurrecting the country's interest in the national team over the last few years.",
      "However, Southgate is a pragmatic coach, often playing it a little bit too safe. That outlook is unlikely to be welcomed by United supporters, who turn up at Old Trafford expecting to be entertained.",
      "Of course, Southgate has done a good job with England, but international management is very different to managing at club level. Furthermore, the 53-year-old has not managed a club since 2009. All in all, if Ratcliffe does decide to sack Ten Hag and head down a different path, it needs to be made to feel worthwhile. Appointing Southgate would lead to negativity and criticism that can be avoided.",
      "Tom Doyle",
      "There is no doubt that Southgate has done an impressive job with England, but United is a very different beast. Southgate has one of the most talented squads in the game to pick from at England, but that will not be the case at United until Sir Jim Ratcliffe has the club's finances in order.",
      "Southgate has a strong working relationship with Dan Ashworth from their time at the FA and Ashworth is Ratcliffe's No.1 candidate to become United's first sporting director. Ratcliffe's recent comments on United looking for the \"next Mbappe\" rather than signing the PSG superstar himself point towards a more measured approach to transfers for the short-term, with the focus on ensuring the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo flourish - and have like-minded teammates of a similar age profile to build a core around.",
      "Southgate boasts impressive man-management skills and the ability to instil a playing identity in a young group of players, which would align with such an approach.",
      "Still, it is difficult to shake the doubts over Southgate's tactical ability as an in-game coach. His time as England manager is defined by near misses, of what could have been had Southgate decided to twist rather than stick against the likes of Italy, Croatia and France. United is a club in flux, but very much defined by the famous chant from the Stretford End: \"Attack! Attack! Attack!\" Does Southgate have the force of personality and the cast-iron belief to make bold decisions in the heat of the moment?",
      "Southgate may have to win the Euros to convince United fans he has the stomach for a job that has chewed up and spat out the likes of Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal.",

You get built up, built up, built up and then you’ve got to maintain that really high level to stay there otherwise you get shot down pretty quickly.",
      "“There’s cameras everywhere and you only have to look at the previous United players who have played for the country [who were scrutinised]. Beckham had a lot. Even Wayne [Rooney] had a lot of things said [about him] and he was one of the greatest players ever to play for his country.”",

      "McTominay has transformed from a minor player to a key figure, playing a significant role in keeping United's campaign hopes alive. He was once again instrumental in their recent FA Cup victory against Liverpool.",
      "When asked if McTominay's performance for Scotland has influenced his play at Old Trafford, Carver, the assistant coach of Scotland, said: \"Very much so.\"",
      "Carver recalled the match against Spain, where McTominay competed and excelled against Rodri. This experience gave McTominay the confidence to compete at the highest level and has benefited both him and the team, reports the Daily Record.",
      "Carver expressed his delight that McTominay is now playing regularly, which wasn't the case before the European campaign started.",
      "McTominay, who won the title of EE Scotland Player of the Year 2023, is a favourite for Clarke both on and off the field. Carver pointed out: \"You look at some of the players we have in our team who have had unbelievable seasons.",

For the national team he has been outstanding and he got that award.\"",

      "\"He has a presence. He has that little swagger. At the very top clubs you need that because he has to play under pressure every single week.",
      "\"And it's not just pressure from Manchester, it's all around the world. You have to be able to cope with that and he does. And that brings the confidence when he comes into the camp. The guys love him, the staff love him. You tell him to do this and he does it.",

      "As a result of his development, which includes him having won the third-highest number of tackles (83) in the Premier League this season, it is hardly surprising that United are being linked with his signature.

      "Manchester United transfer news as Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is linked with a move to Old Trafford in the summer window",
      "Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a move for Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as Erik ten Hag looks to strengthen his side.",
      "Heading into the first summer with the added investment and input from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team, Gomes is the first new name to be linked with the club.",
      "Ratcliffe is expected to carry out wide-ranging changes at Old Trafford as he continues a thorough process of assessing the performance and methods currently in place. It is said that Gomes, who signed for Wolves in January last year, is someone attracting the attention for the playing squad.",
      "The Mirror write that with Casemiro likely to leave this summer, United are keen to add a new defensive midfielder to their ranks. He has already been watched on 'several occasions' this season including in Wolves' win over Fulham earlier this month.",
      "Gomes, 23, signed for the club for £12million from Flamengo and could get his first cap for Brazil on Saturday. He was called up by Dorival Junior again for the final set of internationals this season. He was also selected 12 months ago in a camp but didn't play.",
      "So who is Gomes, and why might United think that his £40million price tag is value for money?",
      "Gomes is a Brazilian midfielder that came through the ranks at Flamengo. He played 117 times for their senior side before moving to England in the winter of 2023, scoring just three times and assisting four. He has already matched the goals tally at Molineux in just 39 games.",
      "He is set to comfortably play the most football in a single season this year for Wolves and is closing in on 1,900 league minutes. Compared with the current United squad only Diogo Dalot, Bruno Fernandes and Andre Onana can match that.",
      "He had a successful time in South America with Flamengo, winning the Brazilian league in 2020 as well as the domestic cup in 2022, Super Cup in 2021 and Copa Libertadores as well. After joining Wolves last year he played 11 league matches, starting just seven, and failed to score.",
      "He got his first assist for the club in his second game in a 2-1 away win over Southampton. This year he has been a regular in Gary O'Neil's side though, starting 22 of the 24 matches he has played in.",
      "His first goals came like London buses as he starred in a 2-1 win against Tottenham in February. He has also been part of impressive displays as Wolves beat Manchester City earlier this campaign and also Chelsea in both December and January. He was only a late sub as the Red Devils won 4-3 in the Midlands.",
      "He was reportedly a target for United back in 2022 when Liverpool were also said to be in the race to snap him up.",
      "With United struggling to balance in midfield due to Casemiro's injury issues and drop-off in form, Gomes is being looked at as part of a possible new generation. With Kobbie Mainoo developing, Sofyan Amrabat struggling to have the desired impact, Mason Mount absent for most of the campaign, and Scott McTominay more of an attacking player, Gomes would be used as a deeper option.",
      "He is a tenacious ball-winner for Wolves, often operating in a midfield partnership in a 3-4-3 or 4-2-3-1 shape. Such is his impressive tackling, only Fulham's £100million man Joao Palhinha and Sheffield United's Vinicius Souza have made more tackles.",
      "Gomes averages 3.5 tackles per90 this season and has 5.5 ball recoveries per game. Casemiro has 3.3 tackles per90 and 4.9 recoveries per game, for comparison. Mainoo is a different type of player and excels on the ball just as much as off it.",
      "In that sense, Gomes is certainly more of a defensive player that offers balance and control, but he will also need a partner alongside him. Although he showed box-crashing abilities against Spurs a short while ago, he has not proven himself to be that type of player consistently.",
      "Gomes fits into the type of transfer that Ratcliffe hinted at United looking towards under his stewardship. “I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,” he said recently.",
      "“It’s not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Bellingham or next Roy Keane.”",
      "Whilst it's too soon to say that Gomes will be on that level, it certainly indicates that United are looking into different markets for their players. He is also nicknamed the Pitbull back in Brazil - and that's just pretty cool.",

Such competition at the top end of the division was hard to stomach for some Arsenal fans who began to turn on Arsene Wenger after his targets shifted from winning the Premier League to merely qualifying for Europe.",

      "Former West Bromwich Albion striker Shane Long has given an insight into what it is like to work as a player under Dan Ashworth, outlining the one quality that Manchester United will crave in the transfer window.",
      "The sporting director is currently on gardening leave at Newcastle United after expressing his desire to leave and join the Red Devils. He was targeted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and ineos following their takeover at Old Trafford.",
      "An agreement will need to be reached with Newcastle over a compensation package for Ashworth to complete a move. If that isn’t struck, then the Red Devils face a wait of over a year until the end of his contract at St James’ Park.",
      "His first foray into being a sporting director came at West Bromwich Albion after being promoted from academy manager in 2007. During his time in the role, the Baggies were promoted to the Premier League twice and established themselves in the league before he left to join the FA in 2013.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Ladbrokes Fanzone, Long has outlined the relationship he had with Ashworth as player. He also highlighted how key the appointment could be in the transfer window, given his eye for a player.",
      "“Dan Ashworth spent a lot of time around the training ground at West Brom. He was always talking to the players, and giving us the confidence we might have needed at the time,” he said. “You know, I suppose if a player is doing well, it looks good on him, and so it made sense for him to be around. But he was always a really nice guy to be around; he just wanted people to do well and succeed.",
      "“He just had this great eye for a player; he could spot potential in someone just like that, and he always seemed to know what to tweak to get the best out of someone. It's no coincidence he was a success at West Brom, then moved on to Brighton and signed the players he did, and why he's now at Newcastle, and why Manchester United are looking to bring him in. The reason he's respected so much in the game is because he's constantly improving things.",
      "“He's a really good guy to have around the place; I've no doubt he'd fit in at any football club. Wherever he goes now, it's fully deserved.”",
      "Long did however share some reservations over a problem that Ashworth may face should he complete his move to United. “It's an interesting move for him, though, to work with these top, top teams,” he added.",
      "“I think it would be more accepted at a club like West Brom or Brighton, where you can spend £8-10 million on a player and maybe it doesn't quite work out. Whereas, if you go to Man United, you know, I don't think you can get away with buying unproven talent, unless you're just going down the route of getting young, 17/18-year-olds in and bringing them into the club that way. But their fans want the best players in the world, already at the top of their game, so it's definitely going to be a harder role for him.”",
      "“But Dan's an experienced guy who probably knows every player in the game. He's well-rehearsed in what he's doing, and he's had great experience working at the top, because he's with a team who are looking to challenge on all fronts over the next few years. And the main reason they're going to be able to do that is because of depth in their squad, and that's something Dan would play a huge part in.”",

      "“When you look at Manchester United’s game against Liverpool in the FA Cup, so they’ve got a chance to maybe win the FA Cup, they’re going to have to go some to get into the top four. But for them to be talking about it now – it’s a bit off-key, bringing up Gareth now like that,\" he said.",
      "\"But the fact is, is that if he doesn’t win the FA Cup, Ten Hag, and he doesn’t get into the top four, then you can probably have that conversation. But he looks like he might do something. Whatever we think he might do in the future, he might do something.",
      "\"You see Gareth and yeah, stand-up guy, you can see how it could be, but you shouldn’t be talking about him now, it’s out of order.",
      "“You know what’s strange about it, is when you listen to Sir Jim Ratcliffe talk, how he admires Arsenal’s patience with Mikel Arteta, which obviously the FA Cup gave him even more time.",
      "\"It gave me the impression that Sir Jim is going to give Erik ten Hag time. It feels like that because if you are talking about Arteta and patience, and he’s quite admirable about the way he is speaking about it.",
      "“I see Gareth Southgate standing on the line and the way he will be dressed, and his demeanour. I could see him; he’s got the stature to be Manchester United manager.”",

      "Manchester United have emerged as a potential destination for Wolverhampton Wanderers' star Joao Gomes as Sir Jim Ratcliffe start to plan for the club's future",
      "Manchester United have already started looking at possible options for Casemiro who could depart the club in the summer, and Joao Gomes has emerged as a potential replacement.",
      "The 32-year-old has had a disappointing season so far, which has been hit by injuries along the way. Casemiro was sidelined for two-and-a-half months earlier in the season with a hamstring problem and has withdrawn from the Brazil squad with a muscular injury.",
      "Despite still having two years left on his contract with an option for a further year, he could move on at the end of the season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and is keen to continue transforming United's football hierarchy, having already made a number of changes behind the scenes.",
      "The latest name to be linked with an on-pitch move to Old Trafford is the Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder. Gomes has been in fine form this campaign and received a call-up to the Brazil squad for this week's international break.",
      "MEN Sport takes a look at what the Brazilian media have said about the link...",
      "Manchester United are prepared to pay £40m to complete the transfer of Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Joao Gomes.",
      "A club that could benefit from a transfer is Flamengo. The Rio based club which formed the midfielder is entitled to a 10 percent fee if a sale was to happen. In addition to that, the Cariocas are also entitled to FIFA's solidarity mechanism for being Gomes' first club.",
      "Having been at the club since the age of eight, Flamengo would pocked another four percent (£1.6m) if a sale materialised. Therefore a £40m transfer would generate more than R$35 million for Flamengo.",
      "At the highest point in his career, Joao Gomes is wanted by Manchester United who are willing to pay £40m for the player.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United are preparing a proposal for the midfielder ahead of the summer transfer window. United have sent scouts to watch Gomes in action this season.",
      "Flamengo on the other hand, would be entitled to a 10 percent fee if a transfer was to materialise. If United pay £40m for Gomes, the Brazilian club would receive a fee of R$25.3m (£4m), having already cashed in on R$94m (£15m) from his transfer to Wolves.",
      "Manchester United could soon, count on another Brazilian in their squad. The Red Devils have set sights on midfielder Joao Gomes who has been outstanding for Wolves this season.",
      "Erik ten Hag plans to sign a midfielder in the next transfer window and should Casemiro depart, Joao Gomes has emerged as an 'ideal substitute' for the Brazilian. Having come through at Flamengo, Gomes completed the move to the Premier League for £15million and he is currently valued at around £40m.",
      "This season, Gomes has played 28 games, scoring two goals and providing one assist.",
      "Defensive midfielder Joao Gomes, who came through Flamengo and currently at Wolverhampton Wanderers is in Manchester United's sights for the next transfer window. He is seen as the ideal substitute for compatriot Casemiro who may leave England this summer.",
      "Wolverhampton's number 8 is the third player with the most tackles in the Premier League on 83, as well as 131 ball recoveries and 139 duels won. In addition, he has contributed with two goals and an assist.",
      "His displays have led him to catch the eye at Old Trafford as United look for a replacement to Casemiro. The latter has seen his season hampered by injuries.",
      "According to recent reports, Wolverhampton Wanderers are in advanced negotiations to sell Joao Gomes to Manchester United for an estimated value of R$253m (£40m).",
      "This possible transfer puts Flamengo in a favourable position as the Rio club holds a 10 per cent right to a future sale. Gomes, aroused the interest of major European clubs with United now emerging as one of the main teams interested in his signature.",
      "The percentage belonging to Flamengo highlights the importance of contractual rights and financial management behind the scenes in football. Flamengo could reap the rewards of their investment in youth talents.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes after recent comments from Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "Manchester United’s reported interest in Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes would perfectly fit the transfer model that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has outlined for the club.",
      "United have been transforming their footballing hierarchy since the Ineos group purchased their minority stake at the end of last year. The Reds have appointed Omar Berrada as CEO and are interested in appointing Newcastle United’s sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is currently on gardening leave.",
      "It is a necessary overhaul for one of the world’s largest clubs after more than a decade of relative underachievement. While there has been plenty of fanfare around Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival at the club, it appears that fans will have to become accustomed to a different type of player arriving in the transfer market.",
      "A report from the Mirror has stated that United are ‘weighing up’ a move for Wolves’ defensive midfielder Joao Gomes. The 23-year-old was signed from Flamengo in January 2023 and is claimed to be valued at £40m by the West Midlands club. Gomes’ performances for Gary O’Neil’s side have earned him a call-up to the Brazil squad and he could make his senior debut against England on Saturday.",
      "When asked about the possibility of signing Kylian Mbappe as a free agent, Ratcliffe gave a clear idea of United’s preferred recruitment strategy: “I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,” he said. “It’s not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Bellingham or next Roy Keane.”",
      "The report adds that scouts from United have watched Gomes on several occasions this season. What Gomes’ performances have shown is that he's a young defensive midfielder with a promising profile and potential to be a pivotal player. He has recorded the third-most tackles in the Premier League, as well as scoring a match-winning brace against Tottenham Hotspur in February,",
      "Nicknamed ‘The Pitbull’, his style is typified by his work rate and desire to win possession. For United, he would represent a perfect fit for United’s new approach to the transfer market and a stark contrast to a signing that the club made just two years ago.",
      "Gomes’ rise to the Brazil squad has come at a time when Casemiro has regressed from his standout first season at Old Trafford. The 32-year-old was signed for £70m in 2022, viewed as a player who could immediately help catapult United into title contention, alongside his former Real Madrid teammates Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo. It was an expensive quick fix, done without long-term thinking, and one hasn't entirely paid off.",
      "United have been plagued with issues in midfield throughout this season, with the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo helping to offset some of those concerns. The addition of Gomes could help Mainoo harness his more box-to-box and attack-minded tendencies while forming a long-term partnership in midfield.",
      "Waiting for Gomes to further prove himself at Wolves would only allow his transfer value to increase. United’s reported interest in the midfielder could be one of the first hints of how Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants the Reds to operate in the transfer market.",

      "Erik ten Hag has had a tough season at Man Utd but he has picked up some positive results of late and could yet secure a third season in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "England manager Gareth Southgate is in the frame to take over at Manchester United this summer if Ineos decide to part ways with Erik ten Hag, but no decision has yet been taken on the future of the under-pressure Dutch boss.",
      "Southgate has admirers within Ineos, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe impressed with the work he has done with England, while the Three Lions boss also has relationships with Sir Dave Brailsford and incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth. The 53-year-old has featured prominently in discussions over managerial targets this summer, should the new football structure in place at Old Trafford cut ties with Ten Hag.",
      "But any route to appointing Southgate would be difficult. He is tied up with England until the end of the European Championship in Germany, with the final taking place on July 14. Southgate is unlikely to consider destabilising the build-up to the tournament when England have such a strong chance of winning their first major trophy since 1966 this summer.",
      "That would require Ineos to wait until mid-July for a decision, which they may not be willing to do. With Ashworth coming in as sporting director and Omar Berrada as chief executive, they will want the structure confirmed as early as possible this summer.",
      "There would also potentially be a backlash from supporters if Ineos firmed up their admiration for Southgate, with the idea of appointing someone who hasn't managed a club side suffering Premier League relegation with Middlesbrough in 2009 not going down well with supporters.",
      "Graham Potter also has admirers within Ineos and worked for Ashworth at Brighton. As an out-of-work manager, he could be a cheaper alternative as well if United are balancing their financial fair play restrictions, while they are also keeping tabs on Roberto De Zerbi, who replaced Potter at the Amex Stadium but has plenty of interest from clubs at home and abroad this summer.",
      "A lot will depend on how Ten Hag finishes the season, however, with no decision made on his future. He has a year remaining on his contract and has had a difficult second season at Old Trafford.",
      "But Sunday's thrilling 4-3 win against Liverpool breathed fresh life into the campaign and it was a clear indication the players are still playing for their manager. It was a weekend that also increased the chances of Ten Hag engineering a successful end to the season, which could guarantee him the start of next season.",
      "United face Championship side Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final next month and saw Tottenham and Aston Villa drop points at the weekend, which boosted their chances of salvaging Champions League football for next season. United have won eight of their last 10 games in all competitions.",
      "Even if the campaign ends successfully, there may be friction behind the scenes. Ineos are overhauling the footballing department at Old Trafford, with Ashworth heading up a new structure. Ten Hag has insisted that he needs to retain a degree of control over recruitment, which he has previously said is a non-negotiable point for him. United plan to bring in a recruitment head to report into Ashworth, who will himself report to Berrada.",

      "Man United have been linked with signing Wolves midfielder João Gomes ahead of next season.",
      "Manchester United have been credited with interest in Wolves midfielder João Gomes ahead of this forthcoming summer's transfer window.",
      "According to a report by the Mirror, United are 'weighing up' a move for the 23-year-old, who joined Wolves from Brazilian outfit Flamengo in January 2023. It is claimed the Reds have 'identified' him as a potential replacement for Casemiro, who could be sold this summer.",
      "Casemiro, despite playing a starring role in United's third-placed finish in the Premier League last season, has regressed considerably this term, failing to provide the defensive nous and control he so often contributed in his maiden season at Old Trafford. His passing, at times, has been erratic, meaning he has often left the Reds exposed.",
      "But as a result of Sofyan Amrabat failing to have the impact he would have liked after arriving from Fiorentina on loan last September, it has meant Erik ten Hag has often stuck with Casemiro. However, he is now at risk of facing a fresh stint on the sidelines with a recurring hamstring problem.",
      "He missed Sunday's FA Cup win over Liverpool but was not replaced by Amrabat, who is the most like-for-like candidate within the squad to succeed him in the defensive-midfield berth. Instead, Ten Hag parachuted in Scott McTominay, meaning Kobbie Mainoo was tasked with operating slightly deeper.",
      "Mainoo, who was outstanding against the Merseyside outfit, often drove forward from deep, leaving United exposed in the centre of the pitch. The youngster's showing demonstrated that his long-term future is as a progressive-midfielder, operating as a No.8, opposed to doing the dirty side of the game in the No.6 berth.",
      "It is why United, ideally, need to sign an adequate defensive-midfielder ahead of next season who can complement his qualities and give the Reds more balance in the engine room. They have already been linked with a collection of potential candidates, the latest being Gomes.",
      "The Brazilian has made impressive strides since arriving in England a little over 12 months ago, establishing himself as one of the most promising defensive-midfielders in the Premier League. This season, only Fulham's João Palinha (110), who has been linked with United in the past, and Sheffield United midfielder Vinícius Souza (105) have completed more tackles in the Premier League than Gomes (83).",
      "Gomes has averaged 3.5 tackles per 90 in the Premier League this term, a record that can only be bettered by Palinha (4.6) and Souza (3.9). Known as 'The Pitbull' during his time at Flamengo, Gomes thrives on winning the ball back and doing the dirty side of the game, highlighted by his tally of 5.5 ball recoveries per 90 in the Premier League this season.",
      "Casemiro, by comparison, has averaged 3.3 tackles per 90 and 4.9 ball recoveries per 90 in the Premier League this season. As a caveat, Gomes has featured in nine more league games than the United midfield enforcer this term.",
      "Mainoo, despite his all-round capabilities, is developing a skillset that suggests he wants to attack the penalty area and drive forward. He has the thrust and technical ability to do that, though he cannot be discounted from sitting deep and dictating play from that area of the pitch.",
      "Ultimately, Gomes, who has scored three goals for Wolves this season, ticks several boxes that would enable him to slot into United's midfield and conduct the role as the anchor, providing a layer of protection for the back-four behind him, while being able to dictate from deep. United, most importantly, need to ensure they get this signing right, both in terms of finding the right balance for the team and to help enhance Mainoo's progress.",

Earlier this month it was the news that a new task force had been created, as the new United part-owner enlisted the help of Lord Sebastian Coe and Gary Neville, among others, to look into options regarding the future of Old Trafford.",

      "Latest Man United news and gossip as academy chief Nick Cox has explained how midfielder Kobbie Mainoo shares the same trait as the best players in the world",
      "Manchester United's academy chief Nick Cox has identified the personality trait that Kobbie Mainoo shares with the best players in the world.",
      "Mainoo is enjoying his breakthrough season at United, having made 23 appearances for the club this term. The 18-year-old has been handed a regular spot in the first-team squad by manager Erik ten Hag this season, after handing him his senior debut in January last year.",
      "This week saw Mainoo called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for the first time, as the Three Lions have friendly fixtures against Brazil and Belgium. Mainoo had originally been selected for the Under-21 squad before being added to the senior squad this week.",
      "Mainoo's performances have not come as a surprise to the coaching staff at United's academy. Cox has helped oversee the teenager's development with the youth teams at Carrington, and has explained the talent that the United midfielder possesses that puts him alongside the best in the world - his ability to 'play with a joy and freedom'.",
      "\"Our fans are naturally really supportive of the young players and give them great encouragement, but ultimately, you’ve got to show you’re deserving of being in the team,\" Cox told United's club website. \"The manager is quite vocal about the fact that he doesn’t do favours; you have to earn it and you only get there because you deserve it. For Kobbie to be doing what he’s doing, without work experience or a loan, is amazing.",
      "\"Our programme is designed to nurture that childhood love of the game and not be a professional too soon. If you make it feel professional too quickly then it starts to feel like a job.",
      "\"I believe we’ve got expert staff here who teach the right things and make sure the boys are supported and challenged, but we make sure they never lose that childlike obsession with the intrinsic love of exploring the ball and learning through the game. Kobbie has always loved the ball and been extremely comfortable with it.",
      "\"I believe the best players in the world play with a joy and freedom which comes from being autotelic, which is to say that they are completely self-motivated by what they do.",
      "\"They may be in the spotlight on the biggest stage, but they’re playing with the same freedom and joy that they had when they first kicked a ball.",
      "\"And I think that’s what we see in Kobbie. Some of that is because of our programme; some is just the character and temperament he brought to our programme.",
      "\"He absolutely has a long way to go, of course, and he’s got to keep getting picked week after week, but he knows that already. That won’t come as a shock to him.\"",

      "Ineos are set to appoint Dan Ashworth as sporting director at Man Utd and he has already explained his own views when it comes to squad building.",
      "Dan Ashworth has plenty of time to finetune his plans for Manchester United as he wiles away his hours in the garden, waiting for the club that wants him as their new sporting director to agree a deal that will take him away from Newcastle.",
      "The two clubs continue to try and reach an agreement that will see Ashworth take control of the Ineos project at Old Trafford sooner rather than later, but Newcastle's demand for upwards of £15million has been laughed off publicly and privately in Manchester. While a stalemate ensues, Ashworth remains on gardening leave, catching up on Netflix perhaps, or more likely dreaming up the ideas that he believes will take this club back to the top.",
      "You can see why running the football operations at Manchester United would appeal. It doesn't quite feel right to describe United as a sleeping giant, but this is a behemoth of a football club that is significantly underperforming, based on reputation, history, investment and potential. The rewards for those who finally get it right will be golden.",
      "Ashworth will head up a much more detailed football structure that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford are putting in place, with the 53-year-old then reporting to new chief executive Omar Berrada, who will start in the summer when his period of gardening leave ends.",
      "Having held similar roles with West Brom, Brighton and Newcastle, as well as being the technical director at the Football Association, Ashworth's methods aren't entirely a mystery, even if some of his philosophies will have to change when he is in charge of a club of this size. One area he is always keen to focus on is a club's academy and at United it is a rich source of potential.",
      "Erik ten Hag has promoted Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho to the first team and others have got their chance this season thanks to an injury crisis. But United still carry a bloated squad and there could be an exodus this summer, with as many as a dozen senior players potentially departing.",
      "Don't expect all of them to be replaced. For starters, they don't need to be replaced, while Ashworth's view, as laid out in a fascinating interview with the Training Ground Guru in December 2020, when he was at Brighton, is that Premier League clubs should look to youth more and avoid the temptation of using the financial resources they have compared to other European leagues.",
      "\"Of all my roles, the one I’m most passionate about is opening up pathways for young players. Sometimes I've seen clubs work in silos and the academy is working all hours god sends to try and develop players for the first team and the recruitment department is working all hours god sends to try and sign players,\" Ashworth said.",
      "\"In that scenario the recruitment department might be busy looking at a right-back from overseas when there's one right under their noses in the Academy.",
      "\"From a Premier League point of view - and I have been guilty of this - because you have so much money in relation to the majority of the other leagues in the world you can compete for most players in the world. That applies to Brighton too, even though we’re not a top six club.",
      "\"When you are trying to put together a squad that can survive and thrive in the Premier League, the temptation is to go with proven players that are able to come in and are ‘here and now ready.'\"",
      "United's academy will be confident of being able to supply players who can fill gaps in the squad. Willy Kambwala has had first-team experience this season and might be able to fill the role of fourth or fifth-choice centre-back next season, for example.",
      "Finding gems from the academy is even more valuable in an era of strict financial controls. United are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules at the moment, so promoting from within after a sale might be an area they can benefit from this summer.",
      "Ashworth won't be directly in charge of recruitment, but he will overseeing football operations at the club, which essentially means everyone will be reporting into him. He can set the tone for a club that should be focusing on signing star players and then bolstering the squad with the pipeline of talent that Manchester United has always produced.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",
      "However, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to the Chigwell Construction Stadium to take on 10th-place West Ham on Sunday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal in the Women's Super League at a sold-old Emirates Stadium in what could prove to be a huge blow to the Reds' Champions League hopes",
      "If last season's triumph at the Emirates was evidence of Manchester United's burgeoning Women's Super League (WSL) pedigree, then it was on the same stage that all of the Reds' deficiencies this term were brought into sharp focus.",
      "It was back in November 2022 that Alessia Russo's late strike helped Marc Skinner's side come from behind to claim all three points against the Gunners. But, on Saturday afternoon, the England forward was a second-half substitute for the hosts as they romped to a 3-1 victory in North London, putting United's hopes of European qualification this season of life support.",
      "In truth, the damage was done long before Russo entered the pitch, as a Geyse own goal and efforts from Cloe Lacasse and Kim Little had Arsenal in firm control of the contest before the break. \"We have to be the one to get under the skin and we have to be the team that doesn’t just try and win one way,\" Skinner asserted pre-match.",
      "But from the moment the Gunners got their noses in front at a sold-out Emirates, it was United who looked unnerved by their opponents' intensity. The Reds had started well enough, with Nikita Parris seizing upon a fumbled clearance from Sabrina D'Angelo and flashing an effort just wide of the post.",
      "READ MORE:I wanted to buy United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Ratcliffe",
      "But Skinner's side were made to pay for the spurned opportunity when Katie McCabe's low corner deflected off their no.23 and into the back of the net to give Arsenal the lead inside 10 minutes. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage when Beth Mead's curling shot deflected narrowly wide of Mary Earps' far post, and again when Stina Blackstenius was played through on goal by Cloe Lacasse but, on both occasions, the interventions of Millie Turner proved decisive.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United came close to restoring parity when Ella Toone's strike ricocheted off the leg of Laia Codina and bobbled just off target. But it wasn't long before the Gunners were back on the front foot; Lacasse nodding home after Katie Zelem's miscued clearance arced straight into her path.",
      "The hosts' grip on the contest was further strengthened on the stroke of half-time, when captain Kim Little coolly dispatched the penalty after Beth Mead was upended by Gemma Evans inside the area. With Eidevall's side threatening to run away with it, Skinner unsurprisingly made an attacking change at the break, as Leah Galton was brought on in place of Gemma Evans.",
      "But it was Arsenal who looked the likeliest to find the back of the net; Blackstenius drawing a smart stop from Earps before Mead's strike cannoned off the post. The look of despondency on the face of Parris after she was, for what must have felt like the hundredth time on Saturday afternoon, called offside, spoke volumes about the meekness of United's showing in the capital.",
      "Lucia Garcia's instinctive finish in the final minute of stoppage time proved to be nothing more than a scant consolation prize for the visitors, who will know that only a flawless end to the season will be enough to keep their hopes of winning a Champions League spot alive.",
      "\"I don't think the word 'damaging' is the conversation,\" Skinner reflected post-match when queried on the potential repercussions of the result. \"We're still chasing. We're seven points behind Arsenal. We have to chase and that's what our team are resilient enough to do.\"",
      "On the criticism coming from some quarters of the United fanbase, Skinner added: \"It's part and parcel of the job. Some people love what you do, some people hate what you do. But we would never stop people from having an opinion. That's not what I'm here for.\"",
      "Though Skinner was keen to stress otherwise, Saturday's defeat is hugely detrimental to United's European ambitions. Of course, it is not just the manager who should be held accountable for the result: the Reds failed to perform to their full capacity and the players will know much more is required if they are to prevent this season from going out with a whimper.",
      "For the United boss, though, it is a defeat that raises further question marks around his own future ahead of the expiration of his contract this summer. Certainly, the voices crying for Skinner's removal will continue to grow louder in the days ahead and, at a time where the club as a whole is at the start of a brand new era, it feels like a period of change for the women's team, too, is inevitable.",

      "Gareth Southgate is preparing to lead England into the fourth major tournament of his tenure, having reached the quarter-finals, final and semi-final of the previous three; England boss has been linked to Manchester United job with Erik ten Hag's future uncertain",
      "By Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett",
      "Saturday 23 March 2024 06:53, UK",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with replacing Erik ten Hag at Manchester United this summer - but would he be a good fit at Old Trafford?",
      "The England manager dismissed the rumours as \"disrespectful\" in a press conference on Friday, and said he \"wouldn't entertain speaking to anybody else\" before the Euros this summer.",
      "But with speculation increasing this week, Sky Sports News senior reporters Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett analyse Southgate's spell with England and whether he could succeed in club football.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy:",
      "When the initial whispers of Gareth Southgate being on a shortlist to become Manchester United manager circled at the start of March, several at the club shot down the links as \"easy to make\" due to Dan Ashworth's impending appointment as sporting director.",
      "The pair worked together through the FA, maintain a strong existing relationship, and shared aligned thoughts on the mechanics behind a successful football operation.",
      "The murmurs have now morphed into ear-splitting noise, with Sir Dave Brailsford, who has also collaborated with Southgate through the INEOS Leaders in Sport programme, reportedly endorsing the England manager.",
      "United have not commented on any of the rumours given Erik ten Hag is still in post, no definitive decision has been taken over his future, and there is still the FA Cup plus securing Champions League football to play for. The club are planning for next season with Ten Hag, including with potential recruitments and for summer tour plans.",
      "There is great annoyance that the high point of their season - the late, galvanising 4-3 victory over Liverpool at an enraptured Old Trafford - has been so quickly followed by such speculation.",
      "Some feel Ten Hag is being undercut and there is certain division in some quarters over the suitability of Southgate for the position.",
      "The greatest concern is how someone who hasn't been involved in the club game for 15 years - he was fired from Middlesbrough after overseeing their relegation from the Premier League in 2008-09 - can walk into its biggest job when he's not even in the conversation for any others.",
      "As one source put it: \"Would any other top club be looking at him this summer? Would Liverpool hire him? Bayern Munich? So why would Manchester United?\"",
      "The reaction to the links from a variety of supporters - fan media, forums, social discussion - has been negative. The local paper carried a piece saying \"Ten Hag's popularity has soared\" and that \"even those who prefer him to part ways with the club would rather he continue than Southgate be appointed.\"",
      "There is a framing, whether rightly or wrongly, of the England manager being too pragmatic, risk-averse and failing to truly maximise the depth of attacking talent at his disposal.",
      "Rewinding through World Cups and the Euros, a cautious approach has tended to be a triumphant one, but that wouldn't wash at United.",
      "There is also scepticism over Southgate given his poor record against the strongest international teams, which was reiterated in the defeat to France at the 2022 World Cup. England have won just seven of their 22 matches (32 per cent) against the current world top 10. How England react when they concede first, the manager's substitutions and a lack of ruthless edge have all been criticised.",
      "Appointing a manager that the fans are apprehensive of, and are not all in on from the start doesn't tend to be a wise choice.",
      "However, Brailsford and Ashworth reportedly believe that Southgate's transformation of the culture, quality, and buy-in around the national team is exactly what United need and that his work can be translated to a day-to-day environment.",
      "There's the benefit at England of fielding players already steeped in the reset having represented the youth teams, although Southgate did heavily contribute to the 'England DNA' directive, the fact that much of the squad come in from environments of excellence - Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal - and that a few camps a year is not the same as a blueprint to be implemented daily.",
      "Southgate's authenticity, empathy and honesty would register well as a representative of the club. He would have supporters in the dressing room from the England contingent. Counterpoints have been made over if he would attract elite foreign players in the market, and if those who don't wear the Three Lions shirt at United would be enthused or underwhelmed by his appointment.",
      "Southgate has received a nod of approval from Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Roy Keane.",
      "United haven't made their decision yet. They have to be conscious of financial parameters and compensation for the England manager would be shy of a lowly £1m.",
      "Southgate, whose contract expires in December, has not made any declaration over his future yet either. A choice will need to be communicated before the end of the season to help the FA, United and any other potential opportunity plan.",
      "While everything is still up in the air, one thing is certain: Southgate to United would not be a universally popular appointment.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:",
      "From the very start, when he took over as manager of the national team in 2016, Southgate's mission was two-fold: to make the nation fall in love with the England team again and to make the players fall in love with the idea of representing their country.",
      "He felt that if he could achieve those two things, along with the obvious quality in the ranks of the playing staff, England would have a real chance of winning a major trophy for the first time since 1966.",
      "His entire ethos has been based around trying to make the England squad, and St George's Park, replicate what it's like for a player in their club environment. His philosophy has worked perfectly. Apart from the trophy bit.",
      "When Southgate took over, the England camp was too often split along club lines. There were, at times, cliques within the squad - those that got on and those that didn't. It wasn't uncommon for players to withdraw from the England squad with minor ailments or simply make an excuse not to be there.",
      "The FA staff have encouraged players to spend time together, at work, at play and at mealtimes. What is obvious now is just how well the vast majority of England players get on. That's why Ben White's request to be omitted from England call-ups going forward stands out as unusual.",
      "The evidence of Southgate's success in this area has been obvious when the summer internationals have come round - usually within days of the Champions League final. In 2019, Tottenham and Liverpool - with nine opposing players included in the England squad - went head to head in Madrid. England's Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands was just five days after the final.",
      "The same thing happened in 2021 when Chelsea and Manchester City met in the final in Istanbul. Seven England players featured in that final four days before England played their first Euros warm-up game against Austria.",
      "Southgate knew those would be incredibly difficult situations, with one set of players elated and the other devastated, with club rivalries exposed for all to see. But on both occasions, those players re-bonded immediately once they met up, united by a shared mission to succeed with England. That is no small achievement from the manager.",
      "A big part of Southgate's plan to make the players motivated to go away with England, rather than go to a beach in Dubai, has been a sense of fun. Enjoyment is at the heart of every camp, with the serious business of preparing for elite-level matches weaved in cleverly.",
      "Remember Harry Maguire and Jesse Lingard messing around on inflatable unicorns in the hotel pool during the World Cup, the day after England had beaten Tunisia. Take a glance at the FA social media pages while the players are in camp to see them playing basketball, competing in a silly quiz or taking on a challenge to roll a ping pong ball into various plastic cups, avoiding an outstretched tape measure.",
      "By and large, the England players enjoy their time away with their country. During Euro 2020, when Conor Coady didn't get a minute on the pitch as England made it to the final he described it as \"the best experience of my life\". He just loved being part of the collective. Even though it cost him four weeks of his summer holiday. Extraordinary.",
      "The FA photos and videos of the players arriving at the National Football Centre are always full of smiling faces, warm greetings, players and friends reunited. New additions to the squad are welcomed in, shown around and integrated quickly.",
      "Overall, it's clear Southgate and his staff have created an incredibly positive, welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for the England players. They have revolutionised England camps, and the mood among the players, and they've seen a massive jump in success on the pitch as a result.",
      "The question is, could that be replicated at one of the big European clubs like Manchester United?",
      "The same fatherly care for the players - both in public and in private - would be a given if Southgate were the manager at Old Trafford, reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's bond with his players.",
      "The same clever motivational techniques and determination to treat the players with respect would also be easily transferrable and roundly welcomed for sure.",
      "But would Southgate's other techniques work so well?",
      "Some England players have told me that being away with their country sometimes feels like a holiday, a break from the club routine. Would that work so well if those activities were the daily club routine?",
      "There are obvious question marks over Southgate's record as a club manager. When he spoke to Sky Sports in December, he was adamant that his time at Middlesbrough was a much bigger success than he was given credit for.",
      "Southgate has been repeatedly criticised by pundits for his tactical prowess or lack of it. Many will never forgive him for the lack of attacking substitutions during extra time at Wembley in the Euro 2021 final when it seemed Italy's ageing defenders were vulnerable.",
      "So, the jury is out. Southgate has done a quite brilliant job with England, but there are doubts whether he would be able to do the same at a club like Manchester United.",

      "Former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique speaks exclusively to Sky Sports about how the game needs to change to stay relevant; Pique won nine league titles in Spain and England, four Champions League trophies, as well as a World Cup and European Championship",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 07:54, UK",
      "\"It's always good to be back,\" announces Gerard Pique with fondness as he declines the offer of a pause between interviews. \"I love being in the UK as I spent four years growing up here. The weather is always grey but at least it's not raining.\"",
      "Osterley's overcast sky is a far cry from Barcelona. But for a man so decorated from an illustrious playing career, not even a deluge could dampen the spirits of someone fresh from an early flight who has won it all. That his medals totalling over 30 are boxed in an office back home betrays an individual in touch with the present.",
      "As welcoming a guest as he was gracious on the pitch, Pique is a world champion turned visionary hell-bent on creating a version of the game that is more in keeping with the demands of the modern world.",
      "There have been other, less successful, ventures but having hung up his boots following 18 years at the sharp end of the professional game, Pique is confident he has backed another winner.",
      "The Kings League is just over a year on from its launch in Spain, an offbeat seven-a-side game where team owners are content creators expanding to the Americas with Mexico hosting an inaugural World Cup in May.",
      "Where late goals count double in 40-minute matches, draws don't exist and audiences are larger than some LaLiga games, what drove one of the greatest defenders of all time to pursue what has been described as the Twenty20 of football?",
      "\"I felt there was a need to appeal to the next generation,\" Pique explains to Sky Sports. \"There's a lot of young people who are attracted more to entertainment that is short and exciting.",
      "\"It was important to find something where they couldn't lose focus. What is happening with traditional football is that 90 minutes is too long for the new generation.",
      "One manager who has been linked with heading to the Premier League is the Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso.\n\n\n\nPique played with Alonso at international level and says his step into management was an inevitability.\n\n\n\n\"For sure, I could see he had what it took to be a successful manager. He absolutely loves football. He understands how to play the game and it's very similar to Sergio Busquets.\n\n\n\n\"Busquets is still playing but he will be another incredible coach. Xabi has demonstrated at Bayer Leverkusen why he is so highly regarded.\n\n\n\n\"He is having the perfect season in not losing. Let's see next year what he's doing. Everyone says Liverpool will be an option after Klopp leaves, so let's see.\"",
      "\"That's not the case for the semi-finals, the final of the Champions League or the last games of the league but there are too many games and people get lost in all the competitions.",
      "\"We wanted to create a product that is similar to football as there are a lot of people who like football and they also like the Kings League.",
      "\"It's a different product with crazy rules but the key is that I see it as being complementary.\"",
      "Penetrating a Spanish-speaking audience is perhaps unsurprising given Pique's global reach. Three Champions Leagues and nine LaLigas with Barcelona, a World Cup and a European Championship with Spain is being put to good use.",
      "The Kings World Cup which runs from May 28 through to June 8 is expected to build on the capacity crowds witnessed at the Camp Nou and the Wanda Metropolitano last year.",
      "Ronaldinho, Andrea Pirlo, Andriy Shevchenko and Sergio Aguero have all brought extra kudos to this form of chaos, but Pique is keeping his cards close to his chest when pressed on future guest appearances.",
      "\"The presidents love to make big signings - legends of the game have played,\" the 37-year-old outlines with the promise of another stellar cast.",
      "\"For the World Cup, top players are being signed. Next Monday, there's a huge player we'll announce is playing in the competition.",
      "\"He's someone who has played in the Premier League and it's very recent that he retired so I think you'll love the name.\"",
      "The culture of player fandom has exploded since the advent of social media and clubs are acutely aware of how page views and following can swell exponentially if footballing talent is matched by off-field marketability.",
      "For a growing number of football aficionados, satisfying that appetite for a deeper connection with the game's biggest stars feels increasingly inaccessible. Pique feels that disconnect has to be addressed.",
      "\"Clubs nowadays are trying to protect players,\" he admits. \"There's good intention behind it as they don't want them to be exposed. So if you really want to get to know a player... what he likes, his dislikes, his personality, it's very difficult.",
      "\"There are young lads coming through at Barcelona but you don't know much about them because they're overly protected.",
      "\"In our world with the Kings League, what we want to do is the opposite. The players create their own channels on Twitch and YouTube. They talk a lot to their communities, and they want to be famous.",
      "\"This is the big difference from traditional football. In our ecosystem, every day there's a lot of content. On Twitch, you can see a coach talking to a player of another club or a president of another club discussing transfers.",
      "\"Football will forever by the king of the sport and the most followed but it's impossible that this could happen in the game we all know.\"",
      "While football's tradition and what Pique describes as a \"fractured\" ecosystem means altering any rule is met with robust opposition, the Kings League is built around the audience voting for changes themselves on a weekly basis.",
      "Recently, 200,000 streamers voted over a change to the colour of the artificial pitch. Green became black.",
      "\"If there is a rule that doesn't work, we change it the next weekend,\" adds Pique. \"The audience feel the Kings League is owned by them as we give them the power to vote on change.",
      "\"You want offside, or you don't? You want 40-minute or 30-minute games? Now, our grass is black. So, it's real football but in a way it's a video game. There's this mix and this balance that works very well.\"",
      "Some critics have labelled the concept a \"circus\" for TikTokers and YouTubers, and Pique would be inclined to agree.",
      "\"In a way, it's true. We are a mix of sport and entertainment. We want to put on a show. But it is very well balanced because they really care about winning.",
      "\"I see a lot of players and presidents crying when they don't reach the finals. But, at the same time you're having fun. The fact finals are being held at a big stadium tells you the interest is there.",
      "\"The players have never been in front of that many fans so for them not to qualify for the finals is very painful. You can see that they really care about winning and that's very important.\"",
      "While Barcelona find themselves eight points adrift of Real Madrid in LaLiga, their presence in the Champions League quarter-finals offers the promise of something greater.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Erik ten Hag's United, and the man whose departure from Old Trafford in 2008 was described by Sir Alex Ferguson as one of his \"biggest regrets\" believes more trust needs to be instilled in the club's academy products.",
      "Reflecting on his two former clubs, Pique says: \"The difference with Barcelona is that this period of transition at Manchester United has been going on now for quite a long period of time.",
      "\"It's been quite a few years that they've not been able to win the title. I think that after Sir Alex left, they lost a little bit their focus and guidance.",
      "\"They didn't know where to go. Little by little, they are trying to put everything back together in order to compete for titles.",
      "\"I still believe Ten Hag is a very good coach. I don't really know if he will be able to turn things around but the win against Liverpool [in the FA Cup] was incredible.",
      "\"It's the sort of victory that will give them power for the rest of the season. Then, I would say they need to trust more in the people coming through from the academy.",
      "\"It happens when you are suffering as a club. It was the same at Barcelona, but you have to trust in the academy players. We saw Sir Alex Ferguson show this with the Class of '92 and they have to trust in the next generation in the same way.",
      "\"In the last few years, they've spent a lot of money, and it hasn't worked out. So why not try to give the new, young generation the chance to at least try and perform.\"",

      "Who is the Premier League's most improved team? And who has had the biggest drop off? We take a look at how each Premier League team compares to where they were at this stage last year...",
      "By Ella-Esrene Frederick",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 18:19, UK",
      "With the Premier League reaching its final stretch of games,  we take a look at where each team were at this stage last season and how they compare to this year with 10 games remaining.",
      "Arsenal find themselves in the same spot as last season, top of the table after five consecutive wins. However, they are five points worse off with 64 points rather than the 69 they collected at this stage last season.",
      "Last season they had an eight-point cushion on Manchester City (who had a game in hand). This year the advantage on Liverpool is just goal difference, with City a point back.",
      "With more experience after a disappointing ending to last season's title race, the Gunners will be hoping they keep their place on top this time.",
      "Liverpool have made the biggest leap of any team from last season, now looking like the Jurgen Klopp teams of old that have gone head-to-head with Manchester City in title races past.",
      "At this stage last season, Liverpool only had 43 points and were facing an uphill battle in their chase for a top-four finish. This season they find themselves back on top with 64 points and only second on goal difference.",
      "Despite the drop-off last season, Liverpool did finish in good form, winning seven of their last 10 games and narrowly missing out on the top four. They will be hoping for similar form in their remaining 10 games in the quest to give Klopp a dream farewell.",
      "Treble hangover? City are only a point off the 64 they had at this stage last season - and much closer to the summit, being a point off top with league leaders Arsenal coming to the Etihad, live on Sky Sports, next.",
      "To City's advantage this is where they usually find their best form. They won an astonishing nine out of the last 10 in the 22/23 season, while also winning the Champions League and FA Cup. A formidable side who will be confident of landing a fourth Premier League title in a row.",
      "Unai Emery's first full season with Aston Villa could not be going much better. After ending last season in the European places, the progress continues with Villa pushing for a Champions League spot.",
      "They have progressed significantly in terms of points, with four more wins than at this point of last season with nine games remaining.",
      "There's a good feeling around Tottenham with Ange Postecoglou bringing excitement back to the club with his attacking style of play - but they are just four points better off than they were towards the troubled end of Antonio Conte's tenure.",
      "However, improving the points total and challenging for Champions League qualification despite selling star man Harry Kane will be a decent return for Postecoglou in his first season in charge.",
      "Are United going backwards? Erik ten Hag had a good first season at Manchester United, beating Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final and securing a top-four finish. With a slow start to this Premier League season, losing three of their first five Premier League matches, United find themselves six points adrift at this stage, 47 to last year's 53.",
      "With a top-five finish possibly securing a Champions league place, Manchester United remain in touching distance but will have to show their best form if they want to overtake Tottenham and Aston Villa.",
      "The Europa Conference League winners were battling relegation at this stage last season, with just 27 points to their name with nine games to go. But this year they have found a better balance between their Premier League and European commitments. The Europa League quarter-finalists sit in seventh place domestically with a much healthier points total.",
      "Brighton were one of the success stories of last season, displaying excellent football under newly appointed manager Roberto De Zerbi and securing a Europa League place in reward for their efforts.",
      "But after losing their midfield duo of Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool and Moises Caicedo to Chelsea, it was always going to be difficult to replicate. Brighton have struggled to find consistency in this campaign, but only sit four points worse off with 10 games to go.",
      "Gary O'Neil has led Wolves to a really good Premier League campaign so far in his first season at the club, earning impressive wins against the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham, despite having to offload some big names for financial reasons in the summer.",
      "After being dismissed by Bournemouth at the end of last season despite keeping the club from relegation, O'Neil has led Wolves to 41 points so far, sitting in ninth place. It's a huge improvement from the 27 points at this stage of last season when they were in the lower end of the table.",
      "The biggest fallers among the top sides, Newcastle's tally of 40 points is an alarming 13 fewer than they had with 10 to play last season. With European football to contend with this season and injuries to key players such as Nick Pope, captain Kieran Trippier, Callum Wilson and Joelinton, Newcastle have not been able to produce the standards of last season thus far. They sit in 10th and will be hoping for a big finish.",
      "After a turbulent first season under Chelsea's new ownership and multiple managerial changes, Mauricio Pochettino has only managed to edge the Blues up by one point so far this term, gaining 39 points to last season's 38 with 27 games played. With the money spent in the summer and Chelsea sitting in 11th place, Pochettino will be hoping to drive his side up the table with the remaining 11 fixtures - as well as delivering FA Cup success.",
      "Marco Silva's team have had a similar season in terms of points in comparison to last year. Despite losing their top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, they are only slightly down on last year when they had 39 points.",
      "Bournemouth have found improvement, led by a sharp-shooting Dominic Solanke who has 15 goals this campaign. The Cherries find themselves with 35 points and have a top-half place in sight - a big step up on their relegation battle last season.",
      "Crystal Palace have remained largely consistent with 29 points compared to last year's 27 - the managerial changes of Roy Hodgson replacing Patrick Vieira and Oliver Glasner replacing Hodgson steering them away from relegation in both seasons.",
      "Brentford were pushing for the European places this time last season. This season, the aim is to avoid relegation. It's the biggest drop in terms of points from any team, with the absence of the banned Ivan Toney not helping.",
      "Everton are one point worse off than they were at this stage last season - but that includes the six-point deduction they've been handed by the Premier League for financial issues. They remain in the relegation scrap, four points above the drop zone. They were just two points above the bottom three with 10 to play last season.",
      "A four-point deduction for financial issues from the Premier League has dropped Nottingham Forest into the relegation zone, where they are six points worse off than at the same point last year under Steve Cooper, who ultimately led them to safety.",
      "With 10 games to go, last season's relegated sides all had more points than Sheffield United (14 points), Burnley (17 from 29 games) and Luton (22 from 19 games) do right now.",
      "Southampton were on 23 points, with Leicester (25) and Leeds (26) marginally better off.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has taken control of football operations at Man Utd, wants to bring a new transfer strategy to Old Trafford; \"I'd rather find the next Kylian Mbappe than spend a fortune trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club Podcast",
      "Wednesday 20 March 2024 10:24, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he would rather unearth the next Kylian Mbappe for Manchester United than spend a fortune on the France forward.",
      "Ratcliffe, whose INEOS company has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford, wants to move away from the approach of trying to buy success, as has been the case under the Glazers.",
      "United have spent more than £1bn on signings since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 but failed to challenge for the Premier League title, coming closest when finishing 12 points behind Man City in 2020/21 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Ratcliffe, though, made clear he will not rush plans to return United to the top as he shed light on INEOS' overhaul of the club's recruitment strategy.",
      "\"I'd rather find the next Mbappe than spend a fortune trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club Podcast. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anyone could figure that one out. Much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe or Jude Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, the architect of Great Britain's success in cycling, is overseeing the creation of the new-look football operation at Old Trafford and has already brought in Omar Berrada from Man City to become the club's chief executive.",

      "Ratcliffe says getting the right structure in place is the key to solving United's issues in the transfer market.",
      "Asked if he would like to sign Bellingham, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They've done that over the last 10 years.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club and make sure we get recruitment right. It's such a vital part of running a football club today, finding new players.\"",
      "Asked if that will be Brailsford's job, he added: \"It's not the only part but it is a big part of it. It's a collective at the end of the day. Dave is the one who is right in the middle of it all. It is where you start.",
      "\"You need the right organisation structure. In the days of Sir Alex Ferguson, he was the manager. We don't have managers today, we have a coach. And the coach would report to a sporting director and they would report to the chief executive.",
      "\"You need to figure out where you put recruitment and strategy, you need to get your organisation right and then populate it with people who are best in class.\"",
      "He added: \"It's not a light switch at Man Utd, it's a much longer road to travel, because there's so many aspects of that club and that game that you need to get right.\"",
      "Brailsford is at the heart of this process, but Ratcliffe insists his role will not stretch to identifying potential signings.",
      "\"Dave wouldn't profess to ever say, 'we need to buy that player because I think he's a very good player', Dave would never do that, it's not his skill set. But we need that skill set at Manchester United,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "Asked how hands-on he will be, Ratcliffe added: \"We all talk on a daily basis, there's a group of us involved in Manchester United but the two people most focused on it would be Dave and myself.",
      "\"We've now got Omar Berrada, of course, who's on gardening leave at the moment but he's become a big part of a trio when he settles in. He's come from Man City and will be the chief executive.\""

      "Kobbie Mainoo and ‘the arrogance of timing’ – former Man Utd coach explains why midfielder now called up by England appears to have so much time on the ball.",
      "Tuesday 19 March 2024 14:47, UK",
      "Speaking to Erik ten Hag about Kobbie Mainoo earlier this season, his verdict was as follows: “He looks very composed,” he told Sky Sports. “He is very mature for his age. What he brings to the team is his composure and his game understanding.”",
      "Composure. Ten Hag reached for variations on that word twice in just three sentences. Watching Mainoo, 18, it makes sense. He appears to have time when others do not, finds space where others do not. But why is that? What is it that he is doing differently?",
      "Every player at the top level of the game should be able to control the ball and pass it in a straight line. Much of Mainoo's work looks that simple. And yet, doing that in the heat of the midfield battle, when the opposition are pressing him, should not be this easy.",
      "Paul McGuinness, the former Manchester United academy coach, has an explanation. \"It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes.",
      "\"Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it. All the connections are flowing.",
      "\"There is a lot to it. He has to have the picture beforehand. He has to show for the ball quickly and that means making two or three quick steps. That is what gives him more time. If he just waits for the passes to come to him, he will not have that time.",
      "\"As the ball is coming, he has to be looking again, to be on the half turn to know whether he will be able to turn or not.",
      "\"Because he knows what he wants to do before he gets it, what he does is that he makes sure that the first touch gets the ball into the right place to set up the next pass. It looks like he has time because he does not need two or three touches, he has set it up with one.",
      "\"That saves those milliseconds when people are pressing him.",
      "\"He has prepared the space, lost his marker, already had a look when the ball is coming so that he can take it away from the man. Now, it looks like he has time on the ball. But it is all those little things that have to come together. He is a really clever player.\"",
      "But there is another key difference between Mainoo and many other Premier League players. \"He keeps the ball really close,\" says McGuinness. \"That is deceptive. If you keep the ball close to you then it means that you can play the ball at any time.\"",
      "It goes against some of the received wisdom. \"People say that you should get the ball out from under your feet but if the ball is two or three yards away from your feet then the opponent knows that they can press you because you cannot pass it.\"",
      "Former United academy chief Jim Ryan had a phrase for this. \"He used to call it the arrogance of timing,\" adds McGuinness. \"Kobbie has that. He can wait until that last moment and use the press against them.\" His first senior goal highlighted that.",
      "Mainoo's timing when scoring the 97th-minute winner at Wolves was exquisite in more ways than one. As Max Kilman went to close him down, he nutmegged him. \"When he stuck the ball between the lad's legs, that was a perfect example,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"It looks like he is going to pass it again but he can just turn his foot at the last second and play the ball through the legs.",
      "\"There is that little bit of disguise to it. You are making an illusion that you are going to play the ball forward. To do that, you have to have poise, confidence in your own ability, and the disguise has to look perfect. You are like a magician doing an illusion.\"",
      "As well as his tidy use of the ball, Mainoo is a dribbler. Indeed, he completed six dribbles in the recent win over Luton - the most by a Manchester United player this season or last. That is unusual for a central midfielder but it is a product of his close control.",
      "\"Being able to keep the ball close, it gives you more options. You can play it around the corner and go against the flow, beating them with a change of speed. He does not look an outstandingly quick player, so he is doing it with real efficiency, to change the direction.\"",
      "More often than not, Mainoo does keep it simple. That works in his favour too. \"Because he is doing that a lot of the time, he is difficult to read. It looks like a pass to the wide man but at the last second he can play the ball behind the full-back,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"Ninety per cent of the time, he plays the simple pass, keeps it moving, does the right thing. But because he is doing that, he has then got that element of surprise to his game every now and again when he does try to do something out of the ordinary.\"",
      "When Ten Hag talks of composure and maturity, he is also talking about decision-making. Mainoo looks mature because he does the right things. It was noted how he responded to being caught in possession for a West Ham goal earlier in the season.",
      "\"He has the personality,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"That is what you need if you want to play here.\"",
      "When the game at Luton became frantic, Mainoo was the one who maintained his calm even as more senior players appeared caught up in the frenzied atmosphere. Sometimes the bravest thing in football is not to run around but to put a foot on the ball.",
      "\"The ball carrier is in charge of the game,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"He looks like that. It is as if he is saying, I am in charge, I will decide.\"",
      "The football style of the future, perhaps? \"It has become a bigger feature because of what the defenders are doing at Brighton. They are baiting them, drawing them on like a matador and then using the space that they have left behind them.\"",
      "Whether Manchester United are going to be at the vanguard, among the better exponents of the possession game, remains to be seen. It looks a long way off right now despite the best efforts of Mainoo. Those patterns are not quite there in their game.",
      "For McGuinness, it brings to mind a comment from Danny Welbeck when the former Manchester United forward was on England duty.",
      "\"I remember him saying when he was in the squad with Marcus Rashford that even though he had not really played with him, they could connect easily because they were looking for the same things. That is why you need stability in a club.",
      "\"Clubs try to buy success but if you do not have a core of players who are on the same wavelength, you are not going to have success. That is why having homegrown players can be really useful because they have grown up together. The timing is right.",
      "\"That was a big feature with the Class of '92. In the last few years, Manchester United have not only been changing players and coaches but changing styles. That makes it really difficult. A player like Kobbie can keep that connection to the United style.\"",
      "The hope is that Kobbie Mainoo will define it over the next decade.",

      "Erik Ten Hag praises mentality and attitude of Man Utd players after late goals in normal time and extra time help them edge FA Cup quarter-final and book Wembley semi vs Coventry; Jurgen Klopp loses cool with TV reporter after \"very hard\" game for his Liverpool side amid \"intense season\"",
      "Monday 18 March 2024 15:36, UK",
      "Jurgen Klopp was ruffled by a reporter's \"dumb question\" after Liverpool lost an FA Cup epic to Manchester United, while counterpart Erik ten Hag declared that his side \"can beat anyone\" after their 4-3 win at Old Trafford.",
      "United knocked out their great rivals with the help of late goals in normal time and extra time to grab victory in a thrilling contest, setting up a semi-final with Coventry at Wembley.",
      "Klopp had been philosophical about coming out on the wrong end of an at-times wild contest when he took questions after the game.",

      "\"Congratulations to United, going to the semi-final. We have a game less, or have two games less, and we [will] try to use that in the next few weeks.\"",
      "But while Klopp was measured in his response to much of the media after his side's defeat, he had little time for a reporter from a Scandinavian TV network who questioned why Liverpool appeared to lose intensity in extra time.",
      "Below is a transcript of what was said between Klopp and Niels Christian Frederiksen. As a note, Liverpool have played 18 matches in 2024 to Man Utd's 12.",
      "Reporter: \"Normally intensity is the name of your game, so how come it became so difficult in extra time?\"",
      "Klopp: \"Bit of a dumb question, I have to say. We played I don't know how many games recently, I don't know how many games United exactly played. That's sport.",

      "Frederiksen has since given his reaction to the feisty exchange, insisting he understands Klopp's frustrations.",
      "\"I interpret it mostly as an expression of his terrible frustration that they lost to Manchester United in the manner it happened, where they were ahead twice and should have sealed the deal,\" Frederiksen told Danish sports magazine Tipsbladet.",
      "\"His dream scenario was to play an FA Cup final at Wembley in his last match in England, and that's been taken from him now. So I can understand he's super frustrated.",
      "\"Then he got a question he didn't think was appropriate. It's been a theme for them that they've had many injuries and many matches, which he has complained about. Then he got a question about why they didn't have intensity in the game, and then he snapped.",
      "\"That's fair enough. I have absolutely no problem with that. There will be absolutely no problems in the future. I can't imagine that at all.",
      "\"When I interview him again, we'll still be good friends - professionally speaking. I don't think he holds a grudge, and I certainly don't.\"",
      "Ten Hag refused to be drawn on whether it was his best win - \"I have had some more very good wins, I can tell you\" - but insisted the victory showed the capability of his team to overcome any challenge.",
      "\"This could be that moment where we get the belief, the energy that we can do amazing things,\" said Ten Hag. \"I think that if we can beat Liverpool the way we did, we can beat anyone.\"",
      "For the Dutchman, this display was a vindication of his repeated comments this season about the path his team are on.",
      "\"I've said for many weeks we have a team for the future that's very good,\" he told ITV. \"You can see the potential.\"",
      "Until the final minutes of the first half, when Liverpool, invited on, scored two in quick succession, United had been outstanding and played on the front foot. In extra-time, Ten Hag threw caution to the wind, taking off defenders for attackers and finishing with a backline of Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes and Antony.",
      "This was a win which owed plenty to his coaching and in-game decision-making, as well as the individual moments of quality from his players.",
      "He couldn't hide his satisfaction at how it had all paid off.",
      "\"The first 35 minutes I think was the best minutes from our season,\" Ten Hag told ITV.",
      "\"We were really there, acting as a team. But then gaps in between the lines and you can't allow this against Liverpool. Then they outplay you. And also after half-time, it continues.",
      "\"We had to change. We went into the risk, we went into one against one, and the players were wonderful - the mentality, the attitude was so great.",
      "\"They had strong belief to win this game. We went for it and we got it.\"",
