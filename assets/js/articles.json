      "Bryan Robson has told Marcus Rashford his mindset must shift if he wants to resurrect his Manchester United career. The 27-year-old is currently thriving in a season-long loan spell with Barcelona after tumbling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "At the Catalan club, Rashford has netted five times and provided seven assists in 13 appearances across all competitions so far. And while the attacker is rediscovering his spark under Hansi Flick, it might spell trouble for the player when the campaign concludes.",
      "Should Rashford make his way back to Old Trafford, there's no certainty he would earn a spot in Amorim's first team, despite enhanced displays on Spanish soil. But United icon Robson believes a change in his mentality would significantly help him reclaim his position with his childhood club.",
      "Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, Robson said: \"The thing is for me, Marcus lost his focus. Commentators annoy me a wee bit where they say that Marcus is enjoying his football and they were saying that at Villa. Well, when you look at it, he didn't do that well at Villa because he didn't score that many goals.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United. Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"So for a player like Marcus playing with the top players like Barcelona have, he will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United.",
      "\"I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Paul Scholes has also raised questions with regards to Rashford's attitude towards his parent club. Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football, the Red Devils and England legend said: \"I really struggle to feel happy for Marcus Rashford.",
      "\"Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful. The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave...His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace. I think he quit on Man Utd.",
      "\"When you quit once, you'll quit again. He was late last night [for Barcelona]. He wont get away with that for long at Barca. There's absolutely no chance. How can you sleep in these days? Your phone, f***ng alarm, whatever.",
      "\"How can you sleep in? He's definitely got the talent to be [one of the best players in the world]. But he'll never have the mentality.\"",
      "Manchester United are currently on a roll, even without the services of Rashford. The Red Devils, under the guidance of Amorim, have chalked up three consecutive victories in the Premier League, having bested Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Their next challenge is set for Saturday, as they head to the City Ground to face off against Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest. Despite their current sixth-place standing in the Premier League, a victory could potentially propel them to second, depending on other results.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has once again shown Manchester United what they're missing out on. The 28-year-old midfielder, who was snapped up by Napoli in August 2024 for a mere £25m, has had a cracking start to the season, helping Antonio Conte's side climb to the top of Serie A.",
      "He was instrumental in securing victory for the Italian heavyweights against Lecce on Tuesday night, coming off the bench to bag three huge points in the title race. Within moments of McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund coming on, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa finally broke the deadlock for Napoli.",
      "Although the Scotsman wasn't directly involved in the goal, his presence undoubtedly altered the game's dynamics. McTominay, who had an outstanding season last term, had found it challenging to replicate that impact this season but is now finding his form again.",
      "Anguissa is also making a splash in Italy, netting the match's only goal in the 69th minute after connecting with a superb cross from David Neres, heading the ball past Wladimiro Falcone. Napoli are now three points ahead of AC Milan in Serie A as they aim to retain their title as champions of Italy.",
      "Speaking to DAZN after the game, Conte downplayed Gli Azzurri's promising start to the campaign. The former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss dismissed claims that they're benefitting from injuries to Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne as 'completely absurd'.",
      "\"All we've got in goal now is [Vanja] Milinkovic-Savic, but some over the summer were asking why we had invested so much in a quality goalkeeper. [Noah] Lang had two knocks in the same spot, so I think his muscle hardened. It is not a serious problem.",
      "\"I am glad for him too, having his first start, as we need everyone in this difficult moment. The important thing is that we never lack the right spirit.\"",
      "Conte singled out Anguissa, who sits second in the league's scoring charts, whilst showering his squad with praise for their attitude. The Napoli boss said: \"These games are never easy, especially after a match like the one with Inter that used up so much energy.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"We played against a very good team. It is always tough to play here in Lecce. I think we should've controlled the final stages better, even if we didn't run many big risks - mentality is first and foremost.",
      "\"It was a very good first half, then this penalty could've changed the course of the game, but our goalkeeper did well and we went on to deserve the victory. I am very happy for Frank.",
      "\"If he's constantly switched on, then there are few players like him, but he still needs to improve his finishing. We need to score goals from everyone. It doesn't matter if they are strikers, midfielders or defenders.\"",
      "McTominay has made 11 appearances this season, netting four times, with his most important goal coming against Inter Milan just last weekend. The Scottish international doubled the lead for his team against the Nerazzurri, slotting home a perfectly timed half-volley.",
      "Following the match, McTominay commemorated the moment with a celebratory Instagram post, which rapidly surpassed 150,000 likes. Among the thousands of comments from fans, Bruno Fernandes left a classy message.",
      "\"Pazzesco [love heart eye emoji],\" wrote the United skipper, which translates to 'crazy' in English. McTominay will be aiming to maintain his 'crazy' form when Napoli face off against Como on Saturday afternoon.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly refusing to let Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee leave due to the potential impact of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) on their squad. Meanwhile, Jadon Sancho is expected to complete his loan spell at Aston Villa, with no break clause included in the deal from Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best spell since taking charge, with three consecutive league victories. Wins against Sunderland, arch-rivals Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion have put United just a point shy of the Champions League spots as November begins, with an opportunity to strengthen their European credentials against struggling Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "The summer signings of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo have significantly improved United's attacking prowess compared to last season. The Cameroonian international has scored three goals in two matches, Sesko found the net twice before the international break, and Cunha opened his account during the 4-2 victory over Brighton.",
      "However, United have been dealing with ongoing speculation about the futures of fringe players Zirkzee and Mainoo. Both have been linked with moves away from Old Trafford, with clubs such as West Ham United, Sevilla and Napoli reportedly interested.",
      "However, due to their players' participation in the upcoming AFCON, United bosses face some crucial decisions. One of these, as reported by the Daily Mail, is that Sancho won't be making a return to the club owing to the absence of a break clause in their agreement with Villa.",
      "Such a clause would have permitted United to recall him when the opportunity arose, much like with Sergio Reguillon when he departed the club mid-season on loan. However, other reports suggest that United will prevent exits for Zirkzee and Mainoo due to the squad's involvement in the tournament, which takes place from late December to early January in Morocco.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to join his Cameroon teammates, while Amad could receive a call-up for Ivory Coast. Consequently, it's been suggested that the January departures have been halted to avoid leaving the team short-staffed during a busy period.",
      "Amorim is set to face a selection dilemma during this time, with both players likely to miss consecutive home games against Newcastle and Wolves on 27th and 30th December respectively. Also included in their fixture list are matches against Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Leeds United, Burnley and Manchester City, along with the FA Cup third round at the start of the new year.",
      "Sancho, on the other hand, has had a challenging start to his loan spell at Villa Park. This weekend, he was brought on as a substitute in the first half, only to be taken off towards the end of their 1-0 victory over Manchester City.",
      "The 25 year old has struggled to make an impact at Unai Emery's side, managing only five appearances in all competitions, including just two Premier League games. It's now been suggested that he'll be staying put in the Midlands as there was no recall clause included in their loan agreement.",

      "Casemiro’s time at Manchester United has been a rollercoaster journey – and there is no doubt that the Brazilian is currently on the up. The experienced midfielder has been key to United’s three straight wins, starting alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park – and his influence extends well beyond the pitch.",
      "Casemiro has allayed fears about his lack of mobility to re-establish himself as the dependable presence in midfield that United thought they were signing for £70million in the summer of 2022. The 33-year-old’s sky-high £350,000-a-week wages have often been used as a stick with which to beat him, but he has managed to turn the tide through his performances.",
      "It is quite the turnaround for a player who looked surplus to requirements in the summer and was constantly linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. Rather than go and make even more money in the Middle East, Casemiro made it clear that he wanted to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "He has done just that, starting all but one of United’s Premier League matches this season while helping to solve Amorim’s biggest issue of the 2024/25 campaign. The Portuguese coach’s insistence on playing a 3-4-3 system created problems last season, with United’s two-man midfield constantly exposed.",
      "Yet Casemiro’s upturn in form has helped ease those fears, with £50m signing Manuel Ugarte and academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo stuck on the bench. Asked about his performances after Saturday's 4-2 win over Brighton, Amorim said: “I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "As you would hope from such an experienced player, who won five Champions League titles and numerous other trophies with Real Madrid, Casemiro is sharing his wisdom in the United dressing room. There have previously been suggestions that his English is limited, but that is no longer the case.",
      "The i says he’s called “Uncle Cas” by his team-mates, has formed a close bond with Matheus Cunha and takes it upon himself to speak to the younger players after training sessions, rather than just sticking to the Portuguese speakers. The fact he is willing to contribute so positively in the final year of his contract speaks volumes.",
      "Former United defender Rio Ferdinand has been particularly impressed, especially given Casemiro’s sidelining last season. Speaking about Amorim’s treatment of him, the ex-United star said on Rio Ferdinand Presents : \"That could have absolutely humiliated him, and it would have. Football players are intelligent in a football environment.",
      "\"They all smell where they are in the pecking order. So if Amorim's telling you that, every player in that squad would have known Casemiro is at the back of their pack, Toby's being called upon before him.",
      "\"Do you know how embarrassing that would have been for Casemiro? But for him to roll his sleeves up and say: 'ain't happening, you all know I'm better than him, you all know I'm the best holding midfielder at the club. Watch this space’.”",
      "Casemiro’s deal expires on June 30, but United have the option to extend it by 12 months. The idea they would do so appeared preposterous earlier this year. Now you wouldn’t bet against it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov has told Benjamin Sesko to get nasty if he wants to start scoring goals regularly at Manchester United - insisting he needs to be more demanding about the service he's receiving.",
      "The Slovenian was the club's most expensive summer signing, joining from RB Leipzig for £74million, but has endured a mixed start to life at Old Trafford. He is playing in a team that struggled in the opening weeks of the season, which didn't help his cause.",
      "Sesko's goal return has been a concern though with the 22-year-old only scoring twice in 10 outings thus far. His first strike came in the loss at Brentford before he notched against Sunderland the following week.",
      "More was expected though of the frontman, who has been hailed among the best young strikers in Europe, and Berbatov believes he needs to be more aggressive when it comes to demanding the ball.",
      "The Bulgarian was a Golden Boot winner during his time in Manchester and claims Sesko doesn't need to be \"polite and best friends and buddies\" with his team-mates if he's not getting the ball in scoring positions.",
      "Berbatov issued his advice to the Slovenian when asked on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"Be confident in yourself. Be arrogant in a way that you demand the ball from your team-mates when you make the run - and when you make a good run, if the ball doesn’t come for you, say it or express it in a way that your teammates will understand that, ‘I am here. I’m making the run for you. Respect my run. Not every time but try to see me and believe in what I can do with that run’.",
      "\"Sometimes be angry. Scream, swear at him, whatever. [It’s] not personal. Just in a way that I’m here, man. That’s why I’m here. Just give me the ball. Pass to me. I will try to score for you.",
      "\"Half-time, before and after the game, speak. Sometimes I think the players need to be more aggressive and emotional, in a way like, ‘Pass me the damn ball, man!\"",
      "United have trusted Sesko to lead their line after seeing several of their former strikers struggle to deal with the expectation. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both found it difficult to deliver last term, forcing United into the market.",
      "Ruben Amorim has eased Sesko into the fold, often leaving him on the bench and introducing him in the second-half, and he's confident the striker will come good.",

      "He said: \"I think the biggest challenge any manager faces is the magnitude of the club. Manchester United is a massive club. I think every bit of news, whether we think it's irrelevant, is big news when it concerns United. The manager’s job comes with a hell of a lot of pressure when you are the leader of United.\"",

      "With this stage lasting until December 31, Mbeumo will miss at least United's clashes with Newcastle and Wolves. Should Cameroon advance further, with the final taking place on January 18, he could be absent for at least three more matches, including the Manchester derby on January 17.",
      "It has been almost a year since head coach Amorim took over at Old Trafford and when he arrived, it became apparent that some of his forward options were not suited to his system.",
      "Marcus Rashford had been underperforming for Erik ten Hag and as the Dutch manager was relieved of his duties, Amorim did not see the English forward fit for his starting XI.",
      "In January, he was shipped out on loan to Aston Villa and is now starring for Barcelona, with any bridges back to Manchester essentially burned. Antony was another who was almost instantly axed by Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian cost a whopping £86m when he was bought from Ajax for Ten Hag and Amorim did not like what he saw when he arrived last November. He was also loaned out to Real Betis and left on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Against Brighton, it was a brilliant free-kick from former United striker Danny Welbeck that started off a short-lived resurgence and made it 3-1 in the second half. A Charalampos Kostoulas goal in added time made it 3-2 before Mbeumo settled the nerves with a clinching finish.",

      "Paul Scholes has doubled down on his belief that Jadon Sancho possesses the skill and ability to flourish as a top-tier Premier League talent - despite enduring one of the most embarrassing moments of his career during Aston Villa's clash with Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "The Manchester United winger, who spent the previous campaign on loan at Chelsea, joined Villa on a temporary deal during the summer transfer window. His time at Villa Park has been difficult so far, with the player yet to find the net or provide an assist across five outings.",
      "Following encouraging signs in the Europa League encounter against Go Ahead Eagles last Thursday, hopes were high that Sancho could build momentum when Villa took on Manchester City at the weekend.",
      "Despite starting the match on the substitutes' bench, Sancho failed to make any meaningful contribution once introduced into the action. After replacing the injured Emiliano Buendia during the first half, Sancho found himself withdrawn before the final whistle.",
      "The winger managed just 45 minutes on the pitch before being hauled off by manager Unai Emery. Sancho entered the fray in place of Buendia during the 29th minute before making way for Evann Guessand in the 74th minute.",
      "The England international has faced widespread mockery for being substituted as a substitute, although former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood and Scholes have come to his defence.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Sherwood said: \"I like the boy. I think he's got – I don't know him as a person – but I think he's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "Offering his assessment during Sherwood's evaluation of Sancho, Scholes responded: \"Loads of ability.\"",
      "Sherwood went on to say: \"He needs to do it on a regular basis. You know, on a consistent basis, and if he does that, I mean, he's good enough to play, you know, [at an] enormous amount of clubs.\"",
      "In his post-match briefing, Villa boss Unai Emery addressed the 'embarrassing' substitution of Sancho and the decision to bring Guessand on in his place.",
      "\"Yes, sure he's (Sancho) not happy but I did it before with Morgan Rogers, with Emiliano Buendia, with Leon Bailey, and he played 60 minutes on Thursday,\" Emery stated.",
      "\"Today when he (Buendia) was injured, my plan was maybe in case he (Sancho) was going to play 30 minutes, but I decided to play more and he played 45 minutes.",
      "\"But my plan was when he was swapped with Emiliano Buendia, the idea was maybe not playing all the minutes until the last moment. And I told him as well, he can feel it, it's embarrassing.",
      "\"Before Morgan, Emiliano Buendia and Leon Bailey, they felt the same when I subbed them, but it was not a punishment. And now it's not a punishment.",
      "\"He played 45 minutes, I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now he's not ready fit to play 90 minutes, 45 minutes is not easy enough for him and I am happy and of course, progressively he's coming better and better.\"",

      "The clubs share a crucial partner as they all attempt to regenerate historic grounds in world football. Foster + Partners are the firm behind designing Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 100,000 capacity hopes, with a timeline for completion of 2030 touted.",
      "But the global studio for sustainable architecture, urbanism, engineering and design is now getting work underway designing the new San Siro, per Mail Online. Fosters have been given the all-clear to build a new 71,500-seater San Siro with the current stadium to be knocked down.",
      "That could leave their hands full, and there are hopes that development could be complete by 2031, in time for the European Championship the following year. The report suggests that Fosters were in discussions with Birmingham City but felt their priorities were too focused elsewhere.",
      "United told their Fan Forum meeting earlier this month that they continue to work with Fosters, but with a caveat. \"The club relayed it is working collaboratively with Foster+ Partners as the master planner for the wider regeneration project and that no official appointment has been made for the engineering and construction contract for the new stadium build project,\" read the minutes.",
      "The Red Devils remain hopeful of securing a deal to purchase land surrounding Old Trafford for the project and told the latest fans’ forum meeting that ‘constructive discussions’ have taken place with Freightliner over acquiring it. The extra land behind Old Trafford is said to be critical to Lord Foster’s tent design.",
      "A United spokesperson said: \"Early design work has been intentionally paused until we have greater clarity on land assembly and fan requirements. As with other aspects of the project, we encourage fans to treat speculative media reports with caution.",
      "\"We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",
      "United have previously admitted that they can't deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone, and have been working closely with the government and Trafford Council. Both the club and the city region have a goal to bring significant fixtures to the stadium from the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2035.",

      "Cunha, who joined the Reds in a whopping £62.5million deal from Wolves over the summer, had a rocky start with the club. In fact, he didn't manage to score or assist in his first eight appearances and even missed a match due to a hamstring injury before the first international break.",
      "However, the 26-year-old star finally broke his goalless streak and netted his first for United in their 4-2 win against Brighton on Saturday. Cunha's first goal was a beauty, curling the ball from the edge of the box into the bottom corner, leaving goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen helpless.",
      "According to The Sun, Fernandes has played a crucial role in helping Cunha cope with the pressures of being a United player. Their shared Portuguese language has reportedly fostered a strong mentorship between the two.",
      "It's said that Fernandes and Cunha have been spending hours in extra training sessions, honing their skills on free-kicks and set pieces - and their close bond is beginning to show results on the pitch.",
      "Insiders at The Sun suggest that Fernandes' guidance has been instrumental in boosting Cunha's emotional control and confidence, particularly during the Brazilian's frustrating injury spell.",
      "Despite Cunha failing to find the net or provide an assist during the thrilling 2-1 triumph at Liverpool last Sunday, his performance caught the eye and hinted at his potential to become a genuine game-changer for United under new boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward did manage to get his name on the scoresheet against Brighton, with Amorim singing the praises of the former Wolves and Atletico Madrid ace - who bagged 17 goals in 36 outings last campaign - following the match.",
      "\"He was struggling. He can hide that, but I understand he's struggling,\" Amorim told the BBC. \"But he shows confidence in every moment of the game. I really love the way he defends. I know I'm a little bit basic on that, but it's not a surprise the way he responded at Anfield.",
      "\"It's not a surprise the way he played with the ball, but without the ball, he's improving. That is going to be massive for our team. He needs to score goals; he suffered when he didn't score, but he is a top player because he decides games, and I'm really pleased with him.\"",
      "Cunha and United return to action when the Red Devils make the trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday. They have the opportunity to climb as high as second in the standings with a fourth consecutive Premier League victory at the City Ground.",

      "Arsenal should have signed Bryan Mbeumo 'years ago' according to former Gunners star Theo Walcott. Manchester United are reaping the benefits of that failure.",
      "Mbeumo made a big-money move from Brentford to United over the summer, with the Red Devils footing up £71million for his services. The Gabon international has quickly looked to repay some of that fee with impressive early form at Old Trafford.",
      "The 26-year-old has bagged five goals in his first 10 appearances for United, coming off the back of a season where he struck 20 Premier League goals for Brentford. And Walcott reckons Ruben Amorim has signed a sure thing.",
      "Mbeumo has earned plenty of experience in the top-flight after joining Brentford as a 19-year-old in the Championship in 2019. The forward cost a club record fee of £5.8m, meaning the Bees earned a tidy profit having seen Mbeumo improve over the years.",
      "Ex-Everton and Southampton winger Walcott reckons another of his former clubs, Arsenal, should have had the foresight to do a deal sooner. The former England ace believes United have made a good move by signing Premier League talent amid competition from Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "\"You have Cunha coming back and defending as well and Mbeumo who I think is outstanding,\" said Walcott on It’s Called Soccer, \"You look at players away from the Premier League who come into the Premier League, they take time. These guys [like Mbeumo] were built for Premier League football.",
      "\"I think Mbeumo has been incredible and he’s a player Arsenal should have bought many years ago.\"",
      "Walcott believes Mbeumo could just be the tip of the iceberg, however, and that his team-mates are starting to find their way under Amorim. The 36-year-old claims that Amorim's system is finally starting to be understood by his squad.",
      "\"The team are understanding the way to play in his system now. When you have three at the back, you always have to have one of the centre-backs coming out into the midfield to be a third midfielder.",
      "\"Luke Shaw is that man doing that because he’s the one out of all the players that you trust to be able to cover as well. They need that if Bruno [Fernandes] and Cunha are going to work in the same team because I wasn’t so sure if they could really operate in the same team. It felt like two players that want to be in the same positions.",

      "Things are beginning to click for summer signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but there have been suggestions that United need to invest further in the next transfer window. While £200million was spent on attacking reinforcements in the summer, United missed out on midfield additions.",
      "Amorim has fielded Casemiro alongside Bruno Fernandes in central midfield in the past three games and the Portuguese manager wants new recruits. United reportedly have six names on a shortlist in midfield, including Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are said to be targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League this season. That would see United return to some form of European football, having missed out this season by finishing 15th and losing the Europa League final in 2024/25.",
      "United are reportedly keen to keep things how they are in January, which means that Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee may be prevented from leaving. That is partly due to Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui’s potential involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations in the New Year.",
      "United owners Ineos are reportedly quietly satisfied with the progress currently being made by Amorim and his coaching staff following another poor start to the season. With no European football, United have more time to prepare for each Premier League game and are now showing some consistency ahead of their game against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "“I think they are more confident,” Amorim said after the Brighton win. “I think the best game that we did this season was against Arsenal, was the first one. But then, when you are a little bit more confident, when you have a different spirit, sometimes you have a little bit [of] luck in certain moments of the game that help you to win games.",

      "Berbatov, who starred in the Premier League, also appearing for Fulham, told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"I was playing for CSKA Sofia and I was really starting to show my qualities. And normally, when you show your quality as a player, teams will come for you, submit offers, ask, you know, how long do you have as a contract, how much do you cost to buy, and stuff like this.",

      "\"He said, 'we will figure that out. Don't worry about it.' And the guys were sitting there and I’m just like this, you know, intimidated, of course. So maybe two, three hours sitting there, and in the end, the guy let me call my dad.",

So eventually someone calls someone, and the big bosses of the two teams figure out a way of me not moving, just staying where I was.",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Louis Saha has expressed his frustration with Marcus Rashford, despite the forward's impressive form at FC Barcelona. Rashford made his move from United to Barcelona on a season-long loan during the latest summer transfer window.",
      "After a stint at Aston Villa last season, Rashford was keen to leave Old Trafford and, finally, got his wish when he secured a switch to the Camp Nou. Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has netted five goals and provided seven assists, including one in their recent 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid in El Clasico, while his performances for the La Liga giants have drawn comments from Saha.",
      "\"I've always been a fan of Marcus Rashford; his quality is amazing. I was even jealous of his talent, and he's a nice guy,\" Saha told BetVictor.",
      "\"However, I don't like the narrative where a player leaves a club like Man Utd, and performs better elsewhere, and then blames United for previous struggles. As a professional, you need to find solutions, regardless of whether the manager likes you.",
      "\"We all face moments where we have to perform on the field. That wasn't his response.",
      "\"There were times I saw a player who was out of form, who didn't want to be there. That's not normal.",
      "\"It's not normal to play like that. You might want to request a transfer but, when you're out on the field, you work hard. He wasn't working hard, something was clearly wrong and he was unhappy.",
      "\"You shouldn't let anything take away your joy on the pitch, because you have a responsibility to your fans. It's not about the manager, or the club owners; it's about the thousands of people paying for tickets.",
      "\"I get angry because it feels like a waste. It shows a lack of accountability.",
      "\"Now, I'm very happy for him as a football player, not just for me, but for fans all over the world in Barcelona who can now enjoy a terrific player. But, of course, as a Manchester United fan, I'm angry.\"",
      "Rashford's future at United still remains uncertain, and the forward will be determined to add to his five goals for Barcelona across the rest of his loan spell. The next opportunity for Rashford to add to do so is this Sunday, when Barcelona take on Elche.",

      "Former Manchester United No.1 Andre Onana appeared to aim a subtle dig at his Old Trafford colleagues when reflecting on his start at Trabzonspor. The Cameroon international moved on loan to Turkey after falling out of favour with United and has enjoyed four straight wins with his new club.",
      "Trabzonspor sit second in the Super Lig with 23 points, picking up 13 of those in Onana's six outings between the sticks. While the move is only a loan at first, the ex-Inter Milan man could end up completing a permanent move in 2026.",
      "Certainly, Senne Lammens has impressed so far as he makes his case to remain United's first choice for the present and future. Onana, meanwhile, appears far happier with his current team-mates.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has praised Onana for his play with ball at feet on multiple occasions. Responding to that praise, the keeper pointed to the value his colleagues play in allowing him to take the approach he does.",
      "\"As I always say, most of the time, it’s my teammates who give me the options when I’m building up the game,\" he said, per Sporx (via Sport Witness). \"If they help me, the work looks much better.”",
      "The comments could be read as an implication that he didn't receive the same kind of help at United. While Onana came in for criticism for some high-profile errors unrelated to playing out from the back, United's defensive struggles were well documented.",
      "In Onana's two seasons between the sticks, the Red Devils conceded 58 and 54 goals respectively. They had only conceded more than 50 goals in two other seasons in the Premier League era, though one of those instances came in the 2021/22 campaign with some of the same defenders who are at the club now.",
      "Reflecting more widely on his approach, Onana said: “If I have to create a play, I analyse it first. Are the opponents pressing, are they pressing with their wingers, are they pressing with their strikers, or are their centre-backs coming forward?",
      "“These are the things I need to see when I have the ball. I watch how the opponents are moving and then I look at the options and make my decision. Of course, it’s always great to hear a comment like that from Pep Guardiola. He’s one of the best managers in the history of football.\"",
      "With just seven goals conceded in 10 games, Onana's Trabzonspor side boast one of the better defensive records in Turkey. His parent club have conceded 14 goals in their nine league games - three in three with Lammens in goal and 11 in six with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",

      "Brendan Rodgers picked a fight he could never win. Just like Sir Alex Ferguson did more than two decades ago.",
      "Because those who take on Irish businessman Dermot Desmond, tend to finish on the losing side. Just like Rodgers has now, having left Celtic with his managerial reputation in ruins.",
      "But no-one should be surprised how Desmond, the most powerful figure at Celtic, decided to unleash a brutal character assassination on Rodgers. Because Desmond doesn't suffer fools. Back in the Noughties, Desmond was a significant shareholder at Manchester United when he found himself embroiled in what became an infamous row between Fergie and fellow Irishman businessman John Magnier.",
      "The protracted and public dispute was over the ownership of stallion 'Rock Of Gibraltar'. Fergie had been given a half share of the horse, which went on to become a champion one.",
      "Fergie believed his share was worth more than what Magnier, and his Coolmore bloodstock empire, were willing to give him. The dispute, which started in 2003 when Fergie was managing United, resulted in Magnier putting pressure on the club, by questioning some of their past transfer dealings and agents involved in them.",
      "These included Fergie's son, Jason Ferguson. Ferguson launched legal proceedings, while United supporters protested against Magnier, and threatened to disrupt the Cheltenham Festival.",
      "But the dispute was resolved once Desmond agreed to act as peacemaker. Which resulted in Fergie getting a settlement much lower than what he had asked for. With help from Desmond, Magnier had won.",
      "Desmond gets what he wants, in the end. A fact Rodgers is now coming to realise.",
      "Desmond operates in the margins, with stealth. He is someone who believes business should be done with discretion. He makes all the big calls - and doesn't feel the need to have to explain them.",
      "But he has taken the unusual step of making an exception for Rodgers. Accusing the former Liverpool manager of speaking words which \"have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club, fuelling \"hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\"",
      "In short, whatever Rodgers has done, it has persuaded Desmond to go nuclear on him. It's difficult to see where Rodgers goes from here.",
      "He might even feel like taking legal action himself, just like Fergie did all those years ago. But then again, he might want to think long and hard about that.",

      "No sooner had Jadon Sancho been taken off the pitch during the Man City match than a flurry of comments flooded social media, suggesting the winger should feel embarrassed or that his career had reached a new nadir. Sadly, these extreme reactions were to be expected.",
      "Many outsiders were also prematurely anticipating a failed loan spell for Marcus Rashford months before it even kicked off. A dream transfer to Barcelona was next for forward, whose resurgence in form - thanks to his stint at Villa - can only enhance England's prospects of winning the World Cup next year.",
      "At present, Sancho is not at the same fitness level as Rashford was when he signed with Villa back in February, but this is a season-long loan. The 25-year-old still has ample time to demonstrate his worth.",
      "A quick scroll of social media indicates that Sancho has more than just Emery to impress. However, it's crucial he maintains a laser-like focus, like Rashford, concentrating on the task at hand and disregarding external pressures.",
      "Sancho had a chat with Rashford last season, with the former Villa loanee expressing his delight at finding himself again at a club willing to offer the platform he needed.",
      "Sancho's situation mirrors this closely, and he will be scrutinised intensely during his tenure at Villa - a fact not uncommon for any Manchester United player or one who has previously commanded a hefty transfer fee. Frankly, it's part and parcel of the job.",
      "Some things, however, need perspective - Sancho’s performance against City is one of them.",
      "Sancho was called into action in the 29th minute, replacing Emi Buendia who had suffered a foot injury shortly after setting up Matty Cash's goal.",
      "Operating from the left flank in his fifth loan appearance for Villa, Sancho nearly got on the scoresheet in the second half. A well-timed run onto Boubacar Kamara's lofted pass saw him leave Matheus Nunes trailing in his wake, before forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian shot-stopper was again called into action to deny the rebound.",
      "Just four minutes after almost doubling Villa's lead, Sancho made way for Evann Guessand, whose work rate off the ball was required at that stage of the match.",
      "Despite Sancho being brought on earlier than expected due to Buendia's injury, Unai Emery, like all top managers, prioritised the team's needs and made the necessary changes to secure victory.",
      "Guessand came on, along with Ross Barkley who replaced John McGinn. Both substitutes performed admirably, easing pressure on the defence and fulfilling their roles - much like Sancho did during his 45-minute stint.",
      "Naturally, no player wants to be subbed off after coming on as a substitute, but Emery's intention was always to give Sancho some game time. It just so happened that his introduction came sooner than planned.",
      "In fact, there have been nine other occasions when Emery has 'subbed the sub', with Morgan Rogers, Leon Bailey, Moussa Diaby, and Buendia among them. Did anyone really bat an eyelid when those substitutions were made?",
      "Villa beat Man City at home for a third successive season. Sancho played his part, is looking sharper and fitter, yet the narrative was predictably polarising - yearning for an instant reaction before Emery had even shaken Guardiola's hand or spoken at the press conference.",
      "Asked about the substitution, Emery said: \"It was not easy, firstly, after Sancho played 60 minutes against Go Ahead. He is getting fit, but not enough.",
      "\"I planned as well with him to play him in the second half, but after the injury to Buendia, I decided to get him on the field as best as possible to get minutes and fitness, using his skills and qualities.",
      "\"His impact was good, but I knew before that it was my plan was to sub him, and I did it before with Morgan Rogers and Emi Buendia.",
      "\"It was not a punishment, it was a plan - he played 45 minutes. The other sub players were ready. Malen, Maatsen and Barkley were all very good.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has revealed the genuine sentiments of numerous Manchester United stars regarding former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The Norwegian helmed United for three years, with displays arguably as reliable as any manager had achieved since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "Throughout his reign, United secured top four finishes on two occasions and reached the Europa League final, though they suffered heartbreak in that decisive encounter against Villarreal. A 4-1 loss to Watford just months afterwards proved his final match in the dugout, with United appointing five high-profile figures since his departure.",
      "Since earning his breakthrough under Louis van Gaal, Rashford has worked with eight different bosses, and his latest remarks indicate his finest period arrived under Solskjaer's guidance.",
      "\"Ole is a fantastic person,\" he confessed to TV2. \"I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him.",
      "\"We played good football under Ole. It was a very successful period for me personally. He is a fantastic person, and I don't have a bad word to say about him.\"",
      "When questioned whether he maintains contact with the former Besiktas and Molde boss, he responded: \"Yes, from time to time, but it's been a while now.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag and current gaffer Ruben Amorim are the only two permanent appointments since then, with Rashford experiencing contrasting relationships under both.",
      "Under Ten Hag, the 27-year-old was a force to be reckoned with, playing a pivotal role in United's domestic cup victories.",
      "Rashford netted three times in as many games following Amorim's arrival, but he was later omitted from the first-team squad after a falling out with United's new boss.",
      "A successful loan stint at Aston Villa came about that January, while United suffered their worst season ever.",
      "Despite not being reintegrated into the squad, Rashford seemed set for a permanent exit last summer, but instead secured a dream move - albeit temporarily - to Barcelona. The transfer does include a £30million buy-option.",
      "While a decision is unlikely to be made until next year at the earliest, it seems highly likely he will become a permanent signing.",
      "This is because he has racked up 10 goal contributions in as many matches this season, with his latest contribution being an assist in the El Classico defeat to Real Madrid last weekend.",

      "Manchester United will not have been surprised to see reports that Joshua Zirkzee wants to leave the club in the January transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport understands Zirkzee is anxious for more playing time ahead of the World Cup, and his concerns are justified. The Dutchman featured at Euro 2024 but has not been called up for the Netherlands since November last year.",
      "For his club, Zirkzee has yet to start this season, and his cameo against Brighton did little to change that status. The 24-year-old lost his marker for the away side's second of the game and was largely anonymous spearheading the attack.",
      "It is clear the forward is not in Ruben Amorim's plans at the club. However, there is a consensus that United would not be willing to let him leave in January.",
      "The mid-season market is difficult for clubs wanting to sign replacements, and if Zirkzee were to leave, there is a theory that United would be short in cover. But there are three reasons which prove why the Reds should sanction the transfer.",
      "Firstly, United have a player coming through their ranks who could slip into the role of cover immediately. Chido Obi has earned praise since making the move to Old Trafford from Arsenal and was a back-up last season for United.",
      "This year, he has managed to continue his development in the academy and scored on Tuesday night in the young Reds' win against Rochdale's first-team. More exposure to the first-team environment at United will only be beneficial for the 17-year-old and it won't necessarily affect his game time for the academy either.",
      "And that is where the second reason comes in. Obi may not be called upon often thanks to the success of the strikerless system in recent weeks.",
      "Against Liverpool, Matheus Cunha leading the line with Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo behind him, caused Arne Slot's team multiple problems. If it had not been for Mount's knock, we may have seen these three feature together against Brighton.",
      "Clearly that system works and currently, this option is ahead of Zirkzee starting. The final reason in favour of sanctioning the transfer request would be to help Zirkzee.",
      "This is a player who struggled tremendously in his first season and was unfairly targeted during a disappointing loss to Newcastle over Christmas 2024. To his credit, he knuckled down and his performances since that day improved.",
      "Zirkzee is no longer part of the plans though and Amorim should do right by him and allow him to leave.",

      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey has trained this week, despite suffering a knock last weekend.",
      "Lacey was a notable absentee from the Under-21 squad to face Rochdale on Tuesday night.",
      "The 18-year-old received treatment for a shoulder injury during the U21s' win against Tottenham last Saturday. He was replaced in the 65th minute and was spotted holding ice to the area while on the bench.",
      "However, Lacey is understood to be fine after the knock and has trained normally this week. The Liverpool-born lad is seen as a high-potential talent and United did not risk him to face Rochdale as a precaution.",
      "Lacey is pushing to make a first-team debut this season. The youngster has long been considered one of the best talents in the academy and has starred for the U21s during this campaign.",
      "Earlier this month, Lacey was drafted into England senior training by Thomas Tuchel to supplement the session. He was named in England's Under-20 squad for the October international break and was given the opportunity to train with the Three Lions' first-team at St. George's Park.",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years because followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",
      "The youngster was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",

      "The Manchester United boss made two changes on Saturday to the team that performed so well at Anfield a week earlier. One was enforced as the injured Harry Maguire was replaced by Leny Yoro, while Amorim opted to bring Benjamin Sesko in as the focal point of the attack having moved back to a striker-less system at Liverpool.",
      "The changes did little to halt United's momentum, and the challenge now is to keep the ball rolling and make it four wins in a row against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "Amorim will likely continue with Sesko as the spearhead of the attack, and although the head coach said last week that he hoped to have Maguire back against Forest, it would be unwise to throw him straight back into the XI after a short spell on the sidelines.",
      "Everything points to an unchanged team, but Amorim should consider making at least one alteration.",
      "Diogo Dalot has started all of United's previous four games since returning from injury, seeing out the full 90 minutes in all bar one of those outings.",
      "While Amorim's 3-4-3 system relies on wing-backs who can provide an attacking threat, the United boss knows he can't afford to leave his backline exposed, and so he tends to choose a more attack-minded option on one side with the balance of a more defensive option on the opposite flank.",
      "Dalot has been his go-to defensive option in recent weeks, and while the team have been playing well, Dalot has struggled.",
      "The Portugal international doesn't provide enough quality in the final third when presented with a chance to get forward, and he's also struggled defensively at times. United's winning run has meant his performances have gone somewhat under the radar, and a change is needed before he costs United.",
      "A right-back by trade, it must be acknowledged that Dalot has often been playing out of position on the left, a position Noussair Mazraoui filled in at on multiple occasions last season.",
      "The former Bayern Munich defender has suffered a couple of knocks this term that have limited his playing time, but he has made the last two matchday squads without being introduced from the bench.",
      "He was one of United's most consistent performers in his first season at the club, and while he is unlikely to unpick defences with attacking guile, he will provide the defensive solidity United need, allowing Amad to provide the threat on the opposite side.",

      "Chido Obi nonchalantly celebrated after scoring against Rochdale on Tuesday night.",
      "Rochdale attempted to play out from the back, Jim Thwaites won the ball and Obi reacted quickly to finish intelligently in the box, firing Manchester United's Under-21s into an early lead.",
      "Obi didn't show any emotion as he glared at the home fans at the Crown Oil Arena. The youngster was all business because scoring academy goals is second nature to him. They are as often as hot dinners.",
      "There was a minute's silence held before the game after the passing of Rhys Bennett's father. The players wore black armbands as a mark of respect and Bennett watched from the terraces with his family.",
      "Bennett has been granted compassionate leave and United are offering pastoral care to the youngster.",
      "The U21s began their National League Cup campaign against Tamworth in August. That game was abandoned after a Sekou Kone head injury, and Travis Binnion's side lost against Brackley in September.",
      "United needed to bounce back in the competition against Rochdale, who had made wholesale changes to their team due to their focus on securing promotion back to the Football League.",
      "Obi was asked for a photograph by a young fan when he stepped off the coach. The 17-year-old made seven appearances in the Premier League last season but has exclusively played in academy fixtures this term.",
      "United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town and there is no European football, so there are fewer first-team opportunities for academy prospects.",
      "Obi must be patient and keep scoring goals for the U21s to earn the first-team involvement. He will force his way into the squad again by the end of the season if he continues to score at a rate of knots.",
      "And although Obi opened the scoring within 10 minutes against Rochdale, it was Thwaites who was the standout performer, catching the eye in midfield with his dynamic range of passing.",
      "Thwaites has a name fitting of a player from a bygone era. His technical ability on the ball would probably make him seem like an alien if he were teleported to the 1940s, though.",
      "The Bolton-born lad only seems to have one setting: to pass the ball forward. He sprayed it around the pitch and slipped through Bendito Mantato down the right wing just before the interval.",
      "Thwaites is a dead-ball specialist, which may help him progress to the first-team, as set-pieces have suddenly become fashionable again in the Premier League in the last 18 months.",
      "United were value for their one-goal advantage by half-time. Rochdale had not threatened goalkeeper William Murdock between the sticks and Binnion would have been delighted with the performance.",
      "Obi is a goal machine at academy level and his finishing prowess is impressive, but he needs to improve his out-of-possession work, his pressing and link-up play with his teammates.",
      "Godwill Kukonki started for the U21s for the first time this season. Kukonki has been involved with first-team training sessions and acquitted himself well on the left side of central defence.",
      "Diego Leon scored his first goal for United last weekend and he is gradually finding his feet after his summer move from Paraguay. Leon delivered another competent display before being replaced on the hour mark.",
      "The U21s won 1-0 against Rochdale when they visited the Crown Oil Arena last year, and they went one better this time around thanks to a late goal from James Scanlon during injury time.",
      "United thoroughly deserved the three points and are now up and running in the National League Cup",

      "Ngwashi missed the start of the 2025/2026 season due to a minor injury but is now fully fit.",
      "The youngster's passing ability is exceptional and he's a ball-playing defender who is a huge asset to build-up play. His stature is impressive and he is considered a potential future star.",
      "Ngwashi has already represented Italy and England at youth level, although he will not have to pledge his allegiance to a nation until later in his career. He represented England's Under-17s in February.",

      "Making wholesale changes to the squad in the mid-season window is rarely a good idea, especially given the inflated price tags that come with the January market, and so United will wait until next summer to address their midfield issues.",
      "Casemiro has been much more reliable for United this season, but he is out of contract at the end of the campaign, by which point he will be 34. MEN Sport understands the Brazilian could be offered a new deal on reduced terms, but United would be wise to cut ties and look for a long-term solution.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has not done enough to suggest he can be trusted as United's first-choice defensive midfielder, and so it's down to the club to ensure the right man is brought in.",
      "Ruben Amorim has spoken a number of times about how he looked to target Premier League proven players in his first summer transfer window with the club, and the impact made by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha suggests the United boss would be wise to stick to that plan next year.",
      "The attacking duo have both proven themselves to be brilliant signings for Amorim. That's not to say that players arriving from foreign leagues can't excel at United - look at the impact Senne Lammens has made - but players with Premier League pedigree definitely carry less of a risk than those who haven't experienced the intensity of the league.",
      "United can't afford to sign a midfield player who takes time to adapt to the league. And so Adam Wharton looks to be an obvious target.",
      "He already knows the Premier League and has proven himself at Crystal Palace. He also offers United versatility in the centre with his ability to play as either the No.6 or No.8, which could be crucial if injuries start to bite.",
      "Wharton also plays in a 3-4-3 system at Palace and so he wouldn't need time to adapt to a change in formation.",
      "No signing comes without a certain degree of risk attached, but Wharton has shown he has the quality to play at the highest level and knows what to expect from the Premier League.",
      "He seems an obvious choice.",

      "\"Obviously they have been going through a tough time, the past couple of years but they have stuck with the gaffer and the past four or five games you’re really starting to see how Manchester United should be playing - that grit and that determination to play for the badge.

      "Before their defeat to Forest in December 2023, United had been on an 11-game winning run against this weekend's opponents which was spread over nearly 20 years as the East Midlands club dropped out of the Premier League.",

      "Bryan Robson has told Marcus Rashford that his attitude has to change if he is to return to Manchester United. The 27-year-old is currently enjoying a fruitful season-long loan with Barcelona as a result of falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the Catalan giants, Rashford has scored five goals and set up a further seven from 13 games across all competitions thus far. And while the forward is enjoying a new lease of life under Hansi Flick, it could be bad news for the star come season's end.",
      "While Barcelona hold a £28million option to buy the England international when his loan deal comes to an end next summer, they may not choose to exercise it. That's given they already have incredible stars on either flank in Raphinha and Lamine Yamal, as well as stiff competition for places.",
      "Should Rashford return to Old Trafford, there's no guarantee that he would make his way into Amorim's starting XI, despite improved performances on Spanish soil. However, United legend Robson believes that a shift in his attitude would go a long way in helping him find his place with his boyhood club once more.",
      "Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, Robson said: \"The thing is for me, Marcus lost his focus. Commentators annoy me a wee bit where they say that Marcus is enjoying his football and they were saying that at Villa. Well, when you look at it, he didn't do that well at Villa because he didn't score that many goals.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United. Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"So for a player like Marcus playing with the top players like Barcelona have, he will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United. I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has also raised questions with regards to Rashford's attitude towards his parent club. Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football, the Reds and England legend said: \"I really struggle to feel happy for Marcus Rashford.",
      "\"Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful.",
      "\"The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave...His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace. I think he quit on Man Utd.",
      "\"When you quit once, you’ll quit again. He was late last night [for Barcelona]. He wont get away with that for long at Barca. There’s absolutely no chance. How can you sleep in these days? Your phone, f***ng alarm, whatever.",
      "\"How can you sleep in? He’s definitely got the talent to be [one of the best players in the world]. But he’ll never have the mentality.\"",
      "It comes as United are seemingly thriving without Rashford at present. Amorim is currently enjoying a three-match winning streak in the Premier League, courtesy of wins over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Their next fixture lands on Saturday, when they travel to the City Ground to take on Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest. While they currently sit sixth in the Premier League standings, a win there could see them climb as high as second, dependent on other results.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will reportedly not sanction exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee due to the threat of losing their players to the African Cup of Nations (AFCON). Meanwhile, Jadon Sancho is set to see out his loan agreement with Aston Villa following reports that there is no break clause as part of the move from Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is on his best run since taking over at the helm after three successive league wins. Triumphs over Sunderland, rivals Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion mean that United are now sitting one point outside of the Champions League places going into November, with the chance to further assert themselves as European contenders against strugglers Nottingham Forest, this weekend.",
      "The summer arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo have helped the club move past their attacking problems last season. The Cameroon international has three in two games, Sesko netted two in as many games before the international break and Cunha got off the mark during the 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "But United have faced increasing speculation in recent months surrounding out-of-favour players, Zirkzee and Mainoo. Both have been the topic of links with a move away from Old Trafford as the likes of West Ham United, Sevilla and Napoli have been mooted.",
      "However, as a result of their players' involvement in the forthcoming AFCON, key decisions await United chiefs. One of which, according to the Mail, is that Sancho will not be returning to the club due to a lack of break clause in their agreement with Villa.",
      "Such a clause would have allowed United to recall him when the time had become available, similarly with Sergio Reguillon when he left the club in the middle of the season-long loan. But reports elsewhere suggest that United will block exits for Zirkzee and Mainoo due to the squad involvement in the competition, which runs from late-December to early Janaury, in Morocco.",
      "Mbeumo is set to unite with his Cameroon teammates, while Amad could be in line for an Ivory Coast call-up. As a result, it has been claimed that the January exodus has been blocked to avoid finding themselves short during a hectic period.",
      "Amorim faces a selection headache in that period with both players certain to miss back-to-back home matches against Newcastle and Wolves on December 27 and 30, respectively.",
      "Also in their cluster of fixtures is clashes against Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Leeds United, Burnley and Manchester City, with the FA Cup third round to come at the turn of the year.",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, has endured a tough start to his loan spell at Villa Park. This weekend, he was introduced as a substitute in the first-half before he was withdrawn in the dying embers of their 1-0 win over Manchester City.",
      "The 25-year-old has been plagued during his time in Unai Emery's side as he has mustered just five appearances in all competitions, two of which in the Premier League.",
      "Now, it has been claimed that he will remain in the Midlands after no break clause was included in their loan agreement.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim inspired Bryan Mbeumo and Amad's celebration during the 4-2 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday evening.",
      "Mbeumo scored a brace at the weekend during an impressive display from the Reds. Following his first goal which made it 3-0, the Cameroonian was spotted doing a dance with his Ivorian teammate.",
      "At the time, this seemed to be a celebration which was planned by the duo in advance. It now appears their inspiration came from their manager.",
      "Eagle-eyed fans have since noticed that Amorim performed the celebration for Benfica during a victory over Porto while he was an active player. While the dance was slightly different, it was noticeably similar.",
      "The link-up play between Mbeumo and Amad in recent matches has been a pleasure to watch for United supporters. Amad was the provider for Mbeumo at Anfield a couple of weeks ago and the winger has since admitted that it took them a little time to get on the same page.",
      "\"At the beginning, because he was a new player, we were trying to understand each other,\" Amad explained to MUTV. \"But now we find a solution: when he goes to right wing-back, I go as a No.10. When he plays as a No.10, I stay as a right wing-back.",
      "\"I think now we have a very good relationship, even outside the pitch. This is very important, not only to have a good relationship in the pitch, but also to have a good relationship outside the pitch, to put some things [together].",
      "\"A player has to be ready to play every position. I'm just here to give my best every game.",
      "\"If Bryan plays No.10, I am so happy and, if I play No.10, I'm so happy. But, for me, the most important thing is helping the team. If we win, we are very happy.",
      "\"It's nice. We've got good players and big talents. We knew already that Bryan, with Brentford, what he did with them was big things. So we tried to bring him here to do the same and he is doing the same.",

      "The clubs share a vital partner as they all seek to transform historic venues in world football. Foster + Partners is the firm behind Sir Jim Ratcliffe's vision for a 100,000-seater venue, with completion targeted for 2030.",
      "However, the global studio specialising in sustainable architecture, urbanism, engineering and design is now commencing work on designing the new San Siro, according to the Mail Online, as quoted by the Mirror. Foster has received approval to build a new San Siro, with the existing stadium set to be demolished.",
      "This development could stretch their resources thin, with hopes that construction could finish by 2031, ready for the European championships the following year. The report indicates that Fosters held talks with Birmingham City but felt their priorities lay elsewhere.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "United informed their Fan Forum meeting earlier this month that they remain in partnership with Fosters, albeit with a caveat. As quoted by the Mirror, a United spokesperson said: \"The club relayed it is working collaboratively with Foster+ Partners as the master planner for the wider regeneration project and that no official appointment has been made for the engineering and construction contract for the new stadium build project.\"",
      "The Reds remain optimistic about securing a deal to purchase land surrounding Old Trafford for the project and told the latest fans' forum meeting that 'constructive discussions' have been held with Freightliner regarding its acquisition.",
      "The additional land behind Old Trafford is deemed crucial to Lord Foster's tent design. A United spokesperson said: \"Early design work has been intentionally paused until we have greater clarity on land assembly and fan requirements.",
      "\"As with other aspects of the project, we encourage fans to treat speculative media reports with caution. We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",
      "United have previously conceded that they can't deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone and have been collaborating closely with the government and Trafford Council. Both the club and the city region share a goal to host significant fixtures at the stadium during the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2035.",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has shared an update on his recovery from injury after a heartbreaking Manchester United setback earlier this year.",
      "The eldest son of the United legend hopes to emulate his father's incredible career, but he suffered an injury setback, stating: 'Life couldn't get any worse.'",
      "The youngster clearly has his father's passion for the game and has impressed for United's youth sides this season. He caughgt the eye during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament in which his father also shone as a youngster at Everton.",
      "Kai was in the midst of a meteoric rise, having been called up to United's Under-19s side, where he competed against professionals four-years older than him.",
      "Prior to that call-up, he'd scored an incredible goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that nestled in the top corner, reminiscent of some of his father's brilliant strikes.",
      "Earlier this year, Kai shared an image on social media of his right foot in a boot, but has now updated fans on his recovery.",
      "Taking to Instagram, he shared two photos enjoying some down time in Dubai, with his foot no longer in a protective boot. The youngster captioned the pictures: \"Recovering\" followed by an emjoi shrowded in smoke.",
      "It's still unclear the exact nature of his injury, though the images suggest a return to action may not be too far away.",
      "The youngster tends to operate in a central attacking role, like his father Wayne, but can also play on either side of the attack.",
      "When asked about his son's football, in an interview with BBC Sport, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",

      "As reported over the weekend, Zirkzee is set to request a transfer away from United in the upcoming window, with West Ham United leading the race to provide the Dutch international an exit route from his Old Trafford woes. The 24-year-old managed to net just seven goals in 49 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "This season, he has featured only four times, with his most recent league goal for United dating back to December, 10 months ago. While Mainoo has also been linked with a midseason move away from the Reds.",

      "The former Manchester United winger was visibly frustrated when Enzo Maresca replaced him with Estevao in the 58th minute. After scoring the opening goal inside four minutes, Garnacho believed he had more to offer before Chelsea went on to lose 2-1.",
      "Maresca's decision sparked backlash from Chelsea fans on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).",
      "One said: \"Garnacho was probably the only attacker having a decent game … so of course he’s the first one Maresca subs off. No wonder he was shaking his head,\" while another posted: \"Maresca taking out the attacker who was most likely to score today in Garnacho was not the move.\"",
      "A third continued: \"Maresca makes terrible substitutions. Why take off Garnacho so early?\"",
      "Garnacho celebrated his goal by sitting on the advertising hoarding, joined by team-mate Pedro Neto. The moment served as a reminder for United fans - a similar celebration took place during their win over West Ham in February 2024 when Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund struck the same pose.",
      "At the time, the trio were seen as the future of United. But Garnacho later completed the £40million move to Stamford Bridge while Hojlund is also expected to leave Old Trafford, having shown positive signs following a loan move to Napoli.",

      "Mbeumo scored twice on Saturday as United made it three wins in a row. United took a 2-0 lead into half-time and looked home and hosed when Mbeumo made it 3-0 after the break. However, a nervy finish was in store after Danny Welbeck's free kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header in added time.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up to seal the victory late in the game, meaning he now has five goals since his move to United. Cunha's strike was just his first for the club and Mbeumo admitted it was a relief for the Brazilian to get off the mark. \"Yeah, of course the pressure is off his shoulders today with the goal, he was waiting for it and we were waiting for it as well,\" he explained.",
      "\"We are very happy for him. We are growing the link-ups between each other [himself, Sesko and Cunha].",
      "\"It hasn’t been easy obviously because we all came this year and we tried to make the connections in training. It hasn’t been easy coming into this environment, a big club, the expectations are not easy to handle but with the teammates, everyone is helping me, helping the team, helping the new players and I think that was very important.\"",
      "When asked whether he could match the 20 goals he scored in the last campaign, Mbeumo said: \"I always try to aim big in everything that I do. I try not to set limits on myself and on what I can reach. I am just going to work on that as much as possible.",
      "United's win moved them up to fourth and Mbeumo is optimistic for the future. \"Everyone wants to fight for as high as possible,\" he said.",
      "\"We want to win as many games as we can and that is what we are going to try and do.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba joked that he was 'coming to Old Trafford' on social media prior to Manchester United's 4-2 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "While the post was deleted, the impact of it perhaps lingered as the Cameroonian's hour at Old Trafford played out. At 21, there is plenty of room for improvement but that possible United transfer will need to be put on hold for now.",
      "Baleba was the player United fans had their eye on in the opposition ranks but he struggled. Bryan Mbeumo gave him a torrid time and when the midfielder unleashed a wayward shot in the second half, Fabian Hurzeler knew it was time to make a change.",
      "With Baleba not being the £100m man that Brighton hoped he would be at Old Trafford, his exit allowed another player to catch the eye in the form of Yankuba Minteh. When the 21-year-old left Newcastle in 2024, eyebrows were raised considering he had only been at St James' Park for a year.",
      "During that 12 months he was loaned to Feyenoord so Newcastle supporters did not get to see his potential. Eddie Howe may have been kicking himself had he watched Minteh's display at Old Trafford.",
      "He showed what he could do early in the first half as he turned the normally unflappable Leny Yoro inside out, before just running out of room. However, he continued to be positive and direct, proving to be the main source of all that was good about Brighton's play.",
      "In the second half, he switched to the right-hand side but was no less effective, providing a stern test for Ayden Heaven. When he broke down the middle, Patrick Dorgu was in trouble and was very fortunate to see the winger take a slightly heavy touch.",
      "Minteh and Danny Welbeck were arguably the two Brighton players who did not deserve to be on the losing side at Old Trafford.",
      "Would Minteh fit into the United system? Potentially. He is young and you could see him playing a similar role to Amad or Mbeumo.",
      "Should United pay £100m for him? Almost certainly not, especially as that position is well stocked at present and it may not take that much to sign Minteh anyway. But the winger showed Baleba the level you need to be at to earn that United move.",
      "Yes, one is a forward and the other a defensive midfielder, but Minteh played with the freedom that his teammate did not.",
      "Instead of being overawed by the occasion, Minteh relished it, and United would not go wrong looking at him in the future.",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher and Jay Bothroyd have disagreed on the decision not to award Manchester United a penalty in the first half of their 4-2 win over Brighton on Saturday.",
      "United continued their fine run of form under Ruben Amorim with another emphatic display at Old Trafford. The Reds raced into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo before the Seagulls pegged them back.",
      "The wing-back seemed to be clipped by Maxim De Cuyper, but referee Anthony Taylor was quick to wave away any claims for a spot-kick. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre account on X read: \"The referee’s call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "In the aftermath of the game, both Gallagher and Bothroyd debated a host of controversial refereeing decisions, including Amad's incident. However, they were unable to reach an agreement.",
      "Bothroyd said: “This is a definite penalty for me. Amad Diallo is running into the box. There is the slightest touch.",
      "“The defender, he puts his leg out, so obviously he has made contact. He touched the ball slightly, but that contact, has stopped Amad getting to the ball.",
      "“So whether he has touched the ball or not, and it’s a miniscule that he has touched that, because the ball is basically travelling in the same direction, he has stopped Amad getting to that. That’s why I would say that is a penalty.",
      "“It’s the same as [Viktor] Gyokeres, again the smallest touch. These touches are not enough to say, ‘Oh he has touched the ball. It can’t be a penalty,’ because players can still get back to the ball. That’s why I would say the Amad one is a penalty.”",
      "Gallagher, who spent over 15 years refereeing at the top level, disagreed with Bothroyd and pointed to previous incidents as to why the decision was made.",
      "He said: “It’s interesting we have seen Gyokeres with Pope, we saw Saka with Kevin and we’ve seen this one, they’ve been consistent - if they get a touch on the ball, they are not going to give a penalty, they’ve done it for week six, week eight and week nine.\"",
      "Bothroyd then replied: “But they did not do it for week five when Sanchez touched the ball and Mbeumo goes through. So they’ve changed the rule after week five is basically what you are saying.",
      "Gallagher then said: “I didn’t say that at all. I said since the Gyokeres one where they came out and said, ‘He’s got a touch on the ball.’ In this situation, they have been consistent, as you’ve asked for, and they haven’t given any of them.”",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "*Quiet at the back!",
      "Arsenal – can’t criticise them for not winning it (note, not ‘bottling’) and then criticise them for trying to win it however they so desire. Will they even concede another goal?! I think they finally do win it, and people still complain. Hey Stewie!",
      "Bournemouth – selling that vast majority of their defence seems like a bold strategy that’s paying off. They’re pretty good at finding players, aren’t they?! Will fade a little, but I think a European spot may beckon.",
      "Spurs – Hang on!?! How are they 3rd? Fair play. Does the away from crack before the home form improves? They will finish 7th. Does Solanke have a chant to The Police’s ‘So Lonely’?",
      "Sunderland – Uh, have you not got the ‘please relegate yourself imposter’ memo? Xhaka the signing that’s made the biggest impact thus far. Will stay up comfortably. Possibly half way to the tally they need to do so. Hearing Isidor’s name always makes me want to watch Lord of the Rings. I know, I know, it’s Isildur.",
      "Man City – They’re just not quite them, are they. Their ‘title challenge’ will see them 4/5 points off all the way through.",
      "Man Utd – No jokes here. Definite strides being made. It just feels like that fragility (and an Amorim meltdown) could return at any time still. At the moment.",
      "Liverpool – Was a curious summer with some seemingly unnecessary signings. More bumps in the road to come (early CL exit) before steadying improvement post Jan. Won it last year, so it could be Wirtz.",
      "Aston Villa – The greasy breakfast seems to have finally allowed the hangover to be shaken off. Tielemans can’t come back soon enough. Win the Europa League and nothing else matters. Won’t do in Spurs style if they do, however.",
      "Chelsea – Champs League games (where they actually have to play a decent XI) taking a toll? I can see up and down season in store. Really though, I just don’t care either way. Which is a weird thing to say. Is Maresca the distinctly average one?",
      "Crystal Palace – Rightly lauded and yet somehow still sit 10th. It’s a skill really. Could see another cup win. Excellent fans.",
      "Brentford – Oh, Keith. Keith, Keith, Keith… Just stop it! Take your first management job from a fella who’d been there a while and was loved, lose your best forward players, and don’t give a shit. Excellent work you likeable so-and-so.",
      "Newcastle – It feels fine, and sort of is. But is it? Will report back later.",
      "Brighton – Same as it ever was. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Cause the big boys trouble, look average elsewhere.",
      "Everton – A shiny stadium and a fun Jack Grealish. Just enjoy it all. No danger whatsoever.",
      "Leeds – Home form will dictate everything, and they will need 25+ points from their home games.",
      "Burnley – See above. Winning at Wolves doesn’t count.",
      "Fulham – Maybe try going to back to the mid table obscurity thing. This doesn’t look great. Will beat Arsenal at the Emirates just to get everyone jittery.",
      "Forest – The admiration and good graces of fans of other teams thrown away in the space of a few months. Almost impressive. I don’t like saying it, but I don’t think I’d be upset to see them relegated.**",
      "West Ham – ‘I’m addicted to you, don’t you know that I’m Toxic’. It looks bleak. Very bleak. Get out Jarrod. Get out! Villa Park is nice.",
      "Wolves – Not sure the ‘be crap to start with, sack the manager, and improve no end’ bit is going to work this season. They finish in 20th despite an excellent challenge from above.",

      "It is the responsibility of both teams to try and win a match. If one club goes to another, and sits all its men behind the ball, has no ambition to do anything other than defend and hope to get a counter, I would say the poor quality of the match and the football itself, is not the fault of the team trying to win the match, but the one trying desperately hard not to lose it.",
      "In this tortuous analogy, Arsenal are the team who actually want to win their matches, and their opponents are the ones desperate not to lose.",
      "So you can be upset that Arsenal score goals from set pieces and that might be ruining the ‘quality’ of the league, but at least we want to try and win. Considering our opponents average an xG against us of 0.8 per game, it tells me they aren’t even trying to score, whereas ours is 1.6 in comparison.",
      "Your craven clubs, with the hundreds of millions spent by them, are still too scared and lack the ambition to even want to try and win. So get mad at your own clubs and players for ruining the league. As an Arsenal fan, I love 1-nil results. I was raised on them. Bould at the near post flick on to someone in the middle. It was beautiful that George Graham was at the ground to witness our 1-nil against Palace (who are an excellent team).",

      "Because currently, all I can see on social media is Arsenal fans putting their bragging to one side while they attempt to inform the masses that corner kicks have been a thing since 1872, which by the way is a full 14 years before the club was formed, and also, crucially, 153 years ago.",
      "Suddenly, corners and set pieces are a widespread problem. I wonder why? The Arsenal freaks on Twitter are thankfully doing the Lord’s Work and pulling up tweets from official accounts of United or Liverpool or whoever, who are actually ‘bragging’ about their set piece specialists from once upon a time, while genuinely intelligent people such as Jon MacKenzie are asking if we should implement rule changes!! Wtf are we doing here honestly?",
      "Someone has also found a video of Jamie Carragher praising Chelsea’s ability to turn set pieces into goals about six years ago, while he and Freddie Ljungberg laugh together about how Arsene Wenger neglected the coaching of these scenarios in training, and that was probably a bit of a mistake. Quite funny, in hindsight.",
      "Honestly, you couldn’t make up what you’re seeing right now on the cesspit platform. All of this is the TLDR way of saying: Jamo, we are not bragging about anything. We are not yet in November and we’ve been burnt thrice in a row by one thing or another (our fault or otherwise), so you are clearly either looking in the wrong place or completely making it up.",

      "In an attempt to move on from the hyperbolic headlines, here is my attempt at diagnosing the problems and potential solutions to the poor run of form at Liverpool.",
      "Problems:",
      "Evolution from 433: Clearly this years’ signings marked an evolutionary move from Liverpool’s long serving 433 formation. Slot admitted that the signings were intended to give us more flexibility in the way we lined up against teams. Wirtz a clear number 10 means we were at times moving away from Klopp’s 6 and two 8s and Slot’s two 6s and an 8. It is also a clear move away from a team which gets its running and physicality from 3 midfielders with creativity provided by the full backs and the attackers. MacAllister and Wirtz are a long way from Hendo and Gini. Wirtz is most like Coutinho who didn’t fit within the 433 and had to leave. Buying Wirtz for 9 figures means we are moving away from 433 which will naturally unsettle some players who have played it for years. I see the logic in having someone like Wirtz to unlock the low block which Liverpool often face.",
      "The combined signing of Isak and Wirtz suggest a possible move away from 3 up front or certainly configuring the 3 differently. Is Slot’s ultimate long term vision 2 upfront, Wirtz at the tip of a diamond midfield behind, with Frimpong and Kerkez providing the width and legs?",
      "Leaking goals: Whether it’s the change in the formation, change in players or just poor form. Liverpool have leaked goals particularly of late.",
      "Missing Trent: I hope the long-time critics of TAA can see the error of their ways. Defensively Trent was never as bad as people alleged and Liverpool have not locked down the right hand side of the defence since he left. Issues on the right were never Trent being ‘the worst defender’ in the world. They were chiefly the result of Salah not tracking back and neither Milner or Henderson being replaced to fill in the gap.",
      "There is a Trent shaped hole in this team from an attacking perspective. It lacks creativity from deep and the ability to turn defence into attack with one quick pass",
      "Salah out of form: No one misses Trent more than Salah whose form has dipped noticeably. No one expected last year again but he has been poor. He has not found the right chemistry with teammates on the right. The lack of a consistent ball over the top (Trent!) means he is easier to mark. Putting Wirtz into midfield means there is one less person to do his running leaving us badly exposed to pace on the opposition left (Semenya, Eze, Mbuemo etc…). If I zoom out, I think in the absence of Trent, Salah is more likely to drift infield to an inside right position which I think is really where Wirtz would like to play. Really what we are seeing is the painful transition from a Salah led offense to a Wirtz led offence. It is now a question of how soon this happens.",
      "Big names, small performances: New signings have not settled. Isak in a red shirt is still miles from Isak in a Newcastle shirt. Frimpong is supposed to bring pace on the right to provide an overlap for Wirtz and others creating from midfield. He has had a shaky start and doesn’t seem to be a defensive upgrade from Trent. Wirtz has not looked like the best player in Germany and doesn’t seem to know where he should play. He looks for time he’s not going to get in the PL. Most disappointing for me has been Kerkez who isn’t adapting to a new league and should have been an immediate improvement on the left. He has been physically weak and reckless in tackles.",
      "MacAllister has been poor in every aspect of the game from tackling to passing and has rightly been dropped for Jones. Konate had a shocking start to the season and there is a risk his head has been turned. Salah, see above.",
      "Missing Allison: The new keeper does not look like the best young keeper in the world. He’s been nervous coming and dealing with crosses and dived too soon twice for Brentford goals. It was tough watching Kelleher for Brentford on Saturday. When you miss Allison you miss a keeper who makes saves he shouldn’t and is lethal in one on ones.",
      "Brass tax, Liverpool have conceded 7 in GM’s 3 PL games vs. 7 in Allison’s 6 PL games.",
      "Look at the 3 games and the goals conceded and ask would Allison save it? Mbuemo definitely, Caicaido he could have and the Brentford goals he would certainly have done better.",
      "Solutions:",
      "Sort the defence first. It applies to Sunday league and premier league alike. You cannot win games conceding too many goals. We need to get a defence sorted. For me that means putting Gomez at RB and Robbo at LB. Play a flat back 4. If the game requires it, start Endo at the base of MF until RG is fit again. This also means getting midfielders and wingers to put in a shift to cover the defence.",
      "Continue everyone is droppable: Salah and MacAllister have rightly been dropped for playing badly. This needs to be the case. Chiesa and Jones deserve their chances and if they don’t get them now then they have to leave the club. Past performances and big transfer fees shouldn’t guarantee a player a spot either. Isak and Wirtz similarly need to be droppable.",
      "Play Szoboszlai in MF: He’s our only shining light this season. Just start him in midfield every game, no messing around at RB. Play him at 6 or 8. With RG out we should start him at 6 for now.",
      "Use the injuries to settle the team: Injuries mean there are less options and allows the team to settle a bit. Isak being injured means continuing with 3 upfront and playing Hugo at 9. This should always have been the case but it’s easier to have the big transfer injured than dropped. Jones and RG being out means playing an offensive midfield 3 of Macallister, DS and Wirtz which makes the solid 4 at the back even more important. Hopefully this will see MacAllister and Salah settle and find their form but if that doesn’t happen Chiesa and Endo should be put in.\nPL from DL",

My response is that VVD and McAllister conspired together to be absolute balls and the ball immediately went into a dangerous area leading to a goal. Two things here. It was a Liverpool player who made that howler; if it was Mbeumo who did it then 150% stop play but it seems like something rife for gaming the system if play gets stopped because teammates run into each other and someone goes down holding their head. Ed more than welcome to tell me if I’m talking bollocks",
      "With regards to the stitches, having worked at sea for 10+ years, I’ve had (cumulatively) 7 staples and 12 stitches in my head over three separate occasions, it’s nothing more than an elaborate boo boo that McAllister definitely made the most of and considering there was no actual concussion test or anything that I saw, in hindsight, I think the ref got it right.",
      "Ryan, Bermuda: All salient points made, well done that man – and decent PS from Ed. Which leads me on to one of my bugbears in football. A defender can often come sliding through, absolutely clattering a striker after they have had a shot without any censure because of some weird logic that they’ve already had a shot without any consideration to the fact that an uncontrolled ~100kgs of defender sliding at the striker across the turf at 20km/h, may have in fact, put the striker off.",

It is truly baffling and Ryan certainly is Me when I scratch my head at some of the rules, the opaqueness of their application and disaster refereeing. I know we have more chance of Maggie rising from her grave to vote for the Green Party, but I do think we should all, as Prem fans, start making more noise for the rules, VAR and refereeing to be MUCH MORE professionally applied to the Prem.",

There seems to be an allure of big personalities, hungry for glory, loving the limelight , as if that alone will rub off on the team and make them successful. Managers celebrated for their drive and self-assurance when things go well (well, at least the managers do a great job of selling that vision.)

      "As promised we’re revisiting this ranking of the 20 biggest summer signings having last judged just three games into the season.",
      "“We’re all thoroughly looking forward to the prospect of Alexander Isak being the flop of all flops,” we wrote at the time, as the striker wasn’t included at that stage having not yet made an appearance for Liverpool. But joy of joys, he has now.",
      "Nick Woltemade, Eberechi Eze, Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho also make it this time, but the wait goes on for Yoane Wissa to make up the full 20.",
      "We’ve included their previous position in brackets.",
      "All of his personal gripes with Newcastle and their ‘broken promises’ considered, along with the injustice surrounding the imbalance of power between clubs and players with regard to contracts, we can’t help but feel quite pleased he’s not gone to Liverpool and continued to bang goals in for fun, particularly given the consistently trotted-out reason for his struggles being his lack of fitness, which is entirely his own fault.",
      "READ: Top 10 things that make no f***ing sense as Premier League enters its chaos era",
      "He’s playing like someone who’s always trying to make up for mistakes he hasn’t made yet, but then duly does make because of that desperation to impress. He doesn’t know where to be or what to do so tries to be everywhere and do everything, and is therefore usually nowhere, doing nothing.",
      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team he is to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man. No goals, just one assist and now spending most of his time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench.",
      "",
      "Still feels nailed on to be the next talented forward Chelsea can’t be arsed to develop before flipping for profit, or at least for no great loss within the next two years. He’s started just two Premier League games as Alejandro Garnacho is now Enzo Maresca’s preferred choice on the left, but did impress in the 5-1 win over Ajax in the Champions League.",
      "The German media claimed after another so-so performance from Wirtz in his national team’s victory over Northern Ireland that the poor lad ‘has forgotten his joy’, and that feels like a very accurate assessment of his Liverpool career to date.",
      "It’s impossible to know how big a problem he is in a sea of problems for Arne Slot, but he was never a solution.",
      "Wirtz was signed as a generational talent the Liverpool chiefs rightly or wrongly – it evidently looks more like the latter right now – believed they couldn’t miss out on, rather than a player they needed having walked to the title with a brilliant, fully-functioning midfield last season.",
      "READ: Liverpool screwed Marc Guehi transfer in biggest Premier League regret of the season",
      "The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of the season. He was good against Liverpool, then terrible against Nottingham Forest before being hooked at half-time, and got his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland but did f*** all besides. A predictably frustrating season awaits.",
      "Thomas Frank cruelly compared the Netherlands international to Florian Wirtz when asked about his struggle to adapt to life in the Premier League, and Simons has indeed looked similarly short of whatever that thing is required to succeed in the English top flight, looking overawed by the pace and physicality of the football, which tends to be happening around rather than through him.",
      "It’s a huge frustration for all non-Arsenal fans that although their striker not scoring goals remains a valid stick to beat them with, they now couldn’t give two sh*ts about it, as is the case with them only scoring goals from set-pieces.",
      "If anything, Gyokeres drawing blanks and Declan Rice corners and free-kicks being their only weapon has become something many of them genuinely hope continues indefinitely, such is the balling of fists it engenders in their rivals. If they get to a point where they don’t bristle when the rest of us call out their manager for being an arrogant pr*ck they will be indestructible.",
      "READ: Arteta, Gyokeres among eight reasons why Arsenal won’t win the Premier League title this season",
      "He did himself no favours by stepping up 10th in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far, but fair f***s to him for not crumbling after that inauspicious introduction to life as a Premier League footballer.",
      "",
      "Given we may never have been more invested in an Arsenal player doing well we briefly wondered whether the #NOTOMADUEKE petition was actually signed by a bunch of genius Gunners seeking support from the masses for one of their big summer signings.",
      "We gave our heads a wobble and reverted to our previous opinion of them as a bunch of unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency, which will allow us to continue to enjoy Madueke’s performances after he returns from injury.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves has been followed by not a lot else from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality, but nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "",
      "Feels harsh to bump down this list after a significant uptick in his impact on games against Liverpool and then Brighton, but if we’re to tar all Manchester United forwards with the brush Roy Keane has used to claim Mason Mount is underserving of a place in Ruben Amorim’s team then Cunha really needs to improve on his output after one (wonderful) goal and no assists in nine appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "Ekitike said what all players must when asked about competition for places on the back of Alexander Isak’s deadline-day arrival from Newcastle, insisting he’s looking forward to the challenge rather than frankly a bit f***ed off that he could do nothing to avoid his inevitable ousting from the starting XI in favour of his rival for the No.9 position.",
      "He will still be wondering just how terrible Isak will have to be when he returns from injury to not be included ahead of him, because apparently six goals and an assist in 700 minutes of football wasn’t worthy of that place ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "",
      "He got two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games to provide genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack, and although that hope has faded as he’s not got a sausage since, that’s more down to a realisation that he’s far more accomplished as a second striker.",
      "Whether that’s something Maresca can accommodate when Liam Delap and Cole Palmer return from injury remains to be seen, but Chelsea look a far better team when the Brazilian’s playing in that slightly more withdrawn role than as the furthest man forward.",
      "Martin Odegaard’s injury has seen Eze revert to his typical No.10 position and lo and behold, when playing in the role he’s made his name in, he’s thriving.",
      "His first Arsenal goal, the winner against his former club, was really special and he joins a growing list of Gunners players making it very difficult to hate them as a whole.",
      "",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos and Mbeumo is chief among them. He’s now got five goals and an assist, and looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "We would count Zubimendi in that same list of admirable, good guys in the Arsenal ranks with Eze and as suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet.",
      "As Arteta pointed out recently, while so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we’ve got a veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Big Nick hit the ground running at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",
      "He looks a threat every time he gets on the ball, aiming to beat his man whenever possible rather than recycling the ball as far too many wingers are prone to see as priority one these days. He’s undoubtedly the player Spurs fans are paying to watch in what are otherwise stolid performances producing very good results.",

      "When asked earlier this month whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better.",
      "“He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",

      "However, victories over Sunderland and Liverpool saw them win back-to-back matches for the first time since Amorim joined, while another win over Brighton on Saturday made it three in a row.",
      "Amorim had stubbornly refused to move away from his preferred formation and tactics earlier in the season and it now seems to be paying off.",

      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “I admire it to a certain extent. But, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don’t think he’s changed drastically, he’s just tweaked.",
      "“That’s what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you’ve got. Maybe don’t be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven’t got the ball.",
      "“You can’t press, press, press for 90 minutes, unless you’re an absolute beast of a team. PSG do it. This manager couldn’t do that with this squad.",

We might look back in six months and, say Man United finish in the Champions League or something like that, he’ll probably sit there confidently and go, ‘Well, if I did change, I probably would be out of a job because I have been doing things that are alien to me’.”",
      "Gary Neville insists he was “a little worried” that Amorim had lost the belief of the players a few weeks ago but now believes the Man Utd head coach has survived the “month of reckoning” at Old Trafford.",
      "“But one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people around the club is that they really like him as a person, and that does count for a lot. Because I think there’s no doubt – he’s not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him.",
      "“I think they want to play for him, they’re desperate to win and I think you’ve seen that coming together in the last week. I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special, but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected I think has given them such a big lift.",
      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after – there’s still a big job to do in the next month. But I felt it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week against Liverpool it could have gone a different way but it feels very different, it feels like the momentum is with them a little bit and the spirit is good.”",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Man Utd have a dire track record in the transfer market as they have made plenty of poor decisions, though this changed during this summer’s window.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m as one of this summer’s biggest spenders in Europe on Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, with each of these signings making a great impact in recent matches.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side also managed to offload most of their ‘bomb squad’ members on their terms, with fees secured in permanent deals or buy options for Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony.",
      "However, this has not always been the case, and Ferdinand has slammed Man Utd’s decision to sell Danny Welbeck to Arsenal in 2014 for around £16m.",
      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "The 34-year-old proved to be a solid addition for Arsenal and he has enjoyed a late-career renaissance at Brighton, scoring 15 Premier League goals since the start of last season.",
      "Now, Ferdinand has explained why it was an “absolute balls-up” from Man Utd to offload Welbeck.",
      "“I think he should’ve stayed at Man United, obviously, sometimes it’s not his decision,” Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“I think it was an absolute balls-up that they actually let him leave the football club.",
      "“A Manchester boy, loves the club, a great kid, never a day’s trouble for anybody at the football club, never gets into trouble, his nose is always clean, got a nice way about him, great family… what are you selling him for?",

That’s what should have happened with Danny Welbeck.",
      "“He’s a class act on and off the pitch, a great guy.”",
      "Ferdinand has also explained why he thinks Welbeck needs to be in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup as the “second to Harry Kane”.",
      "“He’s second to Harry Kane,” Ferdinand added.",
      "“If you’re talking form right now and the squad was being picked tomorrow, Danny Welbeck has to go, no?",
      "“Experience, can do different types of things on the pitch for you, he can run in behind if need be, we saw that at Old Trafford, he can come short and link play as well as anybody outside of Harry Kane, He’s an all-round footballer, if it wasn’t for the injuries he had earlier in his career.",
      "“I would take him. If he finishes the season in the form he’s in right now, there’s no way you can’t take him because he’s only going there for a month, it ain’t like we’re saying to him he has to play a full season, you’ve got to be ready and that role he can do that, coming in and out, be a support act for someone like Harry Kane.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think £65m for Luis Diaz was “good business” for Liverpool. We’re confident it was very good business, actually.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Jamie Carragher over his ‘disrespect’ of a Man Utd star who’s proven him wrong under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",

      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "“So if it is to be one in January and then one in the summer, I think Gallagher has a stronger chance of departing Atletico Madrid mid-season.",

      "“If they’re to buy him, the price is in excess of 35 million pounds, and it remains to be seen whether Manchester United choose to spend that money in January, but if it is one January, one summer, keep an eye on Conor Gallagher mid-season.”",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes insists that Liverpool are ‘considering submitting a bid of around €60m (£52m)’ and Atletico Madrid ‘must decide whether to keep him or accept a market-shaking offer’.",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",
      "Man United with Casemiro on the pitch: 3 goals conceded",
      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "There are very real and very important updates on Marc Guehi’s transfer status from a top source, among the rest of the usual Mediawatch nonsense.",
      "We could see Brendan Rodgers at West Ham, but where’s the fun in that? For his sake and ours, it’s time to take the Brendan Show to the international stage.",
      "It is looking increasingly likely that Arsenal will finally win the Premier League this season, but here are eight reasons why they could cock it up…",
      "Frank Lampard’s Coventry City are hammering teams in the Championship but is it a trend that will continue?",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces."

      "Still, Man Utd’s summer transfer window was not perfect as they failed to sign a quality No.6.",

      "So if Man Utd are to truly be back under Amorim, an upgrade on Casemiro needs to be their next marquee signing, and this looks increasingly likely to be the case.",
      "But this does not mean necessarily mean Baleba.",
      "A report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd have ‘serious doubts’ about a ‘record’ deal for Baleba as he is ‘not yet worth breaking the bank for’.",
      "And these concerns are justified as Baleba is far from the final product and there are issues surrounding his mentality; his performances have clearly been impacted by transfer speculation this season.",
      "The report claims Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ’emerging as names of interest’ and these two would be cheaper than Baleba, while also potentially being better fits for the No.6 role at Old Trafford.",
      "And a contract ‘decision’ is another positive sign for Man Utd, with Football Insider claiming they ‘are not planning to trigger the extension option’ in Casemiro’s deal to extend his deal to 2027 on the same terms.",
      "Although Casemiro’s performances this season have been stronger than in 2024/25, he remains a weak link in Man Utd’s side and his reported £375,000-a-week contract cannot be justified at this stage of his career.",
      "Casemiro could stay at Man Utd by accepting a sizable pay cut, but this feels pretty unlikely with Saudi Pro League sides ‘tracking’ the veteran midfielder.

      "“Casemiro’s game is not about chasing high up the pitch constantly,” the former United defender said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“He built a stellar career on the back of being the glue, the person that knitted the back line and the midfield together and just plug the gaps. He wasn’t asked to run all over the place or be a creator. He was asked to get it and give it to the people that can create.",
      "“He might have scored the odd goal here and there when he went a bit loose, but he was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and being able to stay in an area and marshal that area.",
      "“Recently, this is what we’ve seen. He’s looked something like the old Casemiro.”",
      "Casemiro impressed in his first season for United after making his £70m move from Real Madrid, but two poor seasons followed for the Brazilian, who has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit throughout that inauspicious spell.",

      "“Leave the football, before the football leaves you,” he said. “The football has left him at this top level. He has to call it a day at this level of football and move.”",
      "But of the 16 goals United have conceded this season, just three of them have come with Casemiro on the pitch, and Ferdinand has used this evidence of his revival to aim a jab at Carragher.",
      "“It takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about, ‘leave the football’,” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“I said at the time, I thought it was highly disrespectful when you’re talking about a five-time Champions League winner who’s going through a change in approach to football, going through a time where he looked out of sorts.",
      "“Players lose confidence, they lose form, sometimes players’ legs go, but I think the call was too early and I thought it was highly disrespectful for someone who’s achieved so much in the game.",
      "“Sometimes you’ve got to look beyond just trying to find an individual. We’re very fond of finding a scapegoat. Sometimes you got to look at the way a team is playing and work out is that impacting a player negatively or is it actually the player who’s gone?",
      "“I think by looking at the way that the system’s changed a little bit and been tweaked, you’re seeing the benefits for someone like Casemiro.",

      "Vinicius Junior muttered “I’m leaving the team” having failed to hide his frustration at being substituted in El Clasico and reports on Monday suggest he is ‘seriously considering’ an exit owing the lack of ‘respect’ afforded to him by manager Xabi Alonso. But where could he go? There’s just one option.",
      "Vinicius has helped Madrid win 14 trophies since his arrival in 2018, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, playing a starring role in many of those triumphs. But the 2024 Ballon d’Or runner-up’s frustrations – which have been bubbling under the surface for weeks at the Bernabeu – came to the surface as he stormed off the pitch on Sunday.",
      "After starting on the bench for Madrid’s previous league clash with Getafe, Vinicius was recalled to Alonso’s XI as goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham sealed Madrid a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, but was withdrawn in the 72nd minute by Alonso and made it abundantly clear what he thought of his manager’s decision.",
      "“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?” Vinicius was heard shouting at Alonso as his No.7 appeared on the fourth official’s board.",
      "The 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes in just three of Madrid’s 12 games in all competitions this season and before making his way straight down the tunnel, he’s alleged to have muttered: “Always me! I’m Leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!”",
      "And according to AS, ‘the option of leaving’ is now ‘being seriously considered’ by Vinicius, who believes Alonso ‘doesn’t like him’ and that his ‘status isn’t respected’ by the Spaniard, with the growing rift between the pair a ‘massive problem’ for the club.",
      "Alonso looked to pacify the situation after the game, saying: “I’m taking away many positive things from Vini’s game and I don’t want to lose focus on what’s important.",
      "“He contributed a lot. It’s an important victory, a deserved one. Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.",
      "“Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.”",
      "The report adds that the Madrid hierarchy are prepared to back any decision Alonso makes with regard to Vinicius’ future having been far from impressed by the winger’s reaction to being subbed.",
      "And with it suggested last month that Vinicius may seek a January exit having been benched for Madrid’s Champions League opener, we can only assume his resolve to seek pastures new has gathered strength after this latest perceived snub.",
      "But the question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be the man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case. And there’s nowhere to go for him but Saudi Arabia.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain used to be a landing spot for the star misfits of other European giants, but they’ve become a serious football team of late.",
      "Liverpool made several Galactico signings in the summer, but to their cost so far this season, and we can’t see Arne Slot welcoming such a character into his dressing room.",
      "MORE REAL MADRID COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Raphinha hits out at Barcelona team-mate Yamal for giving Real Madrid ‘extra motivation’ in El Clasico\n👉 Jude Bellingham aims savage three-word dig at Lamine Yamal after El Clasico bust-up\n👉 The ridiculous records of Kylian Mbappe, including his 23 career hat-tricks",
      "If anyone could get a handle on Vinicius, it might just be Pep Guardiola, but Manchester City haven’t typically chased players of such repute, other than Erling Haaland, who joined for the relatively meagre prices they’re used to paying for their recruits.",
      "Arsenal may still be after a left-wing upgrade, but much as we would enjoy his clash with Arteta, theirs is a boat that doesn’t need rocking.",
      "Manchester United aren’t in a position to attract a player of Vinicius’ quality even if they wanted to, and we can’t imagine they do at a point where Ruben Amorim looks finally to have his squad pulling together as one.",
      "There’s very little chance of Chelsea paying that much for a player who is on the brink of being too old for them anyway at 25, and even less chance of Vinicius joining a club where the chances of the most major trophies look slim in the short-term.",
      "And given there is no European club other than PSG outside the Premier League with the wherewithal to pay Real Madrid and Vinicius what’s required to sign him, even assuming they had the desire, if we were his advisors, and weren’t the money-grabbing so-and-sos we suspect they are, we would urge him to mend bridges which are currently singed at a club from which he has no better, or even remotely comparable, place to go, before he burns them beyond repair.",
      "Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior has issued a statement amid claims he could leave the Bernabeu with Man Utd and Chelsea linked.",
      "According to reports, Vinicius Junior ‘could leave’ Real Madrid after clashing with head coach Xabi Alonso as their “relationship is broken’.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly willing to sacrifice any player, except Kylian Mbappe, to land Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz. So, Vinicius Jr to Man Utd then?",
      "Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior reportedly ‘will be sold’ in the summer if he rejects a contract offer, with a £300million bid coming, per an insider.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City have finally ‘convinced’ a Real Madrid star to leave and join Pep Guardiola’s side in a ‘radical’ U-turn.",
      "Real Madrid are ready to let Vinicius Junior leave the club on a free transfer amid interest from Arsenal and Liverpool, according to reports."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached a ‘decision’ on whether to offload Kobbie Mainoo, while another star is ‘heading out in January’.",
      "Mainoo is in a difficult situation at Man Utd as he has fallen down the pecking order under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The England international enjoyed a remarkable breakout season for Man Utd and England in 2023/24, though injuries, a decline in form and the appointment of Amorim have impacted him.",
      "Amorim is clearly not a huge admirer of Mainoo, who has only been a bit-part player over the past year as the United boss has favoured Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield.",
      "This has fuelled reports linking Mainoo with an exit from Man Utd, with the 20-year-old submitting a request to leave on loan in the summer.",
      "READ: Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first",
      "At the time, Serie A giants Napoli were leading the race to secure his services, but Man Utd refused to let him leave as they felt that his exit would leave them short of options.",
      "Mainoo has remained linked with an exit of late, but a new report from Football Insider claims Man Utd’s ‘decision’ on his future ahead of the winter transfer window is that they are ‘still refusing to let him leave on loan’.",
      "There is said to be one reason for this verdict.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources say that Ruben Amorim is set on keeping him and sees him as a key part of his plans for the rest of the season.",
      "‘Sources say that Mainoo is next in line to come into the Amorim’s midfield, behind Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.’",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is far more likely to leave Man Utd in January, though.",
      "The forward has barely featured for Man Utd this season as he’s behind Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the pecking order.",
      "Zirkzee was linked with an exit in the summer, but he looks set to follow Rasmus Hojlund in the coming months.",
      "Caught Offside says Zirkzee is ‘heading out in January’ as he ‘knows regular football is essential’ in a World Cup year.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The striker wants a solution in the January transfer window with a move away from Old Trafford highly likely, sources close to the agents industry have informed CaughtOffside.",
      "‘The club, meanwhile, are looking to cash in, with an asking price in the €35-40 million range. United hold advantage at the moment with the player contracted to the club till June 2029.’",
      "Serie A side Napoli will attempt to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo again in the January transfer window to solve a ‘crisis’, according to reports.",

      "It was shortly after an impassioned rant from Roy Keane about the state of Manchester United – a shocking turn of events in itself – that Ruben Amorim felt compelled to stand up for one particular “f***ing imposter” in his squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had just scored a clever free-kick against Arsenal which undoubtedly helped his case, but Amorim wanted to underline the Portuguese’s importance further.",
      "“We need more Brunos, that is clear,” he said. “It’s not just the quality and the character. He makes some mistakes but he is so decisive with and without the ball.",
      "“He steps up all the time. He can show some frustration in some moments that can hurt him more than everyone. I understand that. He wants to win.",
      "“But he is always available, can play in different positions and when we need a goal and an assist he is always there.”",
      "The exorcism of a fair few Brighton ghosts suggested “more Brunos” were indeed delivered at great expense in the summer.",
      "Fernandes was integral to the win; no player had more touches, created more chances, had more shots nor made more tackles. And his dummy for the clinching Bryan Mbeumo goal was a piece of extraordinary awareness and skill.",
      "But for the first time since he joined, Manchester United scored four times in a Premier League game without Fernandes being credited with either a goal or an assist.",
      "That does require some erasure of that stoppage-time feint to leave Ayden Heaven’s pass to run through to Mbeumo but it still shows that Manchester United are becoming less cripplingly dependent on their best player.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up. Matheus Cunha, too, with his wonderful opener. And Benjamin Sesko, whose glorious touch, turn and pass set Mbeumo free for his first.",
      "With Casemiro and Luke Shaw chipping in too it was strange to watch a Manchester United side thrive and combine in attack without desperately trying to shift the ball to Fernandes as quickly as possible.",
      "It took until his 300th appearance for the club for others to shoulder more of that responsibility but it’s better late than never. And for his entire Old Trafford career before last weekend it really did feel as though ‘never’ was the far likelier option.",
      "Keane was right when he said “talent is not enough” back in March, and that attitude and application are at least as important in the equation for making the most optimal teams and individuals. But Fernandes always felt like a strange subject to centre that argument around considering the effort he has expended each week for almost six years.",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos, more characters, more leaders for far too long. Amorim might finally have got his wish.",
      "There are very real and very important updates on Marc Guehi’s transfer status from a top source, among the rest of the usual Mediawatch nonsense.",
      "We could see Brendan Rodgers at West Ham, but where’s the fun in that? For his sake and ours, it’s time to take the Brendan Show to the international stage.",
      "It is looking increasingly likely that Arsenal will finally win the Premier League this season, but here are eight reasons why they could cock it up…",
      "Frank Lampard’s Coventry City are hammering teams in the Championship but is it a trend that will continue?",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces."

      "Arsenal, Sunderland, Bruno Fernandes and Ezri Konsa are sitting pretty, but West Ham and Wolves are in abysmal states and Liverpool need more help.",
      "Here are your Premier League winners and losers starting with the…",
      "The time has come to stop viewing Sunderland through the prism of a newly promoted team. It underlines their immediately acclimatised brilliance to compare their results and performances to those who have come up from the Championship in recent years, but also does them a massive disservice and puts a natural ceiling on what they can achieve.",
      "This is, for all intents and purposes, a ready-made and proven Premier League side. They have remarkable depth – only four clubs have used more players so far – and can win games in a variety of ways.",
      "If they don’t catch you from a corner or a counter, Granit Xhaka will find an alternative route through or Wilson Isidor will exploit the space in behind.",
      "Regis Le Bris is fully subscribed to the power of long throws and set-pieces, but Sunderland have also scored more goals in open play than Arsenal and Newcastle, with just Arsenal, Brighton, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs boasting more different scorers. They have won matches with 54% and 32% possession.",
      "No club has gained more points from losing positions than a Sunderland side which has dropped none when winning. Sure, they have already passed the tallies of the last two teams to come up and finish bottom, but the Black Cats also have more points than Leicester did at this stage in 2015/16.",
      "They probably won’t win their seventh English top-flight title this season, but that qualifier being necessary for Sunderland about four years after they were in the midst of a losing run against Charlton, Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday in League One, when Le Bris was managing a French club’s B team and waiting for his first post at a senior level, is astonishing.",
      "",
      "It would have been a phenomenal weekend had they not even played, with Liverpool and Manchester City both falling to obstacles of a similar size and difficulty to facing Crystal Palace at home.",
      "Mikel Arteta told his players he “valued more this victory than any other victory this season because we knew the difficulty of it”. Palace are an obdurate opponent but at the end of an eight-day stretch in which they also faced Fulham away and Atletico Madrid at home, it was a substantial test of their mental strength and credentials.",
      "Arsenal did not concede a single goal in those games. Their majesty is built not on set-piece mastery but unmatched defensive excellence. They have kept five consecutive clean sheets and faced at least 13 fewer shots than any other team.",
      "Had Arsenal automatically conceded every shot on target they had allowed this season they would still be in the top half of the table with 13 points, while occupying a seeded Champions League knockout phase place. David Raya is more libero than goalkeeper at this point.",
      "Only four clubs in the entire history of the Premier League have conceded fewer than three goals after nine games – and that Chelsea 2005/06 side is not actually among them. A ludicrous record is in genuine jeopardy.",
      "",
      "Perhaps Arsenal won’t replace Mikel Arteta with Nicolas Jover, and Aston Villa might not promote Austin MacPhee to Unai Emery’s seat in the dugout. But the appointment of Keith Andrews as Brentford manager ahead of the season of the long throws seems like remarkable prescience.",
      "That is not to denigrate an entirely deserved win over the champions. As with Arsenal, the Brentford set-piece approach only works when underpinned by energy, bravery and clarity. It is designed to complement their quality rather than define it.",
      "Brentford are intelligent with their pressing, incisive when counter-attacking and committed in defence. Those are the foundations, not Michael Kayode launching it into the box.",
      "As Andy Robertson said, “you can’t come to Brentford away and just expect to play them off the park because they’re always going to be ready to fight”. But they can absolutely play too. You might say they are as adept at floating like a butterfly as they are stinging like the Bees if you were so inclined.",
      "",
      "For the first time since he joined, Manchester United scored four times in a Premier League game without Fernandes getting a goal or an assist.",
      "Ruben Amorim was right and he will be thrilled.",
      "",
      "It does feel like they’re doing Chelsea’s bit, just comfortably better.",
      "Bournemouth have the American owner, the multi-club system from which they are able to pluck the best talents, the focus on youth and the embrace of a player trading model which sees millions spent and recouped each year when it functions properly.",
      "But Bournemouth also have an exceptional coach to bring everything together, and a unity which seems to run all the way through the chain of command.",
      "Their only Premier League defeat this season was basically a case of poor timing; had they faced Liverpool at any other time beyond that opening weekend, Bournemouth might well have won.",
      "And the way in which Andoni Iraola has drilled these players to the extent that they are essentially interchangeable is ridiculous. Veljko Milosavljevic can already be trusted to deputise at 18 and Eli Junior Kroupi has stepped up incredibly well in place of Evanilson at 19.",
      "",
      "A stunning win for Burnley and Scott Parker, but what an absolutely breath-taking last-minute save to secure it. James Trafford could never.",
      "",
      "That late shift of his body to block a Phil Foden through ball into Erling Haaland was sublime. It felt like a replay of the sort of goal Manchester City have scored habitually over the years, doctored to show how it could theoretically be prevented.",
      "It is impossible to do justice to the levels of concentration and fitness required to pull that off in the 86th minute of a match Konsa dominated before and after too. He and Amadou Onana were fantastic.",
      "READ NEXT: Liverpool could lose £35m windfall after ‘selfish’ player dropped before stunning win",
      "",
      "Ao Tanaka admitted he was “not good enough at the moment” having only recently recovered from an injury, although he did also say every Premier League game is “difficult” as “the opponents are so good” after facing Nuno’s West Ham so he might not be the most reliable narrator.",
      "Perhaps only Ange Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest and Vitor Pereira’s Wolves have been easier assignment in this season’s top flight, and Leeds were lucky enough to face and beat the latter too.",
      "Only five clubs have picked up more points against sides currently in the bottom half; winning these six-pointers is a handy knack for Daniel Farke’s side to develop.",
      "And the remarkably potent combination of Tanaka and Elland Road could be key. The Japan international made his 20th home start for Leeds and the Whites have won 18 of those games, with draws against West Brom and Swansea in March the only exceptions.",
      "Tanaka might not be able to match the physicality of his teammates, but his more technical side can give Leeds a dimension they sometimes lack.",
      "",
      "For the first time since April 13, a run stretching back 17 matches, Newcastle have won a Premier League game in which they also conceded. Each of their last five victories had been to nil but this was overdue proof they can just about strike a balance between defence and attack.",
      "With clean sheets on the agenda, the Rafa Benitez ‘short blanket’ analogy again comes to mind. He frequently spoke of the inherent difficulty in finding an equilibrium between keeping the ball out of one net and scoring in the other. “If you cover your head, you have your feet cold, but if you cover your feet, you have your head cold,” he would say at a time when managing a club owned by Mike Ashley meant he was fortunate to have the choice between the two.",
      "This version of Newcastle is far closer to that than the We’ll Score One More Than You energy of Kevin Keegan, with seemingly only Liverpool able to evoke the free-scoring spirit of The Entertainers. But Eddie Howe will delight in seeing his side finally learn how to convert a score draw into a win.",
      "",
      "There is no bigger swing between a Premier League team’s PPG home and away this season. Spurs will need to bring their form in north London more in line with that everywhere else at some point but it is handy to develop a knack for winning every other week.",
      "And Guglielmo Vicario has already matched his Premier League clean sheet tally from last season. What a club.",
      "",
      "The face swaps are imminent. West Ham and Nuno might have felt like a perfect marriage born out of opportunism but in less than a month both have been given cause to regret their decisions.",
      "Nuno has accepted the keys to a broken home. West Ham are a complete mess, a picture of complacency and hubris being steered aimlessly by individuals who seemed to believe they were somehow above or insulated from this sort of crisis.",
      "If this ship cannot be turned around or prevented from inevitably capsizing, it will be difficult to think of a more disastrous line of managerial succession than Moyes-Lopetegui-Potter-Nuno. The middle two have since taken up international coaching roles, so harrowing was their last club experience.",
      "And of course West Ham now apparently plan to solve their myriad problems with a busy and ambitious January transfer window, as if their head of recruitment wasn’t sacked earlier this month and they didn’t spend well over £100m in the summer on players the majority of whom apparently cannot be trusted to start.",
      "Nuno dropped Mateus Fernandes – who came on to score – while once again almost completely ignoring Soungoutou Magassa until it was entirely too late.",
      "After making three half-time substitutions in the last game, Nuno changed his formation in the 25th minute having already conceded twice at Elland Road. He seemed to crack the code in his first match but the manager has taken some bizarre steps backwards since.",
      "Nuno insisted his recent changes in team selection and systems did not constitute “experiments” but there are few other explanations for picking inverted full-backs on the wrong side, naming a midfield of Tomas Soucek and Andy Irving or continuing to deploy Lucas Paqueta as a false nine.",
      "Games against Brentford and Leeds had to be circled as opportunities for West Ham to build momentum in a quick five-day burst but instead it has destroyed whatever hope and expectation the club seemed to have, and rendered Nuno a shambles of confused ideas and poor career choices.",
      "",
      "It feels terminal and irreversible at this stage, with the slow death of Wolves as a Premier League club to be stretched out over seven more agonising months.",
      "The manager and captain for the day likely went over to irate fans at full time to try and ease tensions but it seemed to only exacerbate the split between the club and its supporters.",
      "How can Vitor Pereira understand “frustrations” which overlap multiple seasons when he has not been here for a full year yet? Can Jorgen Strand Larsen really empathise with the plight of a club he tried to leave in the summer?",
      "Wolves have mustered two points in nine games and already lost to all three promoted clubs. But this is not the result of a single bad summer; it is the culmination of a controlled and sustained downgrade of the squad through annual asset-stripping.",
      "Only for so long could they get away with habitually selling their best players and replacing them with rank unknowns at a fraction of the price. Wolves have been sleepwalking into this relegation for a couple of years but must now live through the rest of this nightmare.",

      "The visit of Wolves to Craven Cottage on Saturday is magnitudinal and potentially season-defining.",
      "Silva could do with rediscovering his touch when it comes to making goalscoring substitutions, but at least one selection from the start against Newcastle was sub-optimal in hindsight.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe will be consigned to the bench again after being taken off at half-time of his first Premier League start this season. Calvin Bassey perhaps ought to be after marking his return to the XI in place of Jorge Cuenca by conceding possession for both goals. Not ideal.",

      "",
      "Just a thoroughly unreliable institution, incapable of properly building on a galvanising victory over the champions or a consummate thrashing of European royalty.",
      "It must be maddening for Chelsea but then this sort of result is always possible with such an inexperienced group of players being guided by a coach still relatively unseasoned at this level.",
      "That second Sunderland goal should not happen, and doesn’t with any sort of leadership or responsibility being taken in defence. An opposition centre-forward cannot set up camp in the penalty area for five seconds from a long ball and wait for reinforcements while holding one defender at literal arm’s length as another watches.",
      "Between that, the concession of a goal from a long throw and the glee with which Isidor explained how he carried out the full Steed Malbranque on Claude Makelele treatment against Moises Caicedo to shut the hosts down at Stamford Bridge, there was yet more evidence that this is still a Chelsea side far closer to the start of a project than the end.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has been warning of an overreliance on Erling Haaland. When the opposition isolates and nullifies him so masterfully there should be a raft of players desperate to step up and take responsibility.",

      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side are stranded at the bottom of one particularly damning table and it is difficult not to see their stuttering start as a quite considerable step back from previous seasons.",
      "The Carlos Baleba situation in particular might have reached the point of necessary intervention. With Manchester United focusing on Premier League-proven talent again in the transfer market this was a glorious opportunity for the £100m target to follow in the footsteps of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha by impressing against his prospective future employers.",
      "What instead transpired was a deleted social media post and yet another early substitution after being booked. Any audition that results in being shown up by Casemiro and taken off for James Milner in 2025 has not gone well.",
      "",
      "An incredible coach but presumably a terrible poker player. Glasner has one massive tell: if he is breathing he will dig out the Crystal Palace hierarchy for leaving it too late to make signings.",
      "In fairness, it must be especially frustrating considering he specifically warned against it in public and Palace are locked in a midweek-to-weekend European grind which makes adaptation difficult for players.",
      "Palace have perhaps not coincidentally lost both of the Premier League games they have played immediately after Conference League matches.",
      "But Glasner does also need to shoulder some responsibility here. Seven players have started every Palace game – no club has more – and played basically every minute. And most of those have barely been given a Conference League rest either. The manager either has to rotate more or accept some understandably tired performances.",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Tuesday 28 October 2025 14:51, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

It's an art.",

And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (7), Shaw (6), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Heaven (7), Dorgu (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a). \n\n\nBrighton: Verbruggen (6), De Cuyper (6), Dunk (5), Van Hecke (5), Wieffer (6), Ayari (6), Baleba (5), Minteh (6), Rutter (6), Kadioglu (6), Welbeck (7).\n\n\nSubs: Watson (6), Milner (6), Gomez (6), Kostoulas (6), Tzimas (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "Following a third consecutive victory, Gary Neville believes Manchester United have the pieces in place for a top-six finish. Ruben Amorim has come through his month of reckoning but there are still question marks over Benjamin Sesko after Brighton win...",
      "Saturday 25 October 2025 22:19, UK",
      "Gary Neville has declared this to be Ruben Amorim's best week in the job after Manchester United made it three wins in a row in the Premier League with a 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday and believes the template is there for a top-six finish.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
      "\"That's the big job over the next couple of weeks.\"",
