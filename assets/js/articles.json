      "Mbeumo is in high demand this summer after his best ever season for Brentford. He was the club's star man as he scored 20 goals in the Premier League and now could be set for a big move.",
      "United have emerged as the favourites for his signature but after his manager Thomas Frank joined Tottenham, he is said to be 'intrigued' by a switch to north London.",
      "It's understood Mbeumo is still \"leaning towards\" a move to Old Trafford as Amorim bids to overhaul his struggling squad that finished 15th last season, with Matheus Cunha already joining the club.",
      "Mbeumo and Onana have been international team-mates since the former began playing for the side in 2022. Mbeumo has gone on to pick up 22 caps, while Onana has 48.",
      "Brentford could be tempted to cash in on Mbeumo while they can given he is out of contract next season - though there is an option to extend his deal until 2027.",
      "The player himself spoke for the first time since rumours began over his future but did not wade into the speculation, instead opting to discuss Frank and their time together at Brentford.",
      "\"So I can only wish him all the best, and I'm sure he's going to do well. I can only wish him all the best and I'm sure he's going to do well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told he must replace Andre Onana if Manchester United are to become a Premier League force once more. Onana has made regular high-profile mistakes after arriving at Old Trafford in an expensive move from Ajax two years ago.",
      "And now, former United coach Rene Meulensteen believes shipping out Onana will be key to a United revival under Amorim, declaring: “It’s vital they look to replace Onana. If you look at Man United's history, they started building a successful team at Old Trafford through the goalkeeper, with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar, and David De Gea.",
      "\"They must bring confidence to the defence as that galvanises the whole back line. I understood why [Erik] ten Hag brought him in, because he worked with him at Ajax. But it’s a different league.",
      "\"He didn’t get exposed to too many dangers with what he experienced in Holland or Italy, as he does in the Premier League. There are some major frailties and plenty of mistakes.",
      "\"If there is a better goalkeeper available, they should take him. It is not only the quality, they need a strong personality. Having a really good goalkeeper lays the foundations and is massively important.”",
      "Meulensteen was a first-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson for the final five years of the Scot’s Old Trafford reign, playing a part in three Premier League title wins. But Meulensteen, speaking exclusively to Tipman Tips, clearly believes United will not be winning any Premier League crowns soon, especially with the defensive options Amorim currently has at his disposal.",
      "And the 61-year-old Dutchman says Harry Maguire is a symptom of United's deep-seated problems. He explained: “Harry Maguire is an interesting one. He’s received praise but it’s more to do with others being bad.",
      "\"To be fairly honest, Harry is not up to the standard of the quality and the calibre that United needs and plenty of examples have shown that. I’m not saying he's a bad player but he lacks certain aspects of his game defensively that don't meet the standards of Man United.”",
      "While Meulensteen acknowledges that it would be hard to make wholesale changes, he says major upheaval would be ideal, explaining: \"They need a clear-out in defence because they’re very vulnerable in that position. There are six to seven centre backs, and most of them are not good enough.",
      "\"There are question marks around all of them. But because the players are on contracts, you can't just offload them ... it will be a complete financial disaster.",
      "“The issue is, you cannot just suddenly say to 16 players … ‘see you later, off you go’. Who are you going to replace them with? You can get stuck, and that is my biggest worry.”",
      "But Meulensteen would like to see Marcus Rashford have an unlikely second chance under Amorim, saying: “I question the fact as to why things broke down so quickly between them. You talk about a boy who bleeds Man United. If there is interest from clubs in Marcus, will he want to leave regardless of whether United want him? It's going to be interesting from his side.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is a good and valuable player when in a good head space. He's probably one of the best left wingers in the world - and they can’t get someone better.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has admitted that he's not sure he would have been able to turn down the mega-money transfer that Bruno Fernandes was recently offered. Fernandes showed the utmost loyalty to Manchester United earlier this month by turning down a reported £100million move to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, including an estimated £700,000 per-week salary.",
      "Given that the Red Devils have just endured their worst season in Premier League history, finishing 15th and trophyless, many team-mates and fans may not have blamed the club captain for opting to jump ship - especially given that he is approaching the twilight years of his career at 30.",
      "However, Fernandes' leadership qualities were on full display by snubbing the move to Saudi Arabia in favour of remaining at the heart of Ruben Amorim's squad rebuild for 2025/26. And club legend Ferdinand explained that he believes that the decision tells United fans everything they need to know about the attacking midfielder.",
      "\"And listen, I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.'",
      "\"But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%.",
      "\"But the fact that he stayed and said, listen, there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why the managers comfortably give him the armband.\"",
      "However, in the same breath, Ferdinand admitted that he's unsure if he would have been able to turn down the move if he found himself in Fernandes' shoes. He added: \"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no. I've got to be honest.\"",
      "With eight goals and 11 assists to his name this season, Fernandes has often been a shining star in an otherwise dysfunctional United team, and Amorim has already begun improving on positions in which he believes need to be strengthened for 2025/26.",
      "United have already struck a £62.5m deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, and are currently linked with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo as they look to bolster their presence in front of goal. Amorim appears to have the full backing of the board, which, combined with his first pre-season tour, should go a long way to fine-tuning his set-up.",
      "Ferdinand, meanwhile, recently launched his Career Transfer Hub in collaboration with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and their parents in terms of future planning. Speaking on the cause, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "He was outstanding for Brentford last season but a £70million valuation of Bryan Mbeumo seems a touch excessive. But it seems that is what Spurs are prepared to pay in order to secure his services.",
      "As no-one knows Mbeumo better than Thomas Frank, perhaps the 25-year-old is worth that sort of money but, on the overall evidence of his six years in England, it seems a touch excessive. And it would seem unlikely that Manchester United would match or better that figure.",
      "But they might not need to. Mbeumo might tell Brentford that he wants to go to Old Trafford, not Spurs. As unlikely as it seems, Mbeumo could well be a test case for United’s pulling power, which was once unrivalled and has not faded as much as some people might think.",
      "On the face of it, there are many reasons why a move to Spurs is a very attractive proposition for Mbeumo. In no particular order …",
      "*He will be playing in the Champions League.",
      "*He will be playing for a manager he clearly likes and has a relatively long and happy relationship with.",
      "*He will not have to leave London.",
      "And on the face of it, there are many reasons why a move to United is not an unequivocally attractive proposition. In no particular order …",
      "*He will be playing for a manager who might not be there that long.",
      "*He will be playing for a team that finished five places and 14 points below Brentford last season.",
      "*He will not be playing in any European competition, never mind the Champions League.",
      "But there is one fundamental reason why Mbeumo might try and insist on going north. It is still Manchester United. And whenever United re-establish themselves as an elite force in the Premier League - which they will, sooner or later - it will be the biggest story in town.",
      "That is a fact, like it or not. (And I get it that a lot of people don’t.) One of Jurgen Klopp’s mantras was about wanting players who would ‘push the train, not jump on the running train.’",
      "It was a reference to players who relished the challenge of being key to the revitalisation of a team. From his decision to join United and from his comments when signing, Matheus Cunha seems that sort of character.",
      "“I know it’s been a hard season for everyone,” said Cunha. “But I think my decision shows what this club is for me and what I believe this club can be. For me, no-one else is like United.”",
      "And again, a lot of people will not like it, but you can see where Cunha is coming from. Listen, money will play a part. It always does.",
      "United will probably be in a position to pay Mbeumo considerably more than he might earn at Tottenham Hotspur. And a cynic might think the prospect of more money and, with no European football, a lighter workload might be of considerable appeal to the modern footballer.",
      "But for all the club’s tribulations, for all the club’s mediocrity on the field, Manchester United is still a huge draw for a player. And in the case of their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, Spurs might just be about to be reminded of that.",

      "In 2022, as part of the eye-opening BBC documentary 'The Real Mo Farah', the athlete revealed his name was not 'Mo Farah' and that he had been living under somebody else's identity.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has said that Manchester United should look to finish in the top six to eight of the Premier League next season. The Red Devils will be eager to quickly forget 2024/25, given they finished a dismal 15th in the league and failed to achieve silverware both domestically and in Europe.",
      "And while many managers may have had their future thrown into question given the lacklustre campaign, Ruben Amorim - who was only appointed in November following the sacking of Erik ten Hag - has seemingly been given the benefit of the doubt by the board.",
      "The Portuguese tactician was forced to work with a mismatched squad that he inherited when he entered Old Trafford. And, following Ten Hag's spending spree on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Light inlast summer, limited funds were available in January for Amorim to start his own rebuilding project.",
      "There were also fears of failing PSR regulations if they continued to spend frivolously. As a result, Amorim was only able to bring in Patrick Dorgu from Lecce for £25.1million, as well as Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven in a deal thought to be around the £1m mark.",
      "However, it appears as though Amorim will be backed by the board this summer to recruit suitable players for his system, with United already splurging £62.5m on Matheus Cunha from Wolves in the early transfer window.",
      "\"I don't think you should be looking outside of that. And that's from someone who only thought about winning the league at United. So it's a big come-down in that sense.\"",
      "Ferdinand also agreed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Project 150 plans were a little far-fetched at present. The INEOS chair and Red Devils minority shareholder had initially planned to see his club win the league by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary, but the stark reality is that Amorim may need more time than that to work his magic and slowly but surely build United back to the Premier League giants they were under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "While an insider told the Mirror back in March that Amorim \"felt he could get more from the current squad when he came in,\" they added: \"There’s no getting away from the fact that overall it’s been a really tough watch - and that it’s going to take a lot of time and patience to get the team to where they should be. You’ve got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "This, coupled with continually growing rivals in terms of talent, may force Ratcliffe to abandon his ambitious Project 150 plans altogether as United plan for a less turbulent future. It comes as Ferdinand recently launched his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and parents for planning their own futures.",
      "Speaking about the initiative, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents. I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "He was integral in Argentina's World Cup win back in 2022 and is viewed as one of Europe's elite goalkeepers. Now teams in the Saudi Pro League are interested in a move but a switch to Manchester could also be on the cards for the 32-year-old.",
      "According to ESPN Argentina United have now begun discussions with Martinez, who is open to joining Ruben Amorim's side. It is understood that a switch to Old Trafford is his favoured destination even if a move is not imminent.",

      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened for business, meaning Manchester United have between now and 7pm on September 1 to get all of their shopping done.",
      "After opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period for the Club World Cup, the window temporarily closed last Tuesday evening, marking a six-day pause in transfer activity. However, it will now remain open without any further interruptions.",
      "Despite a temporary pause, that did not stop United from officially announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million last Thursday. United had announced they had reached an agreement with their Premier League counterparts to sign him on June 1.",
      "Cunha had been a long-term target for United, meaning they are delighted to have secured his signature nice and early. He should be the first of a handful of new recruits at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In securing Cunha's signature so early, United made their mark on the window quickly, highlighting just how keen they are to show some ambition.",
      "As well as getting a deal in place to sign Cunha prior to the temporary closure, they also made their first move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55m turned down just under a fortnight ago but talks between the two clubs remain ongoing.",
      "Mbeumo has informed Brentford's hierarchy that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer. However, United are yet to table a second bid for the Cameroon international.",
      "However, since the window temporarily closed last Tuesday, Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with interest in Mbeumo. That was almost inevitable after Spurs recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach.",
      "Despite having an excellent relationship with Frank, Mbeumo is understood to be determined to move to Old Trafford. United want to strengthen their attacking options this summer and adding the versatile attacker to the addition of Cunha would be a real statement of intent.",
      "It is believed Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to what United paid for Cunha, although the Brazilian was signed via a release clause. United would like to sign Mbeumo ahead of pre-season starting in July.",
      "Elsewhere, United remain determined to sign a striker this summer. After missing out on Liam Delap earlier this month, they have been linked with a crop of alternative options, including the likes of Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and most recently Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Whoever United plan to try and make their first-choice No.9 will be dependent on outgoings. The prospect of signing Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m will take their spending past the £120m mark before sanctioning any sales.",
      "United are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. Head coach Ruben Amorim wants a new shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also possible.",
      "Much of what United will be able to do on the incoming front will rest on outgoings. Preparing to oversee up to ten departures, United have a collection of players they would like to offload this summer.",
      "The Reds have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales. Each of them spent time out on loan in 2024/25 and United want to offload them permanently ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available at £32.5m and Sancho could command a fee of somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty clause to break their obligation to sign him permanently.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Old Trafford for the right price. Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for him back in January, meaning United are expected to ask for a fee north of £50m.",
      "The former is attracting interest from Inter Milan and it remains to be seen if they will submit a formal offer for the Denmark international. He scored just ten goals for United in 2024/25."

      "“Those players don’t play very much. Casemiro did play in the second half of the season, but generally he’s going to play less given his age. If they can remove all of those players, the total cost of those players for next season could be £80million, maybe £90million.",
      "“That’s a huge part of their wage bill just on those four players. So, if they can get those players out the door, then the financial side of things will continue to improve.\"",

      "The report claims that initial talks were held to consider the possibility of a move.",
      "Manchester United face their most pivotal transfer window in recent memory after a disastrous campaign.",
      "Losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th spot in the Premier League means that there will be no European football at Old Trafford for the first time in over a decade. It means United's task of rebuilding under Ruben Amorim has become that little bit harder, for multiple reasons.",
      "And with the transfer window reopening in a couple of days, I've taken a look here at what a best-case summer would look like for Amorim and the Reds.",
      "Former Chelsea star Florent Malouda has had his say on Jadon Sancho's struggles since moving to the Premier League.",
      "\"If you look at Jadon Sancho’s history in the Premier League, he has never really been able to express his talent as much as he did in Germany,\" he said via Bet365.",
      "\"In Germany, the best club for him was Dortmund, they gave him the platform to express his talent. I think the challenge for him is to be able to accommodate himself with talented players around him and see how he can develop his game, creating connections with other players.",
      "\"If he manages to do that, I think he can succeed with Manchester United. There are not so many clubs bigger than United. I'm not talking about where they stand in the league, but in terms of expectations and platform, it's one of the best clubs in the world.",
      "\"What we need to see is some type of leadership – that is a personal mindset that he needs to develop. I can’t see Sancho on another loan, I think he needs to show resilience. I think he needs to overcome his situation because he has the potential.",
      "\"Leaving is a way to escape your responsibilities. We expect more from him and he should be the one to demand more from himself.\"",
      "Manchester United have reportedly initiated talks with Victor Osimhen regarding a potential move to Old Trafford, only to learn subsequently that Viktor Gyokeres has declined the chance to link-up with Ruben Amorim at the club.",
      "United are on the hunt for attacking options and have been evaluating several strikers due to their impressive form in recent seasons. Osimhen and Gyokeres were, according to reports, being closely watched by scouts.",
      "Footmercato reported that the Premier League team have begun negotiations with Osimhen, with an expectation to still chase Gyokeres' signature from Sporting CP. However, reports from Portugal now indicate that the Sweden international spurned the offer to join United, and his representatives have relayed this decision to club higher-ups.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's career at Manchester United has been anything but uneventful.",
      "For all the winger's obvious talent, disciplinary issues have threatened to derail his time at the club on a number of occasions. That threat has now become a reality.",
      "Perhaps the biggest shame in all of this is that Ruben Amorim and Garnacho tried to make it work. After Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad in December, the latter didn't make another appearance for United and was soon shipped out on loan to Aston Villa. Garnacho went the opposite way, playing a part in every game after the derby victory bar the final day win over Villa.",

      "For all the poor decisions and mismanagement at Manchester United, perhaps one of the club's biggest problems is something they can do very little about.",
      "Countless players have arrived at Old Trafford and been swallowed up by the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. And when said players ultimately leave United and thrive elsewhere, little consideration is given to the fact their upturn in form may well be down to the reduced pressure levels at clubs where the spotlight isn't quite so intense.",
      "Of course, United might not be able to do anything about the pressure that comes with representing the club, but they can ensure the players they sign are ready to cope with the demands that come with pulling on that famous red shirt.",

      "It feels a long time ago that the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United began with a bang at Portman Road.",
      "Barley two minutes in and Marcus Rashford had scored for the Reds at Ipswich and prompted plenty to wonder whether he might prove the striker beneficiary in the central role in Amorim's set-up.",
      "Within a matter of months, Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa and he has no future at United. The decision to cast him aside is ultimately one for Amorim and it will likely still provoke debate while United continue to struggle in front of goal.",

      "Manchester United have struggled to find a prolific striker capable of successfully overcoming the weight that comes with leading the line at Old Trafford.",
      "Without Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcus Rashford, United have had many strikers come and fail. Edinson Cavani, despite seeming at the time to be prolific, scored just 19 goals whereas Antony Martial's difficulties ended in him leaving the club for nothing.",
      "Two years ago, United coughed up £72million to bring Rasmus Hojlund to the club. The then-20-year-old had scored 10 goals for Atalanta after five with Copenhagen and 12 at Sturm Graz. When you look at the numbers, it's quite remarkable that he cost so much.",
      "Following a season where he showed plenty of promise and clinical eye for goal, Hojlund struggled in his second campaign. The Denmark international scored just four Premier League goals and is one of the players United would happily sell this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha's signing from Wolves bolsters United's attack but the priority is adding to the Brazilian. Bryan Mbeumo is likely to be the next new face through the door but a centre-forward is expected to follow and it's difficult to know which one they want.",
      "Liam Delap was the first number one target before he signed for Chelsea and Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly targeting a move to Arsenal. There remains other targets like Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike, but United have been known for pulling off some outrageous deals.",
      "Previously, Harry Kane was United's number one target. It was reported that they failed to bring him to Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag prior to his move to Bayern Munich, deciding against spending £100m for one of the world's best to save £28m to sign Hojlund.",
      "Now 32, Kane has ended his wait for silverware at Bayern with the Bundesliga title. A return to England has been mooted in recent months and while it seems far-fetched to think of Kane walking out at Old Trafford, hear us out.",
      "According to respected outlet BILD, the German champions hold an interest in RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko. It's said they view the 22-year-old as Kane's long-term replacement and they could move for him this summer.",
      "Priced at £75m, Sesko is Arsenal's number one target after bagging 21 goals in spite of a disappointing season for Leipzig. Surprisingly, the report adds that should Sesko be signed, Bayern would bring Kane back into the number 10 role with his tendency to drop deep complimenting that.",
      "Sesko to the Allianz Arena has work to do with Arsenal claiming to 'hold the upper hand' but Bayern's pull in Germany is telling. If a move did materialise, it's not yet clear whether Kane would be happy with being moving away from centre-forward.",
      "Step forward, Jason Wilcox. The signing of Kane would come at the perfect time with Amorim desperate for a striker to hit the ground running.",
      "The issue with Gyokeres, Osimhen or Ekitike, they have zero Premier League experience. They all carry doubts over their heads that will come as a concern, whereas Kane has scored 213 goals - 47 goals behind Alan Shearer.",
      "Whether United would entertain the prospect of signing Kane, or whether the England international would be open to returning to England. However, if Bayern do pull off a deal for Sesko, it would be the perfect green light for United to swoop in and bring in the ready-made goalscorer needed."

      "It was claimed that Gyokeres was keen to sign for the Gunners with the lure of Champions League football thought to be enough to sway him. However on Sunday, Arsenal were thought to be pulling away from the deal after it emerged that Sporting were unwilling to budge on their £68m release clause.",
      "The Swede's camp insist that Sporting made a gentleman's agreement with Gyokeres to allow him to depart Lisbon for just shy of £60m. However, according to Record, the north London club were now looking at Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins as an option.",
      "Amidst all this drama, it appears that Juve are looking to capitalise. Corriere dello Sport understand that the Turin club are looking to take advantage of the uncertainty and, after speaking with Gyokeres' representatives, would be willing to offer him an £11m per year contract which breaks down to roughly £211,000 per month.",
      "Unfortunately for Juventus, they do hit a hurdle in their pursuit of Gyokeres as it first rests on their current striker Dusan Vlahovic being sold. Despite scoring 15 goals this season, Juve are looking to offload the striker due to his unwillingness to lower his wage to allign with the club's new salary structure.",

      "Of his 27 goals, 21 were plundered in the Bundesliga, meaning only Harry Kane scored more goals in the German top flight in the most recent campaign.",
      "Schick has been a fairly reliable source of goals in recent seasons, scoring 81 times in 168 games for Leverkusen. He scored 13 times in 33 games in 2023/24.",
      "With two years remaining on his Leverkusen contract, the Bundesliga outfit, who recently appointed former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag as their new boss, will not feel pressured into selling the Czech Republic international this summer. It has been claimed that if he does not leave the BayArena, he could be offered a contract extension.",
      "Although the report has not stated which clubs have enquired about signing the striker, who will turn 30 next January, he could be a realistic option for United to try and strengthen the tip of their attack this summer.",
      "The Reds are desperate to recruit a new No.9 and their search currently offers no obvious answer. They are being linked with a catalogue of strikers and the latest to have joined the list is Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike, who scored 15 Bundesliga goals in 2024/25.",
      "United are also continuing to be heavily linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. However, none of the aforementioned players will come cheaply.",
      "However, despite his impressive record in 2024/25, Schick is unlikely to find himself categorised in the same bracket as Ekitike, Gyokeres and Osimhen, not least because he is slightly older and his record in front of goal has not been as prolific in comparison to Gyokeres' and Osimhen's.",
      "Despite scoring 40 goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, the 2022/23 season saw him score just four goals in 23 games, although his campaign was ravaged by injury issues. The season prior, though, he scored 24 times in 27 Bundesliga outings.",
      "United, despite signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and wanting to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal that could be worth a similar fee, do not have a bottomless pit to rely on this summer, meaning their hopes of landing a new No.9 are set to rely on raising funds via player sales.",
      "However, Schick is unlikely to command a fee as extravagant as what the likes of Gyokeres, Osimhen or Ekitike would. On the flip side, though, the Leverkusen striker is not held as high esteem as the aforementioned trio and will turn 30 next year."

      "Here is how we rated the players out of ten:",
      "Joe Hart",
      "He was rarely troubled by a blunt World XI attack. He made one routine catch in a very quiet first half at his end of the pitch and was taken off at the break. 6",
      "Louis Tomlinson",
      "The One Direction star was the subject of cheers every time he got the ball. He started at right-back and regularly got forward on the overlap. 6",
      "Gary Neville",
      "The former United skipper started at centre-back and he didn't have much defending to do in the first half. 6",
      "Angry Ginge",
      "The United fan, who started at centre-back, produced an outstanding goal-line clearance to somehow keep out a chipped effort from Rivaldo in the first half. He also got the assist for Defoe's opener. 8",
      "Tom Grennan",
      "He started at left-back and went close to scoring England's second just minutes after Rooney's opener when he motored forward and bent a shot just over the bar. He regularly got forward and wanted to get on the ball. He also showed a willingness to win possession back. 7",
      "Jill Scott",
      "Captained England from the start and played with a trademark smile on her face. Carried the ball forward a few times from midfield before going off with just over 30 minutes on the clock. 6",
      "Michael Carrick",
      "Sat at the base of England's midfield, the former United midfielder bossed proceedings, picking out passes he so often did in his playing days. He played a superb pass to set Toni Duggan free to double England's lead. 7",
      "Jack Wilshere",
      "He started just behind Rooney and was awarded a free role. He delivered the cross that led to the opening goal and he enjoyed plenty of the ball after that. He popped up everywhere with possession and hit the post in the closing stages. 8",
      "James Nelson-Joyce",
      "Started on the right was arguably England's quietest player in the first half. He was replaced not long before half-time. 4",
      "Wayne Rooney",
      "The former United star opened the scoring with less than five minutes on the clock after finding himself in the right place at the right time to capitalise on a cross that wasn't dealt with. He linked up nicely with Wilshere throughout the opening half. 7",
      "Bella Ramsey",
      "Started on the left flank and huffed and puffed in the hope of getting on the ball and make something happen. Offered as much as energy as possible before going off after 21 minutes. 4",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Toni Duggan",
      "Stepped off the bench and doubled England's lead on the stroke of half-time when she slotted a clinical finish past Edwin van der Sar. She timed her run to perfection to latch onto Carrick's pass. 7",
      "Paddy McGuinness",
      "After replacing Hart at the break, McGuinness was haunted by Tevez, who put four goals past him. He didn't cover himself in much glory. 4",
      "Jermain Defoe",
      "The former England striker scored twice after coming on at half-time, moving him level with Kem Cetinay at the top of the Soccer Aid scoring charts. His first goal was an emphatic finish and his second was a cool poke beyond Nicky Byrne. 8",
      "Aaron Lennon",
      "He rolled back the years by reminding everyone of his pace. The former Tottenham Hotspur man could have had two assists within minutes of coming on. 7",
      "Edwin van der Sar",
      "The legendary Dutchman was beaten twice in the first half, and he will not want to see the first goal back. He was unable to get his hands on Wilshere's cross after Nemanja Vidic tried to beat him to the same ball. He was taken off at half-time. 5",
      "Tony Bellew",
      "He was forced off with an apparent injury with just six minutes on the clock. N/A",
      "Nemanja Vidic",
      "Attempted to go for Wilshere's cross alongside Van der Sar and got caught out. However, he settled into the game and tried to help the World XI get up the pitch as much as he could. 5",
      "Richard Gadd",
      "The star of Baby Reindeer could not keep up with Duggan when she went scampering free to double England's lead. 4",
      "Harry Kewell",
      "The former Liverpool man's evening was over after just 15 minutes before being replaced by John O'Shea. He had a few touches of the ball but didn't do anything of note. 4",
      "Dermot Kennedy",
      "Tried a shot from distance five minutes before half-time that did not look all that far away from the top corner on second viewing. It was his only notable moment in the first half. 5",
      "Asim Chaudhry",
      "He was substituted after just over 20 minutes following a relatively low-key performance with few highlights. 4",
      "Kheira Hamraoui",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star tried to make things happen for the World XI and she had a couple of attempts at goal, the first of which was an inventive lob that required a comfortable save from Hart in the England goal. 6",
      "Diamond",
      "The Gladiators star lined up in attack that featured two former World Cup winners. She had a few touches of the ball, but her one foray forward was stopped by an excellent challenge from Angry Ginge. 5",
      "David Trezeguet",
      "A World Cup winner with France in 1998, the former striker had a fairly quiet first half, with England dominating. He flashed a shot wide not long before the break and went off not long after the break. 5",
      "Rivaldo",
      "One of the most famous names on the pitch, the Brazilian, now 53, lacked pace to make things happen as often as would have liked. However, he was unlucky not to make it 1-1. 6",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Nicky Byrne",
      "Brought on at half-time and made a terrific double save less than two minutes in, denying Defoe and Bartlett when it looked easier for them both to score. He then got booked just moments later for handling the ball outside the box. 8",
      "Carlos Tevez",
      "The Argentine came on at half-time and helped himself to four goals in less than 15 second half minutes, inspiring an impressive second half comeback. His quartet of goals featured a cool finish at the end of a jinking run and a well-placed free-kick. 10",
      "Robbie Keane",
      "The former Tottenham man is a seasoned Soccer Aid star and the World XI benefitted from his experience up front. He provided the assist for Tevez's opener and was a real nuisance. 7",
      "Big Zuu",
      "An unlikely match-winner. He curled a smart finish past McGuinness, who made a theatrical attempt to keep it out of the net. 7"

      "After stepping off the bench at the half-time interval, the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker helped himself to four goals, including an excellent free-kick, before Big Zuu netted the winner in the closing stages.",
      "England had led 2-0 at half-time at half-time via goals from Wayne Rooney and Toni Duggan before adding a third ten minutes into the second half through Jermain Defoe. The latter then scored again to make it 4-2, claiming a record-equalling fifth Soccer Aid goal.",

      "He linked up with Lennon again and stabbed the ball past Byrne.",
      "The comeback really is on now. Tevez gets his second goal in as many minutes, picking the ball up just inside the England half and driving through the England defence before slotting past McGuinness. He made that look easy.",
      "The World XI are back in the game - and it's Tevez on his former stomping ground. Keane flicks the ball into his path and he slots an effortless finish into the corner.",
      "Game on.",
      "England get the third goal their start to the second half has deserved! Defoe rifles in from inside the box after Angry Ginge flicked the ball into his path with a header.",
      "England have started the second half really well and are looking to add a third goal. Former Tottenham Hotspur duo Defoe and Lennon have linked up nicely a couple of times.",
      "That was outstanding from celebrity goalkeeper Byrne in the World XI net. Lennon gets down the flank, sends in a low cross for Defoe, who is denied, before Bartlett, on the rebound, is also denied.",

      "Inter Milan have made Rasmus Hojlund their primary target this summer, according to reports over in Italy, while Manchester United are reportedly open to a quick sale.",
      "The Denmark striker's future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain, with a move back to Serie A on the cards just two seasons after he joined United from Atalanta for £64million. After two underwhelming campaigns, the 22-year-old could be sold for nearly half of what the club originally paid, it has been said.",
      "Both Inter Milan and Napoli have shown interest in Hojlund, but Gazzetta dello Sport now reckon that Inter have moved ahead in the race and have made him their number one target.",
      "They explained the situation using Hojlund's Tour de France friend, Jonas Vingegaard, as a metaphor, where they wrote: \"Hojlund has climbed on the pedals, as if he were his compatriot Jonas Vingegaard, a champion of the bike and winner of two Tours.",
      "\"Now, he's ahead of everyone in the club's preferences for the attack of the future; there is finally room for an investment up front and, at the moment, nowhere seems to deserve it more.\"",
      "Inter Milan are reportedly working on the deal, while competing in the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. Hojlund is said to be intrigued by the idea of joining the Italian giants.",
      "As per Corriere dello Sport, United have set Hojlund's price tag between €40million-€45million (£34million-£38.3million) - less than half the original fee. The club are eager to raise funds quickly, for their own summer business, which includes mooted targets like Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen.",
      "Interestingly, Corriere also claim that United have chosen to keep Joshua Zirkzee over Hojlund, despite the Denmark forward finishing last season with three more goal involvements than the Dutchman. Both players, however, had relatively quiet 2024/2525 campaigns.",
      "While United are reportedly seeking a straight cash sale, Inter Milan favour a loan deal - with an obligation to buy. The decision now lies with United head coach Ruben Amorim, who must determine whether Hojlund remains part of his long-term vision."

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "The two Red Devils icons will be part of the star-studded cast returning to Old Trafford on Sunday evening to help raise funds for Unicef through a charitable football match. Though they shared great success during their time together in the Premier League, Scholes and Vidic find themselves on opposing sides for Soccer Aid.",
      "Scholes will stand with fellow English legends Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Gary Neville against Vidic's World XI team, featuring John O'Shea, Carlos Tevez and Edwin van der Sar. While the event promises to be an entertaining showdown between old teammates and celebrities, Scholes' previous remarks on Vidic suggest he may be a little anxious on coming up against him.",
      "The Serbian defender was known for his robust style and no-nonsense approach during his stint at United. Previously speaking to the UTD podcast about what Vidic was like to play alongside, the 50-year-old said: \"I was fairly good at tackling. It was all calculated. I was just getting people back. That's all I was doing.",
      "\"I never instigated. If someone got me, there's a chance I'd get them back. Vida [Vidic] had some tackles in the box, he could be a lunatic,\" reports the Mirror.",
      "He added: \"He didn't play as a centre half in five-a-side. He was one of those defenders that thought he could play a bit as a No. 10. You know what I mean?",
      "\"When you get to a five-a-side he does anything but play in his position, 'Give it to me' all that stuff. But when it came to a match he would head and kick everything.",
      "\"In training he could be a bit moody and a nuisance in the box especially but a great centre half. He was perfect for English football. He could head the ball, tackle, he was great, a really good player.\"",
      "After quickly establishing a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand upon arriving at Old Trafford in 2006, Vidic made 300 appearances for the Red Devils, winning five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League. Vidic left United in 2014 to join Inter Milan, before retiring from an illustrious career in January 2016.",
      "Scholes, on the other hand, spent his entire professional football career with United, scoring 155 goals and providing 82 assists in 716 games, primarily as a central midfielder. Alongside Vidic, he is among a host of well-known names who will participate in Soccer Aid on Sunday, including content creators like Morgan Burtwhistle (AKA AngryGinge) and fellow athletes like Sir Mo Farah and Tony Bellew.",
      "Football enthusiasts can watch all the action live on ITV1 and ITVX from 6pm onwards. The match is scheduled to kick off at 7:30pm."

      "When Manchester United slumped to eighth in the table, only managing to secure European football thanks to their FA Cup triumph, it was clear that their blunt attack was their main issue and that it needed to be addressed in the transfer market.",
      "Only six players in the entire squad managed to score more than two league goals all season. One of those six players was sold in Scott McTominay, another was shipped out on loan during the mid-season window in Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo can't even get into the starting XI.",
      "Of the five major signings United made in the 2024 summer window, three of them were defenders and one was a defensive midfielder. Joshua Zirkzee represented the only attacking arrival, yet his haul of 13 goals in two years in Serie A hardly suggested he would be the answer to United's goalscoring woes.",
      "Did they really expect things to get any better? If they did then they'll have been very disappointed.",
      "Things only got worse in the 2024/25 season, with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee - the club's two senior centre forwards - managing just seven league goals between them. United scored 13 goals fewer last season than they managed in 2023/24, recording a -10 goal difference as they finished 15th in the table, having looked set to finish just one place above the relegation zone at one point.",
      "Not strengthening their forward line last summer really was a huge mistake, but it's a mistake Ruben Amorim is looking to rectify this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha's arrival following his 15-goal haul with Wolves in the Premier League already makes the frontline picture look a little brighter. And if Bryan Mbeumo arrives - the league's fourth-highest goalscorer last season - things will be looking even better.",
      "And then there's the big question of who will lead the line next season.",
      "United are determined to sign a striker, with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen two of the names continuing to be linked with the club. Both are regular goalscorers and would help to sharpen a very blunt attack.",

      "Manchester United face their most pivotal transfer window in recent memory after a disastrous campaign.",
      "Losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th spot in the Premier League means that there will be no European football at Old Trafford for the first time in over a decade. It means United's task of rebuilding under Ruben Amorim has become that little bit harder, for multiple reasons.",
      "The transfer window opened initially for 10 days - from June 1 to June 10 - to allow the clubs competing in the Club World Cup to strengthen their squads before the tournament began. The Reds used that opportunity to secure the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "And with the transfer window reopening in a couple of days, Isaac Seelochan has taken a look at what a best-case summer would look like for Amorim and the Reds.",
      "United's main focus should be on snapping-up a striker to try and solve their goal-scoring problems. The Reds have reportedly entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike and, with Liverpool and Chelsea also said to be interested, his signing would be a huge coup.",
      "Frankfurt are said to be demanding around £85million (€100million) for Ekitike, who has four years left on his deal. Negotiating a much lower fee will be needed, but it's a deal United should be pursuing.",
      "Elsewhere, with Amorim being backed to turn things around, the Reds will need better quality wing-backs to suit his system. Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo would be a great signing and a massive upgrade on United's current options in that position.",
      "Midfield will need strengthening due to Casemiro's age, Mason Mount's injury record and Christian Eriksen's departure. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is one of the brightest English midfielders around at the moment.",
      "Wharton is a Premier League regular for the Eagles, who played a huge role in their shock FA Cup win. The 21-year-old is also an England international who has been to a major tournament with the Three Lions. Ineos appears to be targeting young stars at Old Trafford, and he fits the bill perfectly.",
      "Another area of concern is between the posts, with both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır struggling badly last season. Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma was excellent in the Champions League-winning campaign and has been linked with a move to M16.",
      "Getting transfer fees for the players who spent much of last season on loan will be a necessity. Marcus Rashford's homegrown status will mean any sale represents pure profit and a much-needed PSR boost.",
      "Selling Rashford to Barcelona would be ideal, as the Reds would avoid the possible embarrassment of him coming back to haunt his former side anytime soon, at least domestically.",
      "Antony enjoyed the best season out of United's loanees and a permanent move to Spain would be perfect for all parties. Matching United's valuation is likely to be an issue for most Spanish clubs, but a switch to Atletico Madrid has been mooted.",
      "Jadon Sancho will be tricky to shift, though, after Chelsea paid the Reds around £5million to avoid signing him on a permanent deal. Again, a move abroad would be ideal, but clubs may struggle to match United's valuation, after his average loan spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "If a new goalkeeper joins, it seems unlikely that Onana will stay. It will be difficult for anyone to match his reported £26million valuation, but selling him needs to be looked at.",
      "Finally, with it appearing that Alejandro Garnacho faces no future under Amorim, getting a reasonably fee for the young star would be a massive boost. Like Rashford, his homegrown status will hand the club some wriggle room with so many new signings needed."

      "United are, however, working on a deal to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The player is keen to sign for the club, with United expected to pay a fee in the region of around £60 million if a deal is completed."

      "Manchester United have made an eye-catching start to the summer transfer window by securing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "The Brazilian international officially joined United earlier this week and after scoring 17 goals for Wolves last season he should add some much needed firepower to the club's ranks.",
      "Cunha will slot into one of the attacking midfield roles in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and United are hopeful Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will also arrive to play alongside him.",

      "But it is perhaps a summer signing that was agreed back in January that could prove to be one of the biggest steals of this window.",
      "United announced the signing of Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon for an initial £3.3million that could rise to £7million in add-ons and he will officially join the club on July 1.",
      "In that time, the 18-year-old has continued to play regularly for Cerro Porteno in the Paraguayan top flight, picking up invaluable experience of first team football.",

      "Nobody is expecting him to match the heights of United's record goalscorer, not least because they play in different positions, but the parallels between Leon's impact on senior football at such a tender age and his look and stature with Rooney's meteoric rise at Everton are there for all to see.",
      "Leon plays as a left-wing-back and he will, of course, have to force his way past Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass in the pecking order.",
      "It is more likely he will play with the under-21s to begin with but Amorim has shown he is not afraid to throw in youngsters when they are ready, handing debuts to teenagers Amass, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven this season.",
      "If Leon can deliver on his promise it will be the first success story of Ineos prioritising the signing of young players with high potential and low transfer fees.",
      "And that prospect should excite United fans."

      "It includes some absolutely massive names, but none at Liverpool now. And no Leroy Sane as he has agreed to join Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "20) Victor Lindelof (Manchester United)\nThe most valuable of those departing United on a free this summer, the Swede has enjoyed very mixed fortunes over eight years at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "19) Akram Afif (Al-Sadd)\nAs close at it comes to a Qatari superstar.",
      "",
      "18) Callum Wilson (Newcastle United)\nTalks are ongoing with the club, but the 33-year-old will surely want to play some regular football before he retires.",
      "",
      "17) Junior Firpo (Leeds United)\nThe Yorkshire club want him to stay but Real Betis are among the clubs interested in the Dominican Republic international.",
      "",
      "16) Nelson Semedo (Wolves)\nWolves are in danger of losing half their best players with the Portuguese right-back linked with a Manchester United switch.",
      "",
      "15) Roony Bardghji (FC Copenhagen)\nHe’s been injured for almost as long as he has been linked with Tottenham.",
      "",
      "14) Marco Verratti (Al-Arabi)\nWill he take more money in the Middle East or head back to Europe for a final hurrah?",

      "",
      "12) Nelson Weiper (Mainz)\nThe club have an option for another year that will surely be triggered for the striker.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "10) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He claims he is staying in Saudi.",
      "",
      "9) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "8) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "7) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",

      "",
      "3) Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nInitially reluctant to commit himself to the unstable Toffees and will likely have his pick of mid-table Premier League clubs on a free transfer. Tottenham are said to be very predictably interested as well as Manchester United.",
      "",
      "2) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nThe ball-playing centre-half looks bound for Brighton despite some interest from Inter.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",
      "An actual footballer can learn a foreign language?! If you’re surprised, maybe you’re the thick one…",
      "Former Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane has revealed why he rejected an offer from Arsenal to move to Galatasaray on a free transfer this summer.",
      "Arsenal reportedly asked a Bundesliga star to ‘wait’ for them, but he is now ‘on the verge’ of making a move to a side who have come out of nowhere ...",
      "Bayern want to keep Leroy Sane for the Club World Cup and have made PSG star Bradley Barcola their ‘top target’, according to reports.",

      "Football clubs and their owners are not shy in splashing the cash and while sometimes it can work out, there are just as many times when the same decision-makers have had to cut their losses and sell for a huge financial hit.",
      "Here then are 10 Premier League players who cost their clubs a whole lot of money that they would never see again…",
      "",
      "Nicolas Pepe at Arsenal\nKicking off this list is one-time wunderkind Nicolas Pepe for whom Arsenal paid an eye-watering £72m in the summer of 2019.",
      "A sizeable haul of 37 goals and 18 assists at Lille convinced Unai Emery and the Arsenal board to part with the not-inconsiderable money but Pepe would never recapture that form at the Emirates.",
      "His first season saw him score 16 times in 47 appearances but he followed that with just one goal in the entire 2021/22 league campaign.",
      "The following season, Arsenal sent him out on loan to Nice before the Gunners terminated his deal in 2023, allowing him to move to Super Lig side Trabzonspor on a free.",
      "Loss: £72m",
      "",
      "Fernando Torres at Chelsea\nHe had established himself as one of the best strikers in the world, but there were already signs of Fernando Torres’ decline before he made the switch to Chelsea.",
      "The London club parted with £50m, making him the British transfer record and sixth most expensive player of all time, but he started his career at Stamford Bridge by going 903 minutes without a goal, including a memorable miss at Old Trafford where he rounded David de Gea only to blast his shot wide past an empty net.",
      "When the goal eventually came, it proved to be his only one of the 2010/11 season and from there, his stock rapidly fell.",
      "No more than eight league goals in a year from 2011 to 2014 meant Chelsea were happy to ship Torres out on loan to Milan and then Atletico before letting him go for free.",
      "Loss: £50m",
      "",
      "Sebastien Haller at West Ham\nWhen Sebastian Haller started banging them in for fun at Borussia Dortmund, West Ham fans must have been wondering where that particular player was hiding when he was in east London.",
      "The Hammers spent £45m on the Frenchman having seen him score 51 in 98 for Utrecht and then 33 in 77 for Eintracht Frankfurt, but those goals quickly dried up in the graveyard of strikers.",
      "Signing a five-year deal, he was sold for a 58% loss just 18 months later.",
      "Loss: £26.2m",
      "",
      "Romelu Lukaku at Chelsea\nLukaku to Chelsea may well go down as one of the worst pieces of transfer business of all time; not only did they break the bank for him, but they soon found him in open revolt.",
      "After a title-winning season with Inter, Chelsea opted to bring Lukaku back to the Bridge for his second stint, but having found himself at odds with Thomas Tuchel’s tactics, Lukaku took to the media to criticise his manager and the club.",
      "He said he was “not happy” and hoped to return to Inter, which saw him dropped from the squad entirely. One public apology later and the Belgian was back playing but a year later, he was sent out on loan to Inter with a fee of £6.9m.",
      "In 2023, he moved to Roma before signing permanently for Napoli in 2024. Despite recouping €30m, it remains an enormous loss compared to the price they paid for him.",
      "Loss: £72.3m",
      "",
      "Eliaquim Mangala at Manchester City\nA fee of £43m made Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the world, and yet he really was terrible at defending during his stint at Manchester City.",
      "He made just 11 league appearances in his first season but that number dropped to zero the following year when a knee injury kept him out for 263 days.",
      "Upon his return, he was shipped out on loan to Valencia in 2016 before joining Everton in 2018.",
      "The French centre-back made 79 appearances across his five-year contract at the Etihad but left on a free in August 2019.",
      "Loss: £43m",
      "",
      "Paul Pogba at Manchester United\nPaul Pogba being eighth on the all-time most expensive Premier League transfers despite being almost a decade ago, tells you everything about the luxurious nature of this purchase.",
      "Having had him in the academy, United had the ultimate case of sellers’ remorse as they brought the World Cup winner back to the club at great expense, but he never found a natural position in the team and could not match the performances he put in at Juventus.",
      "His attitude also rubbed plenty up the wrong way and Pogba’s passenger-like appearances made him a figure of frustration for both fans and managers.",
      "In June 2022, United opted to let Pogba’s contract run out, meaning they had lost £89.3 million after just six seasons.",
      "Loss: £89.3m",
      "",
      "Donny van de Beek at Manchester United\nPart of the talented Ajax side that reached the Champions League quarter-finals, Donny van de Beek would come to be the ghost of Old Trafford.",
      "United paid £35m for the Dutchman but he made just four starts in the league before not even managing one in the next campaign, raising the question of why the club even bothered to buy him.",
      "As managers came and went, none of them seemed to like the look of Van de Beek with the midfielder playing just nine minutes in 10 Premier League matches.",
      "In January 2022, United cut their losses by sending him out on loan to Everton before another loan stint at Eintracht Frankfurt. The latter deal involved an option to buy at €11 million which the German club passed on, meaning he joined La Liga side Girona for relative pennies in July 2024.",
      "Loss: £32.5m",
      "",
      "Timo Werner at Chelsea\nHaving finished the 2019/20 season as the Bundesliga’s second top scorer, there was a lot of expectation on Timo Werner when he joined Chelsea for £47.5 million.",
      "He was part of Chelsea’s Champions League-winning side but never found the same fluency in west London. In 2022, Chelsea opted to sell Werner back to Leipzig for a £25.3m fee (they were lucky to get that) but even that was a great loss.",
      "Loss: £22.2m",
      "",
      "Angel di Maria at Manchester United\nWith Moyes out and Van Gaal in, there was a sense of optimism back at Old Trafford in the summer of 2014 and the good vibes only increased when the club announced the signing of Angel di Maria, a player who had just been named man of the match in the Champions League final.",
      "But Di Maria never settled into life in Manchester. Even as he signed, he said he never wanted to leave Madrid and despite a bright start, Di Maria’s form fell away during the winter months.",
      "A hamstring injury restricted him to one substitute appearance in seven games before he picked up a red card in March for grabbing the shirt of referee Michael Oliver.",
      "With his wife calling Manchester a “s***hole”, it came as no surprise to see Di Maria move to Paris just a year later.",
      "Loss: £15.7m",

      "Mario Balotelli to Liverpool\nWhen Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were faced with the impossible task of replacing Luis Suarez, there turned (eventually and reluctantly) to…Mario Balotelli.",
      "After returning to Italy following his Manchester City spell, Balotelli was pulled back into the Premier League but when his career there began with Rodgers admitting the striker was not his first choice, it summed up just how his Anfield stint would go.",
      "While there were not the fireworks in the toilet of Balotelli’s previous time in England, the striker did get himself into a fair bit of trouble including posting antisemitic images on social media and swapping shirts with Pepe at half time in the match against Real Madrid, something Rodgers said “shouldn’t happen here”.",
      "He scored his first goal in his 13th appearance but that would be just one of four and he was out the door the following year.",

      "Paul Pogba has reportedly ‘held talks’ with a Champions League club after opening up on the “hell” of a doping ban which kept him out of football for 18 months.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists the Red Devils sold former Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku too after he won the Serie A title with Napoli.",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke."

      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho leaving Manchester United to reunite with a former boss will be “complicated.”",
      "Garnacho’s future is almost certain to be away from United. He caused a stir when he complained about having a small role in the Europa League final – which United lost – and then called the season sh*t.",
      "Following that, on the Red Devils’ post-season tour of Southeast Asia, Ruben Amorim reportedly told him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It has since been reported that the United boss has weakened the club’s negotiating position, as sides are aware he wants rid of Garnacho, so won’t pay the asking price, aware the Manchester outfit will probably accept less than they’d initially hoped for.",
      "One of the sides interested in Garnacho are Bayer Leverkusen, with Erik ten Hag – who managed the winger at Old Trafford – recently becoming their boss.",
      "According to transfer insider Romano, that move to reunite the pair will not be an easy one to be pulled off.",
      "He said on X that Garnacho’s ‘priority is to remain in the Premier League,’ while he’s expected to leave United. Despite Leverkusen’s ‘interest and and Ten Hag’s appreciation, the deal looks complicated’.",
      "It has previously been suggested that Chelsea is the United man’s preferred destination. Indeed, he has reportedly told his agent to make it clear that he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge this summer.",
      "But Romano has reported there’s not a massively high chance that move goes through. He recently stated there is a ’35 per cent chance’ that Garnacho does move to the Blues.",
      "In the same report, he suggested the United man ‘could stay in the Premier League’.",
      "Indeed, that is his preference, but if no clubs in England make an offer, but sides elsewhere offer United what they want, it seems they will waste no time in getting Garnacho off the books.",
      "Whether that is Leverkusen remains to be seen, as the likes of Napoli, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with the Argentine, too.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish’s proposed move from Manchester City to Napoli hinges on Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "Man Utd have to get busy with new signings but confidence in their ability to raise money through sales seems as woefully misplaced as ever.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Jack Grealish is being ‘lined up’ for a move overseas and could impact one Liverpool transfer this summer.",

I think a striker with experience, knows his right way around the football field, who the young ones they’ve invested in, like Hojlund and Zirkzee and Chido [Obi] can learn from.”",
      "On Gyokeres, he added: “I think Gyokeres, everyone’s talking about him. Again, I think if I’m looking at the market now and I had to pick him or [Victor] Osimhen, I’d probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.",
      "“And he’s shown he’s done it in multiple leagues now. And he’s done it internationally as well. I think he’s a top-class number nine who, again, the young players will be able to learn from.

Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.

      "The Red Devils could do a lot worse than Mora as they scour the market for alternatives to top target Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham, but will have to pay a similar fee for the 18-year-old, with Porto inserting a €70m [£59m] release clause into his new contract.",

      "Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nLiverpool are reportedly considering Ramos as a fall-back option should they fail to land any of their top targets – we’ve ranked ten of them – and PSG have also ‘offered’ him to United for £50m, which can’t have felt good for a striker with a more than reasonable goalscoring record for the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "And we wonder whether United should climb down from a high horse which has seen them make a failed attempt for Viktor Gyokeres ahead of various other doomed bids for elite strikers and consider a move for a guy whose 32 goals for PSG have come at a rate of one every 109 minutes when they’re current leading No.9 has scored 26 at a significantly reduced lick of one every 246 minutes.",

Interest from Barcelona was eschewed in favour of a move to Red Bull Salzburg, but he has since been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and, most recently, Aston Villa.",

      "Inter have already been credited with interest in Delgado, who describes himself as a dynamic, tactically minded player, who loves to steal the ball from the opposition, which sounds like precisely what Manchester United hoped they were signing in Manuel Ugarte and explains why they too have been linked with the teenager with Ugarte failing to meet that expectation.",

      "Here are 10 top stoppers we think might be gettable…",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nDonnarumma’s agent will have you believe the Italy keeper is available because he needs more leverage on contract talks with PSG, who want to keep their current custodian, but not at any cost.",
      "Of course, Manchester United’s name has been mentioned because that’s the oldest trick in the agents’ book, but Donnarumma himself said his priority is to renew with PSG. But only if he gets paid.",
      "",
      "9) Nick Pope (Newcastle)\nEddie Howe clearly isn’t entirely convinced by Pope given he’s trying again to sign James Trafford from Burnley. Newcastle want us to believe that Trafford would be arriving to compete for the No.1 position, but the new boy is not likely to make that move at this point in his career without a certain level of assurance. Which suggests Pope’s days as first choice are numbered; there would be considerable interest from other Premier League clubs in need of an experienced England international.",
      "",
      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester)\nThe 25-year-old keeper was one of very few to emerge with a smidgen of credit from a miserable season at the King Power. At least the Dane had ample opportunity to show what he can do – only Ipswich and Southampton allowed more shots on their goal.",
      "Before demonstrating that he could stay at the highest level while Leicester return to the Championship, Hermansen played a big role in the Foxes’ promotion to the Premier League. Brentford were linked before they found a bargain in Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "",
      "7) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton)\nRamsdale’s move to Southampton last summer made you wonder if the England keeper actually enjoys being relegated. Were there really no other better offers? Perhaps not, given the daft sod once openly admitted to struggling with concentration, but when his mind is on the job, Ramsdale remains a very good keeper. West Ham were sniffing and he feels like a good fit for Leeds.",
      "💷 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever: Chelsea shamed but Arsenal evolution clear",
      "",
      "6) Marcin Bulka (Nice)\nThe Nice no.1 has told the French club he fancies a move this summer, which they will be keen to facilitate since the Pole has only a year remaining on a contract he almost certainly won’t renew.",
      "The 6ft 6in giant, who began his career at Chelsea and went via PSG to Nice, has been catching eyes across Europe, and obviously Manchester United have been linked. But the Red Devils will have to wait until January since UEFA banned them doing any business with INEOS stable mate Nice until after this summer window.",
      "",
      "5) Vanja Milinkovic-Savic (Torino)\nThe Serbian stopper began his career as a youth player at Manchester United and he has been linked with a move to Old Trafford – maybe we should just assume that to be the case for all these keepers unless stated – after three solid seasons in Torino’s sticks. AC Milan, though, seem to be the frontrunners, with an agreement in place to pay the 28-year-old’s £17million release clause if they lose Mike Maignan.",
      "Only two keepers in Europe’s top five leagues performed better in relation to their expected goals against than Milinkovic-Savic, who conceded 11.4 goals fewer than the algorithms expected him to.",
      "",
      "4) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nWidely proclaimed as the best goalkeeper in the world but, more accurately in our view, he was the goalkeeper for the best team in the world. Argentina, that is, not Villa. That doesn’t mean he isn’t very, very good, and he would be an asset to any team looking for a stopper this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been linked, and he’d certainly be an upgrade, but Villa don’t have to give him away, even if they are the club in most PSR peril.",
      "",
      "3) Lucas Chevalier (Lille)\nIf Villa sell Martinez, then Chevalier is said to be high on their list of potential replacements. Though that plan could be scuppered by PSG if they can’t reach an agreement with Donnarumma and sell the Italy keeper to a club more willing to meet his massive wage demands.",
      "At 23, Chevalier conceded 7.3 goals fewer than xG suggests he should last season, with Manchester City said to be keen on the France call-up.",
      "",
      "2) Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid)\nIt seems Lunin is open to exploring his options away from Real’s bench because we have to assume he’s given up on ever replacing Thibaut Courtois as No.1. The penny should have dropped when Courtous returned from injury for the 2024 Champions League final when Lunin had played most of the season.",
      "Apparently, Real are open to selling the Ukraine stopper for £20m-25million, with the 26-year-old said to be on the radar of a host of top clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Mike Maignan (AC Milan)\nThe France No.1 is a year from the end of his contract and seemingly intent on leaving AC Milan after growing tired of the lack of progress in negotiations over a new deal. All of which presented a great opportunity for Chelsea to upgrade their goalkeeping option, none of which Enzo Maresca is happy with, but the Blues refused to take their opportunity.",
      "Milan apparently want around £21million but Chelsea were prepared to go no higher than £12million. Chelsea blew a clear run at Maignan, which should alert a number of big clubs. But here is the one keeper Manchester United haven’t been linked with, when they really should be.",

      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nAs far back as August 2017, Sancho has been on the Manchester United radar. Borussia Dortmund’s ability to grant the ambitious young forward a clear first-team pathway meant they secured the Manchester City academy talent but his immediate burst onto the Bundesliga scene only crystallised interest from back home.",
      "For each of the subsequent years until he finally arrived at Old Trafford in 2021, Sancho was frequently linked to a club hoping to build around a youthful British core; Manchester United even ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the England forward 12 months before he actually moved.",
      "But Sancho has been nothing close to the wait. Even during his “freedom” from 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for Manchester United, Chelsea paid £5m to specifically not sign him permanently.",
      "This place will belong to Florian Wirtz soon enough.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Manchester United (x3), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1), Liverpool (x1)",
      "Total cost: £962.9m",

      "And it’s no wonder Sporting want to ramp up the asking price if, as A BOLA claim, Cetinkaya is due 10 per cent of any rejected proposal which exceeds €60m thanks to a particularly cunning ‘sales mandate’ the agent ensured was part of his contract.",

      "The second part of the summer transfer window has reopened - and there is still more business to be done before it closes on September 1.",
      "Few knew what to expect from the special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it delivered 10 days of transfer drama and has now set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer.",
      "Manchester City were the big spenders after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on the first window's Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of AC Milan goalkeeper Maignan and ran out of time to conclude a deal for Dortmund forward Gittens.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he left Dortmund's training ground as Deadline Day drew to a close.",

      "Other deals were announced in between windows, with Mathys Tel completing a £30m permanent move to Spurs and Leeds signing Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg on an initial two-year deal.",
      "Premier League clubs splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "City were the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side looked to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, having spent a table-topping £116.3m so far.",

      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Dortmund for £32m and City also sold Yan Couto to the Bundesliga club for £25m.",

      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left winger is another priority, with Real's Rodrygo among the list of targets. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the Spaniard's £5m release clause.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees have turned down their opening £55m bid, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the Cameroon forward, valued at more than £60m.",

      "Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker. Gyokeres is one of their targets up front and approaches have been made for the Sporting frontman through intermediaries, although recent reports in Portugal claim the player would prefer a move to Arsenal.",
      "United have also entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike - who is also interesting Liverpool and Chelsea - according to Sky in Germany. However, it will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan, but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "United's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad having appointed Thomas Frank to replace the sacked Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south-coast club.",

      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",
