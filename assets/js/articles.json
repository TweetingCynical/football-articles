      "Manchester United are accelerating discussions over the release dates for the Africa Cup of Nations for Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui. The trio could miss up to eight Premier League matches and the third round of the FA Cup, depending on how Cameroon, Ivory Coast and hosts Morocco do in the competition.",
      "But United are hoping to delay their stars' exits, and Ruben Amorim wants them at his disposal to face Bournemouth on December 15. The Red Devils have lost the clash 3-0 in each of the last two seasons.",
      "Under AFCON rules, players must be released two weeks prior to their opening match. Morocco play in the first game of the tournament when they face Comoros as hosts on December 21.",
      "Ivory Coast and Cameroon play the first games on December 24. That would mean Amad and Mbeumo should depart no later than following the Wolves game on December 8.",
      "Amorim confirmed last week that talks are underway with international federations regarding flexibility in the matter. \"We have the rules for when we have to release the players, but we are trying to have the players a bit longer,\" the United coach said.",
      "\"It is not just in our hands. We will try to arrange something with the federations.\"",
      "United did not engage in talks until late in the international break but are keen to retain the services of all three players, per Mail Online. United are hoping for assistance after the club's lack of depth was exposed in defeat to Everton.",
      "A decision is yet to be made, according to reports. United have previously had success in such negotiations when they struck a deal with Cameroon so that Andre Onana only missed one game during AFCON two years ago.",
      "Amorim has not ruled out delving into the transfer market to cope with the winter blow to his squad. The Portuguese coach has accepted the negative impacts of doing deals may mean business is not possible.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON],\" he said. \"But we already knew.",
      "\"Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stole the headlines after scoring twice and drawing comparisons to Didier Drogba in Marseille's 2-1 victory over Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "Marseille hosted the Magpies at the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday evening and endured a difficult start as Harvey Barnes gave the visitors a 1-0 lead inside six minutes. But Aubameyang struck twice in quick succession after the break to secure a 2-1 win and earned widespread acclaim from the French media.",
      "Ex-Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood also played a key role in the Ligue 1 side's second-half fightback, and Le Parisien observed that he \"brilliantly found\" Aubameyang in the first 45 minutes, though the team couldn't convert that dominance into goals.",
      "Get Football France awarded the ex-United player a 5/10 rating, but Aubameyang earned 7/10 for his display. Le Figaro highlighted that Greenwood provided some \"perfect crosses\" but suggested the 24-year-old still needs time before becoming the club's main attraction.",
      "Veteran forward Aubameyang, however, drew parallels with former Chelsea legend Drogba, with Le Parisien declaring he \"stole the show.\"",
      "In their match analysis, the French publication said: \"He and Drogba have followed different paths, but share a common thread: they both knew how to ignite the Vélodrome.",
      "\"They are those great African strikers who carry the city, who instinctively understand what this jersey represents, this raw fervor, this simple and magnificent injunction: to go towards the goal, always.",
      "\"Like Drogba in his day, Aubameyang is now one of the providers. In a cauldron of a stadium, he scored more than just a brace: he perpetuated the tradition, he honoured the motto, he held Marseille close to his heart. Straight to the point. Always.\"",
      "French publication Le Figaro were similarly effusive in their praise of the former Arsenal striker, as they added: \"More than 20 years after the OM-Newcastle match in 2004, people in Marseille are still talking about Didier Drogba's exploits in that game.",
      "\"That might not be the case for Aubameyang. But his performance on Tuesday was still invaluable.\"",
      "Marseille weren't the only side to triumph over English opposition on Tuesday evening, with Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen claiming a memorable 2-0 victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Barcelona proved the exception amongst European clubs facing Premier League sides, suffering a harsh 3-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Manchester City have been told that Pep Guardiola leaving the Etihad will be like when Sir Alex Ferguson stood down as United boss. Fergie retired back in 2013 after winning one final Premier League title.",
      "But his departure coincided with a serious decline in United's fortunes. Since Fergie rode into the sunset, United have not been crowned English champions or come remotely close to winning the Champions League.",
      "Guardiola is under contract at the Etihad until 2027 and will complete a decade's service before the start of next season. The Spaniard has said he has no plans to stand down - and could continue in his role until 2035. But club bosses know the Spaniard will call time on his incredible spell in charge at some stage.",
      "And former City defender Danny Mills reckons the impact of him leaving will be similar to when Fergie left United.",
      "\"It’s going to be very difficult to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City,\" Mills told BetWright. \"He’s brought such a unique style of play and coaching, which has been embedded in the club for almost a decade.",
      "\"The owners will have to consider whether they want to maintain that style, or move to a 'win at all costs' mentality, and totally rebrand. Up until a few seasons ago, I would've suggested Mikel Arteta as a potential replacement for Pep, but that obviously won't happen now given what he’s achieved and built at Arsenal.",
      "\"A lot depends on when Guardiola leaves the club, and who is available to replace him. \"I don't think the managerial role will be in high demand - it could be considered as a lose-lose situation for whoever succeeds Pep.",
      "\"When David Moyes replaced Sir Alex Ferguson, he was never going to replicate the success of the past, but the expectation was there.",

      "Chelsea sent shockwaves through Europe on Tuesday night, as they demolished Catalan giants Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. The task of welcoming Barca in the Champions League was always going to be daunting, given the calibre of their team.",
      "This was evident early on when Ferran Torres had a clear shot at goal but astonishingly missed, leaving the crowd in disbelief. Chelsea seized the moment, scoring off a smart corner routine which resulted in a Jules Kounde own-goal, just before Barcelona were reduced to 10-men due to Ronald Araujo receiving his second yellow card before half-time.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side kept up the pressure, with Estevao's superb solo effort doubling their lead after the break. It was further capitalised on when Pedro Neto found room behind the Barca defence, setting up Liam Delap for an easy goal.",
      "Three goals, three points and a resounding message to the rest of Europe that Chelsea mean business summed up a triumphant night for the Blues. Among the standout performers was Estevao, whose dazzling footwork and skills echoed those of many legendary players at Stamford Bridge, thrilling the fans.",
      "Following another stellar performance, the young Brazilian has received heaps of praise, including a comparison from Thierry Henry. Speaking on CBS Sports, the former Arsenal player said of Estevao: \"You wouldn't like to play against him.",
      "\"I'm not saying that you wouldn't be able to stop him, but he's coming at you all the time. He's reminding me of, I know it's early doors, but that's why I think Ryan Giggs was one of the best because he was coming at you for all the game.",
      "\"Whether he's having a good game or not a good game, he's trying to test you all the time and see if you're going to stop him or not. That's how it is as a winger.\"",
      "It's significant praise for the teenager, who's adapted well to the Premier League and Champions League. The 18-year-old officially arrived from Palmeiras during the summer in a transfer worth £29million, which may well prove exceptional value if he maintains his current trajectory.",
      "In only 17 appearances, Estevao has netted five times and provided one assist, while being carefully integrated into the squad by Maresca. Should he achieve anything approaching Giggs' illustrious career, it would represent an outstanding success - the Welsh legend featured in over 900 matches for Manchester United, recording 168 goals and 270 assists.",
      "When questioned after the match about managing Estevao's minutes, and whether it becomes more challenging to limit his game-time given such performances, Maresca replied: \"No, to be honest. Because, for when he doesn't play, Pedro Neto plays wide in his position.",
      "\"And Pedro is good. And we're happy with Pedro. We try just to defend the game plan, we use 11 players. Tonight, we decided, probably in the most difficult game of the season, we decided to play with Estevao.",
      "\"So I'm not a manager that I don't allow players to play minutes. It's just the game-plan. The game-plan always decides the first XI. It's the reason why we changed so much.",
      "\"And you say that we are unpredictable. But it's the game-plan. The game-plan defines the first 11. Now, the next one is Arsenal. The game-plan is not always good, sometimes it's also wrong.",
      "\"It defines the first XI. And Estevao, when the game plan is for him, he's going to play. And for sure he's going to play many games because he's very good.\"",

      "Kai Rooney could finally follow in his dad's footsteps by debuting at Old Trafford next month. The 15-year-old son of Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has been turning heads at academy level, showcasing his skills both as a centre-forward and on the wing.",
      "However, due to his age, he hasn't yet had the chance to play on the hallowed turf of the Theatre of Dreams. This could all change come December, when Darren Fletcher's Under-18s squad face off against Peterborough United in the third round of the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Last season, the team were denied the opportunity to play at Old Trafford in the fifth round of the competition, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos looking to cut costs across the board, according to the Daily Mail. Instead, the match was held at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Rooney is currently nearing the end of his recovery from an injury that has kept him out of action for most of the season. He managed just two appearances this term before suffering the setback in September.",
      "In recent months, he has hinted at a successful recovery and has even returned to training on grass. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be fully fit in time for next month's clash.",
      "Unfortunately, his father, Wayne, may not be able to watch him make his debut at the Stretford End. It has recently emerged that Manchester United and England legend is unable to attend his son's football matches due to his own fame.",
      "During her time on ITV's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! last year, Wayne's wife, Coleen, revealed: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out. Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.'",
      "\"Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite not being able to watch his son compete in person, Wayne has shared that he still plays a significant role in his son's development by offering advice at home. Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show last month, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'We're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'You need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'Watch me hit the ball in the top corner.'\".",
      "Speaking about his son's development, he added: \"He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

Butt responded by relaying an issue with his United season ticket.",

      "Hansi Flick has explained why Marcus Rashford started on the subs bench for Barcelona's Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Tuesday - pointing to Ferran Torres' recent goal-scoring form as a key factor. Rashford had been side-lined through illness for their La Liga triumph over Athletic Club last weekend - which influenced the manager's thinking.",
      "Despite Rashford's absence, Barca cruised to an impressive victory at the Camp Nou - their first at the iconic stadium in several years - netting four goals while keeping their opponents at bay. Torres netted twice in that match, prompting Flick to hand him a starting berth for the European fixture at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Speaking to Mundo Deportivo, Flick explained: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday - and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury. But he's ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "The Barcelona boss proved true to his word at the break, introducing Rashford in place of Torres - who had squandered a golden chance in the opening period - before matters soon deteriorated for the visitors. An unfortunate Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo's dismissal left Barcelona trailing and down to 10 men at half-time.",
      "Rashford found it difficult to make an impact as Chelsea extended their advantage through a spectacular Estevao Willian effort and a composed Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to face harsh criticism for his display in west London, given the difficult circumstances, with Flick remaining a staunch admirer of Rashford - something he made abundantly clear when questioned about his integration into the squad earlier this week.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But, as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I've followed him, I think, his whole career... I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it with Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to make his transfer permanent from United is unlikely to rest with Flick, but 13 goal contributions so far this campaign suggests he's doing everything possible to ensure the £26million buy-option included in his loan deal gets triggered.",
      "Ruben Amorim could desperately use Rashford right now following his side's failure to find the net against 10-man Everton on Monday night.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko were side-lined through injury for that defeat, with the latter facing several weeks out of action. Bryan Mbeumo will also be unavailable over the New Year period as he represents Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "Manchester United have landed Kyle Macaulay as their new head of senior scouting with the 39-year-old previously working as an analyst under Graham Potter.",
      "He's held roles at Brighton, Chelsea and West Ham but will now bolster the department at Old Trafford with his remit centring on their transfer business. Macaulay will oversee United's global scouting network and report into Christopher Vivell, United’s director of recruitment.",
      "The pair will reunite having worked with each other at Chelsea from 2022 to 2023, Vivell was technical director and Macaulay was head of scouting. Macaulay’s career path has largely followed that of Potter - even going back to Swedish side Ostersunds.",
      "Macaulay spent six years as Ostersunds’ chief analyst during their rise and then followed Potter to Swansea City in 2018 as chief scout. At Brighton he was their head of scouting and helped uncover a number of gems, some of whom resulted in huge profits and now play for leading Premier League sides.",
      "Leandro Trossard, Moises Caicedo, Kaoru Mitoma, Marc Cucurella and Danny Welbeck were all signed on Macaulay's watch before he left the Amex to head to Chelsea.",
      "He remained with the Blues after Potter's sacking in a chief analyst role under Mauricio Pochettino and Enzo Maresca. Macaulay left Chelsea to join West Ham alongside Potter in January 2025 but departed in October, shortly after Potter was given his marching orders.",
      "United had been looking to add a key figure to assist on transfers since July, reports The Athletic, and considered a number of candidates before landing on Macaulay. Among those they looked at was Ben Chorley, the former sporting director of Valenciennes in France and current head of UK scouting at Southampton.",
      "Recruitment has long been considered an issue for the Manchester side, but it was generally accepted that they had one of their best windows back in the summer. They invested heavily but bought in players who had proven themselves in England - Bryan Mbeumo among them.",
      "The jury is still out on the £74million they spent on Benjamin Sesko, but Ruben Amorim remains confident the young Slovenian will come good. Senne Lammens was signed as an unknown quantity but the Belgian has established himself as the new United No 1 after some impressive showings.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen giving Jamie Gittens a boost as they strolled down the tunnel of Turf Moor on Saturday. Gittens was included in Enzo Maresca's starting line-up for Chelsea's match against Burnley, replacing the Argentinian forward.",
      "However, instead of throwing a tantrum, the 21-year-old displayed his maturity with a friendly gesture as they headed back onto the pitch after half-time. Garnacho was leading the way when Gittens seemed to call out to him, playfully gesturing towards his eyes as if to say he was keeping an eye on him.",
      "Garnacho responded with a grin and a gesture of his own as they moved out of sight of the television cameras. Even though he didn't get a chance to play from the bench, Garnacho made a beeline for the away end at Turf Moor following Chelsea's 2-0 victory to show his gratitude to the fans who had travelled all the way from London.",
      "Garnacho appears to be hitting his stride on the pitch whilst building solid connections with his new teammates off it. Since his £40million switch from Manchester United this summer, Garnacho has notched two goals and provided two assists across 10 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Meanwhile, Maresca was also quick to heap praise on the youngster earlier this month. He said of Garnacho: \"He arrived here from another club where he was not training 100 per cent so his physical condition was not good.",
      "\"Slowly, slowly, now it's better. He's doing very well on the ball but he's doing very, very well off the ball. He knows that to play with us he has to be good on the ball and off the ball otherwise he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "It's a completely different scenario to how Garnacho was getting on with United earlier this campaign. After being frozen out under Ruben Amorim, Garnacho slammed the club's dismal 15th-place Premier League finish.",
      "He was also frustrated at losing the Europa League final to an equally-struggling Tottenham at the time. He said in May: \"It's difficult for all of us. This season has been s***. We lost the final, we didn't beat anyone in PL. It's very difficult.\"",
      "Manchester United could have done with a bit of Garnacho's magic on Monday night, as they found it tough to break down a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. Despite having an extra man after Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping Michael Keane just 13 minutes in, the Reds couldn't find a way past David Moyes' resurgent side.",
      "The match was stolen by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who netted the decisive goal 29 minutes in, before a Jordan Pickford masterclass denied United of any hopes of levelling. The Red Devils are also feeling the pinch of mid-season injuries, having to rely on Joshua Zirkzee for the full match due to Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko being out injured.",
      "Zirkzee has found it hard to adjust to the Premier League's physicality since his move from Bologna last summer, managing only three goals in England's top tier last season. It'll be intriguing to see how Amorim copes in the coming weeks, especially with Sesko expected to be side-lined until December.",
      "There's no word yet on when Cunha will be back in action, following a knock he picked up in training last week. United's next challenge is Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, 30 November.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been completely unequivocal and unapologetic about the need for change at Manchester United since taking over in February 2024. The petrochemicals billionaire's pursuit of his one true goal has upset many over the past 20 months – including ex-players and club legends.",
      "It has been over a year since Ratcliffe decided to take Sir Alex Ferguson’s lucrative role as club ambassador away from him. Ferguson is just a drop in the ocean, set in the context of more than 450 staff redundancies, but the legendary ex-manager was a big step in terms of perception.",
      "It showed that Ratcliffe and his Ineos operation were not worried about negative PR. He is dead set on making savings wherever they can be found – and the most recent financial results showed the direction of travel in that respect, with record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m.",
      "Ineos have employed consultants to make recommendations, and while they likely led to redundancies, the moving of London office eight years early and reduction of staff benefits and freebies, they are unlikely to have had anything to do with the chipping away of relationships with the club’s past.",
      "It is something ex-manager David Moyes hinted at ahead of Everton’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Monday. “The history of Manchester United was not that [one of change],” he said.",
      "“Manchester United had a great culture. They stuck with their managers, they brought through their own academy boys. They actually had some of the best characteristics of what you would want your club to have; good values.”",
      "While Moyes was addressing issues on the pitch, there is an obvious parallel happening off it, where the culture has undoubtedly changed. Much has been made of the improvements to the club’s Carrington training ground, but there have also been hints at United moving away from its roots in another sense.",
      "Club legend Norman Whiteside decided not to renew his season ticket in May after a series of issues, including the relocation of his seat, while Ferguson had to step in last year to ensure the family of Sir Matt Busby kept their seats.",
      "The price of tickets has increased and modern club legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are struggling to get hold of them. Scholes revealed on Monday that he had turned to a tout to get tickets, while Butt said he had been threatened with losing his season ticket after missing a few games.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.” Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.”",
      "Taken separately these incidents perhaps don’t add up to much, but seen together they paint a picture of the club Ineos are trying to create: a modern, efficient, money-making one. A connection to the club’s extremely successful past doesn’t fit into that picture.",
      "It seems that manager Ruben Amorim might have a sense of this becoming an issue. He reportedly wants to bring back legends like Eric Cantona in order to maintain a connection to the past and to share experiences. But with United sitting 10th in the Premier League after they failed to score past 10-man Everton for 81 minutes, he undoubtedly has bigger priorities for now.",
      "Amorim is far from certain to get his way and, as the manager of a struggling team, he could be discarded soon anyway. Ratcliffe and Ineos have shown they are 100 per cent focused on the future and have disregarded the importance of the past.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Scholes is one of United’s greatest ever players, but he claims that so much has changed at the club since he retired that he wouldn’t know who to contact to source legitimate tickets.",
      "The midfielder made 718 appearances for United after coming through the academy. He helped the club win 25 major trophies, including 11 Premier League titles during an era of dominance under Sir Alex Ferguson, but he feels disconnected from the current era.",
      "Scholes discussed the situation with his former United team-mate Nicky Butt on The Good, the Bad & the Football podcast. Butt was also a part of the famous Class of 92 group of players, which also included the Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, and has similar feelings and experiences.",
      "“It's a very different football club to the club we knew,” Scholes said. “I don't know about you Nicky, you worked there quite recently, but I don't really know anybody there.”",
      "Butt replied: “I don't know anybody there.” Scholes then said: “If I wanted a ticket, I wouldn’t know who to phone. I’ve been asked for a couple of tickets but didn’t know where to go.",
      "“I have four season tickets so we use them, my son uses them every single week. But you get people asking (for tickets). I've had a Salford lad who wants to go to the game this week, a couple of tickets. So I've had to ring a tout. Am I allowed to say that? Honestly, I know a tout. I just don’t know anybody at the club!”",
      "Butt then relayed a story in which he claims United threatened to take a season ticket away from him because it hadn’t been used frequently enough. “My lad has got the same thing, and if you don't use them three times you get them taken off you,” he said.",
      "“I've had an email saying ‘you're having your ticket taken off you’. So I rang them up and said ‘can I speak to somebody about this please?’ And it’s just a switchboard, so they might not be a football fan, and they go ‘who am I speaking to please?’, and I go ‘Nicky Butt’ and they go, ‘OK, well who's that?’ I didn’t say it but I feel like saying ‘I played like 450 games for this club and I won about seven titles’ but it is a different world. I wouldn’t know where to go.”",
      "“I'm not complaining about that,” he said. “That's just the way it is and the way it happens. Just because you played for the club, you're not entitled to stuff.”",
      "An exasperated Paddy McGuinness responded: “Hang on a minute! The amount of games you played, your life long service as a player for United, you gave everything to the club.”",
      "Scholes replied: “Yeah but we only played for them. You're going back 13 years now for the last time I played. We don't mind paying for them, we just don't know who to ring because the club is just different, it's a different football club.”",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have lifted the lid on a secret meeting where they were asked to weigh in on potential signings for the club. The former midfield maestros revealed the consultation took place while Ryan Giggs was serving as caretaker boss during the 2013/14 campaign following the departure of David Moyes.",
      "The Red Devils were in the midst of a major overhaul following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, with the club pursuing high-profile acquisitions in an effort to reclaim their position among the Premier League's elite. Against this backdrop, then-executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward turned to Scholes and Butt for their input, presenting the duo with a shortlist of four potential recruits.",
      "During an appearance on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, the United stalwarts detailed how that discussion with Woodward ultimately paved the way for Paul Pogba's homecoming. Butt recalled: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season...",
      "\"Then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well. And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like, 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think [Cesc] Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even [Luka] Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was, 'go for both of them, [Toni] Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United brought Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, sealing a transfer from Juventus that could have totalled £93million with all the additional clauses. The France international featured 233 times for the Red Devils during his second spell, netting 39 goals and providing 51 assists.",
      "He then left on a free transfer in 2022. Pogba's career is often viewed through different lenses, with some recalling the magic he could weave, while others feel he never consistently lived up to his hefty price tag.",
      "The inclusion of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas in the team might have altered his fate, with the first two continuing to shine at Real Madrid for many more years, while the latter had a stint back in England with Chelsea, before playing in France and then Italy.",

      "Manchester United have been encouraged to pursue a deal for Jean-Philippe Mateta, with Bacary Sagna claiming a move for the Crystal Palace striker makes perfect sense.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with the Frenchman back in the summer before signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for big money. But despite spending over £200million in the summer on an overhaul of their attack - and some promising early signs from the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - United are still being linked with another striker.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Ruben Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy would like another out and out No 9 to compete with Sesko, whispers of interest in Mateta refuse to go away.",
      "And Sagna feels that moving for Mateta, a proven goalscorer at Premier League level, would be a no-brainer as Crystal Palace struggle to tie their talisman down to a new deal.",
      "“It would make sense if Jean-Philippe Mateta went to Manchester United,” the former Arsenal defender told Oddspedia. “They don’t really have a No 9 who is tall, can hold the ball and can get on the end of crosses.",
      "“It could be difficult for him as a new player coming into a club where there are a lot of new players and transferring his skills across from Crystal Palace, but a move to Old Trafford would be good for him and the club.",
      "“It will also be difficult for Palace to keep hold of him, and it’s the right moment for him to move if he wants the test of playing for one of the biggest teams in the Premier League. He’s not a young player anymore and it might be one of the last moves of his career, so he will probably push for it if the opportunity arises.”",
      "Sagna's comments come less than 24 hours after it emerged talks between Mateta and Crystal Palace over a new contract are at a standstill.",
      "The Standard have confirmed that Palace will need to 'significantly increase' their current offer if they are to persuade Mateta to stay at Selhurst Park, with the striker - whose current deal expires in 2027 - dreaming of a move to an elite club.",

      "Jordan Pickford has revealed how a blunt message from David Moyes inspired Everton's famous win at Old Trafford. The Toffees are celebrating becoming the first team in Premier League history to triumph at Manchester United after going down to 10 men.",
      "Despite Idrissa Gueye getting sent off inside 14 minutes, the visitors triumphed thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunning strike. And it was Moyes's first win at Old Trafford as a visiting boss in 18 attempts.",
      "But Pickford reckons Moyes should thanks himself for the stunning result - after telling his players before kick off how Everton needed to win at United to be considered a \"proper team\".",
      "Pickford said: \"The manager said before the game, 'you want to be a proper team, you want to push up the table, tonight's the time to go and stamp your authority on it and get a result'. We know it's not as easy as that, but we gave what the gaffer wanted and we got our rewards.",
      "\"It's a great win, great performance. Some good football as well, but suffering at times as a team. If you’re suffering the right way, you get results.",
      "\"Football's weird because Manchester United are in form at the minute. If they had won they would have been top four - and everyone's talking about them.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves, and we've got to put our performance on and not focus on how well United are doing, because once we put our performance in and our shift we can get results.\"",
      "Pickford acted as the peacemaker, after Gueye had slapped team-mate Michael Keane in the face to get his marching orders.",
      "And when asked what happened, Pickford added: \"Initially I didn't see what happened, \"I just saw them arguing. But the main thing is that Idrissa come in and apologised.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has received a less-than-glowing assessment from Michael Owen after his performance against Everton. Zirkzee was handed his first start of the Premier League season by Manchester United on Monday but it did not go to plan for the Dutch striker or his side in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Zirkzee has been stuck on the substitutes’ bench this season, with Ruben Amorim preferring to start summer signings Matheus Cunha or Benjamin Sesko up front. But with Sesko out injured and Cunha pulling out last-minute due to a knock in training, Amorim had little option but to trust Zirkzee against Everton.",
      "The Toffees were reduced to 10 men after just 13 minutes when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for slapping his team-mate Michael Keane. But United couldn’t take advantage, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s goal earning the away side all three points as Everton repelled pressure.",
      "United dominated the ball and had 25 shots, but couldn’t find a way past Jordan Pickford, who made an impressive late save to keep out Zirkzee’s header. The 24-year-old is yet to score or assist in six appearances this season and Owen has suggested he doesn’t have a future at the club.",
      "“I can’t watch him and get excited, I must admit,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Cunha missing today was a big blow. He was the closest to scoring for Man United but they are almost resorting to playing like this with hopeful crosses because he’s in there.",
      "“If you have Cunha playing, a different profile of player, you probably don’t go knocking crosses in all game. It’s not how Manchester United want to play and I always think if you start lumping the ball it becomes desperation.",
      "“One or two landed on Zirkzee’s head but the way Man United are playing prior to tonight, it’s not the right profile of player, he doesn’t excite me at all.”",
      "Zirkzee joined United for £36million from Bologna in July 2024. He has managed just seven goals and three assists in 55 appearances for the club since then and has been strongly linked with a move away from Old Trafford in 2026.",
      "The arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for over £200m in the summer has seen Zirkzee relegated in the pecking order, with United’s exit at the hands of Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and their lack of European football giving him even fewer opportunities to play.",
      "However, with Sesko currently injured after being forced off in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham earlier this month and Mbeumo heading to the Africa Cup of Nations next month along with Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo, Amorim may have to deny Zirkzee a move away in the January transfer window and use him more often.",
      "United are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday when they will be hoping to have Cunha back. Amorim’s side are 10th in the Premier League after Everton ended their five-game unbeaten streak in the league.",

      "There are few more precarious jobs than that of a football manager. Four Premier League bosses have already been sacked this season as clubs seek to turn around their fortunes.",
      "Vitor Pereira, Graham Potter, Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou have all been given their marching orders during the campaign. Santo is already back in this division, providing a very vivid illustration of the managerial merry-go-round.",
      "With just 12 games played this season, it's not unthinkable that more coaches could find themselves on the chopping block before the end of 2025/26. More than one may already have a bead of sweat on their brow in concern over the position.",
      "A lucky or qualified few will not have thought about the prospect of being sacked and have zero fear of their futures being pulled out from underneath them. Things change quickly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal are flying high at the top of the Premier League, and the Gunners wouldn't dream of sacking Mikel Arteta as he looks on course to finally bring a title to the Emirates. Missing out again could leave food for thought, but the Spaniard is overseeing an impressive job in north London.",
      "Pep Guardiola is a figure likely to decide his own future at Manchester City, while Oliver Glasner is on course for another strong season after leading Crystal Palace to the FA Cup last term. The latter is much more likely to depart of his own accord.",
      "After an uncertain start, Unai Emery has guided Aston Villa into fourth, while Chelsea won't be quick to part ways with Enzo Maresca, with the club in second in the Premier League.",
      "Bournemouth ’s Andoni Iraola is working wonders after a summer of sales and Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris is enjoying an exciting season with newly-promoted Sunderland. No danger of the sack there.",
      "Likewise, Fabian Hurzeler is guiding Brighton well with the Seagulls just four points from Chelsea in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Sean Dyche's win over Liverpool will see him in good standing as Nottingham Forest 's third boss of the season.",
      "Eddie Howe is in no danger of being sacked despite the club sitting 14th. If that's where they stay, questions could be asked of his ability to manage domestic and Champions League football come the end of the season.",
      "Scott Parker and David Moyes remain good fits for Burnley and Everton respectively, and shouldn't be looking over their shoulder other than after any devastating form which dramatically pushes their teams to relegation. Likewise, Keith Andrews has enjoyed a good start at Brentford, but in his first role in the top job needs to continue to prove himself.",
      "Fulham want to tie Marco Silva down to a new deal before the end of the year, but the Portuguese coach has yet to commit. The Cottagers' season has not been a roaring success, and it will be interesting to see what transpires if that continues.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo appears to have found his feet at West Ham, while Rob Edwards has barely had time to sit down at Wolves. Both will know their employers can be ruthless.",
      "Arne Slot is not on the verge of being sacked after winning the league last year, but is undoubtedly under a degree of pressure after six defeats in seven Premier League outings. The Dutchman is shouldering the blame for Liverpool's dramatic fall in form.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank has helped Spurs to a position much higher than last year's 17th position. Defeat to Arsenal and some subpar performances have not borne much in the way of affection from fans, but club owners, the Lewis family, are clear on Frank’s appointment being part of a long-term project.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim needs to deliver this season, with no European football. The Portuguese coach will be expected to return the Red Devils to a truly competitive team and they are still producing performances of varying quality.",
      "Daniel Farke remains the bookies' favourite for the sack. The Leeds boss saw speculation over his future in the summer, having never kept a team in the Premier League. Three defeats in a row leaves the Yorkshire club in the relegation zone.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Owen once spent a fortune on a street of new houses for his family after kickstarting his professional football career. Born in Chester and raised in nearby Hawarden, Owen broke through the ranks of the Liverpool academy in 1996 before enjoying an emphatic eight-year tenure at Anfield.",
      "And thanks to his success early on, the now 45-year-old was in a financial position to splash the cash on new houses for his family in the area he grew up. Owen, speaking to Reece Mennie on his podcast, said: \"I bought a lot of houses right at the outset when I first came into a bit of money for my family.",
      "\"So it was all news at the time, but I bought a street of new houses, which I bought when I was about 19. 26 years later, my mum and dad live in the first one, my brother in the next one, my brother in the next one, my sister in the next one. So we've got a full street in the village that we were brought up in, which was lovely to do.\"",
      "As per a report from The Guardian back in 2001, Owen spent around £750,000 to home his nearest and dearest alongside one another - roughly three months' wages at the time. However, it is said that Owen didn't take up tenure at a property on the street himself, instead, opting to settle a mile down the road in a detached house.",
      "Just the fourth Englishman to win the Ballon d'Or, Owen enjoyed an incredible career with Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, racking up 158 goals and 51 assists across 297 appearances. With the Reds, he also won an FA Cup, a pair of League Cups, a Community Shield, a UEFA Cup and a UEFA Super Cup before making the move to Real Madrid in an £8million deal.",
      "However, his time at the Bernabeu was less than fruitful, making 45 appearances over the course of a year before returning to English soil to play for Newcastle United. After spending four years at St James' Park, Owen transferred to Liverpool's bitter rivals, Manchester United.",
      "There, he won the Premier League in 2009/10, as well as adding another League Cup and Community Shield to his trophy cabinet. After spending three years with the Red Devils, Owen signed for Stoke City in 2012, lasting just one season with the Potters before hanging up his boots.",
      "Owen also achieved 89 caps for England on the world stage as part of the nation's 'Golden Generation', but ultimately failed to win a major honour with the Three Lions. It comes as Owen was spotted in unrecognisable fashion at his daughter's birthday bash earlier this month.",
      "The former forward donned Hulk Hogan fancy dress attire as he celebrated his youngest daughter's 18th, wearing a one-piece costume with inflated muscles which read 'Hulkamania' across the chest. He also wore an over-the-top fake moustache, a blonde wig and a bandana to tie the piece together.",
      "Also spotted at the do was his eldest daughter and former Love Island star, Gemma, who opted to dress as a flapper girl in a stunning metallic dress, complete with long black satin gloves, a pearl necklace and a rhinestone headband.",
      "Owen's wife, Louise, meanwhile, sported a look of Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany's. She wore an elegant black dress with long black gloves and dark sunglasses.",
      "The couple's son, James, was dressed as a jockey, while birthday girl Emily stole the show in a Marylin Monroe costume.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The defender added: \"We conceded one goal AND we didn't create a lot of chances. I think overall it was just a really bad performance.",

      "\"That’s the difference between winning and losing, the efficiency. We lacked that. I think we lacked maybe the urgency to score the goals, to create the chances, and then you know, against a team like Everton, who drops back and who are really strong in the air, it's going to be quite difficult. That basically sums up the night.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has rejected the idea that he is \"fixated\" with his tactics at Manchester United, while confirming that he is \"willing\" to tweak the team's approach to win games. Amorim has steadfastly stood by his 3-4-3 formation since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon, saying that not even the Pope could persuade him to change United's tactical system.",
      "The formation has been contentious, but Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month in October after overseeing wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which silenced speculation about his future. United have started November with two draws and a defeat to Everton, who claimed three points at Old Trafford, despite playing for 77 minutes with just 10 men due to a sending off.",
      "Amorim was accused of being stubborn against Everton, but he has insisted he is adaptable. DAZN Portugal has launched a new Q&A segment on YouTube, where fans have the opportunity to ask questions to the \"biggest Portuguese figures in world football\", and Amorim was the first guest.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would return to he \"mobile attacking style\" he implemented at Sporting, where there was no fixed striker and the front line would constantly rotate. Although Viktor Gyokeres was the first choice striker during Amorim's time at Sporting, the shape was built around rotations, with Gyokeres asked to drift wide, link play and drop deep.",
      "The 40-year-old said United have already played with a fluid attack this season and, interestingly, said that he was \"willing\" to try new tactics, despite critics thinking he is \"fixated.\"",
      "Amorim said: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing.",
      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim has regularly insisted his system is not a problem. Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"The problem of our team is not the system. We have a lot of problems, we are trying to work on these problems, of course every system needs different characteristics. But I was always really clear. I have one idea.",
      "\"I am still really confident because I have an idea how to play football. I will not change that, no matter what. And I’m not talking about the system, it’s the way I see football, I will not change that.\"",

      "Although Manchester United have tended to struggle without Casemiro on the pitch this season, Ruben Amorim was happy to hook him before the hour mark against Everton on Monday. Casemiro started poorly and didn't make a single tackle during his 58-minute appearance.",
      "He looked like a 33-year-old, and the display was a reminder of why he shouldn't be given a contract extension. The fact that there has even been a conversation about whether Casemiro merits an extension (his current deal expires in June) is a credit to himself, but it would be a mistake to keep him beyond this season.",
      "It's been great to see Casemiro make such a strong start to the campaign, but there were always doubts about how long he could sustain that level. After all, he has entered the winter of his career so it seemed unlikely he would be able to perform like that for the entire season.",
      "Casemiro's performance against Everton was the kind of display expected from someone of his age. He looked pedestrian and struggled with Everton's physicality before the red card. There are bound to be more performances like that from Casemiro before the end of the campaign. And of course, there should be some more strong displays produced as well, but the point is that United need someone in that position who can deliver every week. They need someone younger.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday in February, and he is the highest earner in the dressing room, so United would make an Ed Woodward-esque decision by extending his deal. Those who have argued for Casemiro's contract to be extended have said he should be kept on reduced terms and given a back-up role, but this is a player who has won five Champions League trophies.",
      "It seems unlikely Casemiro would accept a huge pay cut to sit on the bench in Manchester when the option of playing in his homeland - and still starting each game - could be on the table. Regardless, the option should be taken out of his hands. United need to move on and sign a replacement.",
      "There was another contract lesson to be taken from the performance against Everton because Harry Maguire's absence was felt at the back. Thierno Barry won 14 aerial duels, the most by a player in a Premier League game this season, which wouldn't have happened with Maguire on the pitch.",
      "Leny Yoro is an exciting prospect for the future, but he lacked aggression in several instances against Everton, and Maguire would have been the better choice had he been available.",
      "Everton are a physical side and dominated aerial duels. United are guaranteed to be dragged into battles like that on a few occasions across a season, and Maguire is indispensable in those scenarios.",
      "Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, but it's logical for United to try to extend his stay at Old Trafford, provided he is happy to take a slight pay cut to continue at the club.",
      "The England international does not earn as much as Casemiro, which should make it easier for a compromise to be reached between both parties, while his role in the squad wouldn't change much.",
      "Set-pieces have become important again in the Premier League over the last two seasons and losing Maguire, who is more often than not imperious in the air, would be a huge blow.",
      "Amorim recently said about Maguire's future: \"We are really happy with Harry. It is not the time to talk about that again because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away. We are really happy with Harry. He is a really important for us, but we need to focus on the next game.\"",
      "The United boss was asked whether he was pleased with Maguire's renaissance and said: \"Yes. I think it was good for him to play with the three centre-backs. I think he feels more comfortable.",
      "\"He doesn't need to go to the side so much. Sometimes, you help some players with the way you play. Sometimes, it is the opposite with some players. I am really pleased. I think he is not young, but he can learn a lot. He can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball because he has that quality.",
      "\"He needs to show that. Nowadays, with the set-pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box, every cross from the opponent, everyone is playing the pass.\"",
      "Maguire's stock rose without him playing against Everton, while Casemiro's didn't do himself any favours.",

      "Hundreds of Manchester United fans were left fuming ahead of the side's clash with Everton last night (November 24) after facing huge delays entering Old Trafford. Questions are now being raised over the stewarding of the turnstiles at the ground.",
      "Some supporters have revealed they missed the start of the Premier League game against the Toffees. It is understood delays were partly caused by the length of searches conducted by stewards, as well as a shift to NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to gain entry to the stadium.",
      "There were widespread reports of issues with fans entering the Stretford End.",
      "\"United need to do better for their fans. It has been like this all season when trying to get into the Stretford End and all around Old Trafford,\" a fan posted on social media. Another supporter described the delay as a \"s******.\"",
      "Season ticket holder Graham Barton has complained to United about the length of the queues in the past, but he believed Monday's delay was the worst he has encountered.",
      "\"That has slowed it down a little bit, but the problem is, I'm W11, you have four turnstiles, and there are barriers dividing you up as you queue up. And you've got six stewards searching, and they're usually quite slow. That makes a massive queue, and by the time the queue gets to the wall, the chief steward tells them to search quicker, so the searches aren't adequate anyway, and there's a massive queue.\"",
      "Barton continued: \"It's a safety risk because you don't need anything to get to that point. When I got there, it was the longest the queue had ever been, it went right back to the wall. It was about 20ft along the wall. I took the photos when I got there and spoke to one of the top stewards about it.",
      "\"I didn't like his attitude. He said it wasn't a problem, and I said I'm not comfortable standing in the queue. Think of the Manchester bombing. What if someone wanted to blow someone up here? There were hundreds of people. Then he said it's the turnstiles being slow, not the search time.",
      "\"I have complained about the length of the queues before to the stewards, also when the club sent one of the surveys to season ticket holders, I put down that queuing was an issue.\"",
      "The MEN contacted United for a response to supporter concerns about turnstile delays. A Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration of fans caught in queues close to kick-off and we are constantly looking for ways to improve flows, including deploying additional stewarding staff to help deal with any issues causing hold-ups at turnstiles.",
      "\"However, in general, digital ticketing has been working well and there were no systemic problems reported last night. The best way to avoid queues is to arrive at the stadium in plenty of time before kick-off, although we do appreciate that this can be more difficult for midweek games, and that many fans were affected by traffic congestion around the ground last night.\"",
      "United were also criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the season's opening fixture against Arsenal. The club rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "The MEN were told some stewards on the turnstiles sent fans to the ticketing office because they did not know the solution to the problem, forcing fans to miss the start of the game.",
      "One fan described the Arsenal delays as a \"disgrace\" while another supporter revealed their 77-year-old mother, a platinum season ticket holder, missed the game due to the changes.",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as their new head of senior scouting, following a four-month search to recruit an employee for the position as part of the club's transfer strategy overhaul. Macaulay will oversee the senior scouts and report back to Christopher Vivell, who joined United on a temporary basis last year and was appointed permanently as the director of recruitment in February.",
      "Vivell oversees the club's recruitment network and reports to the director of football, Jason Wilcox. Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, with the former serving as technical director at Stamford Bridge and the latter worked as head of scouting.",
      "In the summer, club sources said the search for a new head of senior scouting was part of the ongoing restructuring and modernisation of the scouting network at Old Trafford. Vivell has streamlined the scouting network but has retained 'significant human scouting and analytical capabilities', particularly focused on emerging talent, with data support.",
      "Macaulay was available to move to Manchester after leaving West Ham in October. He has followed Graham Potter throughout his career, previously working at Swedish club Ostersunds, Swansea City and Brighton, before following Potter to Chelsea and, more recently, West Ham. He spent six years as Ostersunds’ chief analyst, where he first worked with Potter.",
      "Macaulay worked as chief scout for Swansea and served as Brighton's head of scouting during a period in which the Seagulls used their data model to sign Moises Caicedo, Kaoru Mitoma, Marc Cucurella and Leandro Trossard. Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe.",
      "Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has invested in United's data department, notably hiring Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer.

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "Here, we will be covering all of the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip relating to United, as and when it comes in.",
      "The Reds suffered a narrow 1-0 loss to a ten-man Everton on Monday to bring an end to a five-game Premier League unbeaten streak. However, Ruben Amorim will hope to bounce back to winning ways when United take to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace this weekend.",
      "At the time of writing, United sit tenth in the Premier League standings, but could break their way into the top four after their clash with the Eagles, dependent on results elsewhere - something that will come as a major boost as they look to secure European football for 2026/27.",
      "However, Amorim will be well aware that he is set to temporarily lose a number of key players when the Africa Cup of Nations rolls around next month, with Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad all heading to the tournament to represent their respective countries. As a result, Sir Jim Ratcliffe may be called upon for assistance in the January transfer window.",
      "Roma right-back Zeki Celik, Real Madrid stalwart Vinicius Jr and Wolves midfield maestro Joao Gomes are among the latest names to be linked with a move to Old Trafford when the window reopens, as United look to strengthen their team across the board.",
      "On the flipside, Casemiro's contract is set to expire next summer, Marcus Rashford is still out on a season-long loan with Barcelona - who hold an option to make the move permanent in 2026 - and Kobbie Mainoo's future with the club remains uncertain.",
      "With all that considered, the MEN brings you all of the latest United news and transfer rumours...",
      "Manchester United handed Ayden Heaven the opportunity to start for the Under-21s against Solihull Moors on Tuesday, following his inclusion in the first-team squad against Everton. Heaven's only senior start of the season came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round. He lasted 64 minutes at Blundell Park before being replaced by Mason Mount.",
      "The defender has made two appearances from the bench in the Premier League against Fulham and Brighton this term, so the decision was made for Heaven to get minutes into his legs with the U21s. Heaven produced a goal-line clearance at the start of the game. He played 66 minutes and the U21s suffered a 4-1 defeat, which confirmed their exit from the National League Cup with a match to play.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Heaven leaves on loan in the January transfer window. The 19-year-old is seen as a first-team player, but he has made just three senior appearances this season. Heaven was signed from Arsenal for around £1million in the last January window and he received praise from Ruben Amorim on the final day of the Premier League campaign.",
      "While Manchester United are aiming to get back into European contention for next season, the team have plenty of free midweeks this campaign to get themselves geared up for their domestic challenges. There is much to keep track of on the continental stage for Ruben Amorim, however, including the development of Rasmus Hojlund during his loan at Napoli.",
      "The striker struggled to convince the United head coach that he could be part of his plans moving forward, with the arrival of Benjamin Sesko reducing the game time available to him. The Danish international then decided to make a return to Serie A, where he was hoping to recapture the type of form he had shown at Atalanta just a few years before his move to Old Trafford.",
      "Hojlund had certainly managed that early on, finding the back of the net four times across all competitions, with two of those coming in the Champions League, but there have been struggles in recent weeks. He could've broken that difficult run in midweek when Napoli took on Qarabag in another huge European tie, as the on-loan Man United forward was given a chance to give his side the lead from the penalty spot.",
      "It wasn't to be, however, as the forward's effort was too central, and goalkeeper Mateusz Kochalski managed to palm the effort away to keep the scores level. It comes as quite a blow to Hojlund, but fortunately, former Man United star Scott McTominay came to the rescue in some fine fashion.",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens believes it was the right decision to delay his debut for the Reds as he was allowed time to adjust to the pace of the Premier League. After Andre Onana's unconvincing performance at Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Ruben Amorim chose to sign a new goalkeeper before the summer transfer window closed.",
      "Lammens was bought after just one full season at Royal Antwerp and while he arrived in Manchester as an unknown quantity, there was a clamour for him to come straight in to the team. While Onana's exit was almost assured, his replacement Altay Bayindir was also struggling.",
      "Bayindir stayed in goal for matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Brentford before Lammens was given his chance. Speaking on the latest episode of Inside Carrington, the Belgian explained why he felt the decision was made and why he backed it.",
      "Joao Gomes has been strongly linked with Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window. The Brazilian midfielder has emerged as a potential option to strenghten Ruben Amorim's squad, having impressed during his time in the Premier League.",
      "Gomes, meanwhile, is seen as the ideal replacement with Premier League experience. Signed by Wolves from Flamengo in a £16million deal in 2023, the 24-year-old has made 93 Premier League appearances, complemented by six goals and two assists.",
      "He has been a standout player in a poor Wolves side this term, and this may be the only chance for the club to secure a significant fee for Gomes if they are relegated at the end of the campaign. Gomes still has four-and-a-half years left on his contract at Molineux.",
      "Before the Everton defeat, Amorim addressed the futures of Zirkzee and Mainoo and his verdict was clear. Players will only be leaving Old Trafford if it is deemed to be in the club's interest. Amorim clearly has sympathy for both men and the lack of fixtures this season has not helped either man. In terms of Mainoo, there is no desire to see him leave and the midfielder has been doing everything to earn a spot back in the team.",
      "But, MEN Sport reported at the beginning of the year that talks were not progressing. Allowing him to leave in January is unlikely as things stand but United may have to consider this carefully in the summer if no further progress on his contract is made.",
      "After all the money invested in this area of the pitch in the summer, it may be disheartening to mention that attack will need to be looked at closely in January. Zirkzee struggled in the defeat to Everton and it was further proof he cannot play as a No.9. With that in mind, why not take a punt on selling him and replacing him with someone who could provide competition for Sesko. Whoever they target will be relatively inexpensive due to the money already spent but if they could get him for a good fee, Mateta would be a nice option to have.",
      "There has been no progress on a new contract for Kobbie Mainoo for quite a long time, according to David Ornstein.",
      "After prefacing his comments by explaining that nothing is set in stone and there is still a way to go for the January transfer window, Ornstein told NBC this week: “Kobbie Mainoo is a fascinating one. There’s been no progress on talks over a new contract that expires in 2027. There’s an option to extend it by a year, there’s not really been talks for quite a long time.",
      "“He’s on a low salary, which means Manchester United will be comfortable because it’s not exactly a financial burden, but clubs looking at him might see that as an attractive proposition as well. He wanted to go in the summer on loan, as I revealed at the time. Ruben Amorim says he wants him to stay and fight for a place. I guess he would say that.”",
      "Ornstein also explained how United will need to secure a replacement for Mainoo before he is able to leave, which will prove more expensive than keeping the star on their books.",
      "Former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna believes Jean-Philippe Mateta is due a big move and could push for transfer, suggesting Manchester United would be the ideal destination given their lack of a recognised No.9. United have scored 19 goals in the Premier League, just five fewer than leaders Arsenal, but Benjamin Sesko has only struck twice in the league.",
      "While they have won three straight against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, they have recently drawn to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and lost to Everton on Monday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side continue to struggle for consistency, while summer signing Sesko has yet to find his rhythm following his £73million move from RB Leipzig. Sagna believes Mateta could be the ideal answer for their attack.",
      "While it was recently reported that Manchester United were looking at RB Leipzig’s Assan Ouedraogo, it is suggested that the club are now paying attention to Castello Lukeba. The 22-year-old Frenchman has impressed in the Bundesliga after making the move from Lyon in 2023, and a move could be facilitated by his reported release clause.",
      "Chelsea, Real Madrid and Liverpool have also been linked with the star.",
      "As per TEAMtalk, Jean-Philippe Mateta’s negotiations with Crystal Palace have stalled as a result of salary demands, which could open the door for Manchester United to make a swoop in January.",
      "The striker has thrived at Selhurst Park thus far, but with his contract expiring at the end of 2026/27, the Eagles may opt to move him on instead of running the risk of losing him on a free transfer; a situation they find themselves in with skipper Marc Guehi, who sees his own deal in the capital run down next summer.",
      "Louis Saha would like to see Harry Kane return to the Premier League to chase Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record, albeit in the red of Manchester United rather than the white of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Speaking to PunditArena.com, Saha said: \"Harry Kane has earned his position to be the target for Europe’s biggest club, and that’s the best position for him to be in. He would be welcome at any club in the world.",
      "\"He’s a goal scorer, a good guy, a legend and also a leader. He represents football really well, and he is respected by everyone in the game. I really like that. It’s great to see, and he has earned the position he is in, where everyone would want him. I would love him to be at Manchester United of course, and I thought that would be the best move for his career.",
      "\"He’s done it for Bayern Munich, he’s won the league and may win it again. Stats wise, he’s incredible, but at United, he could get Alan Shearer’s record and maybe even add more trophies to his CV. It would be perfect. Harry, forget about Barcelona and Real Madrid, come to Manchester!\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing the possibility of signing James Garner from Everton, a player who was instrumental in the Toffees’ 1-0 win over the Reds on Monday.",
      "The midfielder’s current contract on Merseyside is set to expire come season’s end, with the likes of United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa said to be keeping tabs on his situation. However, sources have told talkSPORT that David Moyes doesn’t want to lose Garner.",
      "Following Manchester United’s 1-0 loss to Everton on Monday, Joshua Zirkzee could well be on the move in January. The Dutchman has struggled to adapt to the Premier League since making the move to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer.",
      "For context, he managed just three goal in the English top flight last term. And with an uninspired performance against the Toffees earlier this week, in which he hardly looked like finding the back of the net, his future with the Reds has been cast into further speculation.",
      "As per Gazzetta, United could look to loan Zirkzee to Roma in January with an option for the Serie A giants to buy him. The publication also claims that Zirkzee is not opposed to a return to Italian soil.",
      "It was recently revealed that Antoine Semenyo's new five-year deal with Bournemouth holds a release clause in the region of £60million, as United continue to monitor the forward's situation having been linked with him over the summer.",
      "However, it is now claimed that Manchester City are interested in the Ghanaian, who was hailed as 'an extraordinary player' by Pep Guardiola earlier this month. It is thought that the Spaniard also has concerns with a lack of goals from his midfield, meaning he could chase Semenyo's signature when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are also said to be interested in the 25-year-old.",
      "As per a Globo report, Manchester United should 'intensify' talks with Wolves to sign Joao Gomes by the end of the year. The club are thought to have shown an interest in the midfielder, with negotiations ongoing to broker a deal for around £43million.",
      "Stay tuned as we bring you all of the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip relating to Manchester United."

      "\"I feel afraid of returning the feeling of last season,\" said Ruben Amorim during his press conference after Manchester United's shocking defeat to Everton on Monday night. It was a warning from Amorim that no supporter wanted to hear, but the performance was reminiscent of last season, raising a few worrying questions ahead of the winter schedule.",
      "Although United won 2-1 against Manchester City last December, the month was otherwise bleak for Amorim. United crashed out of the Carabao Cup against Tottenham, were hammered 3-0 by Bournemouth at Old Trafford, lost against Wolves on Boxing Day and were beaten by Newcastle before New Year's Eve.",
      "Next month must be different. United cannot return to the \"feeling\" of last season, but Amorim could seriously do without losing two of his best players to the Africa Cup of Nations. AFCON will take place between December 21 and January 18. Bryan Mbeumo will represent Cameroon at the tournament, while Amad will feature for the Ivory Coast. Noussair Mazraoui will also be there representing hosts Morocco.",
      "Amorim has admitted United will \"struggle a little bit\" when they lose the trio, but explained during his press conference on Friday that talks will take place with the players' federations to keep them for as long as possible. \"I think it’s going to be more or less at the same time,\" said Amorim when asked whether Benjamin Sesko would return from his injury before United lose players to the AFCON.",
      "\"I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [to prepare for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back. We have the rules about when to release the players. We’ll see, we’re doing our job to keep the players a little longer. But it's not just in our hands, and we have to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and the national team.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify when the rules stated United would have to release the players, and said: \"I think it's two weeks before the start, so we'll try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "The United boss was also asked whether the Wolves fixture on December 8 was an opportunity for other players to impress. \"Yeah, but we already knew [about players leaving], so it is a chance for other players. We need to also send a message. It is not ideal, they are so important in our squad,\" he said.",
      "United have been in this situation previously, with AFCON looming during the campaign, but losing three players at once to the tournament is a new challenge for the club to manoeuvre. Amorim will be desperate to keep Mbeumo and Amad for as long as possible. Mbeumo has contributed six goals and an assist in 13 appearances this season, while Amad has also been important.",
      "Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui will be unavailable from the Wolves games on December 8 if they join up with their respective nations at the standard time, but the precedent set with Andre Onana in 2024 suggests an agreement could be reached to defer their flights to the tournament.",
      "Onana joined up late with Cameroon at the last AFCON. He played against Wigan Athletic and Tottenham in January 2024 (the tournament starts earlier this year) and travelled to the tournament using a private jet, but he was named on the bench for the opening game.",
      "That is something that United's players will consider - they may be willing to join up with their nations late for AFCON, but that could potentially affect their squad roles at the tournament. Mbeumo should be fine because he is a star for Cameroon and would start the first game even if he reports late. However, Amad and Mazraoui compete to start for their respective nations.",
      "United play Bournemouth on December 15 and take on Aston Villa on December 21. Those matches will be tricky and Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui could be kept back if an agreement is reached. December will be difficult again, so United will do everything they can to defer AFCON call-ups.",

      "\"I'm realistic,\" Senne Lammens told MEN Sport in October after, in just his second appearance for the club, he excelled as Manchester United beat Liverpool at Anfield. This measured response came to a question regarding the social media praise which was flooding his way since making his debut for the Reds against Sunderland.",
      "Things were overwhelmingly positive then and, in truth, they have stayed on that trajectory. Since assuming the first choice role, Lammens has proven to be the reliable safe hands which United have been crying out for. Altay Bayindir always feels like he has a mistake in him while if it wasn't errors letting him down, it was Andre Onana's antics which were holding him back - as proven against Lyon last season.",
      "But Lammens, despite being six years Onana's junior, oozes maturity and this has shown itself on the pitch. For the first time since starting at United, this maturity and responsibility he possesses will be put to the test. On Monday night, it was clear Lammens should have done better to stop Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's winner for Everton. The Belgian's blame is only partial - Bruno Fernandes could have done more and Leny Yoro's tackle was too half-hearted in such a critical position.",
      "However, once the shot was taken, Lammens did not set himself well enough. He was too far over to his right side meaning he was always going to struggle to get back across to his left when the former Chelsea man hit it. To his credit, the 23-year-old got a hand to it but it wasn't enough and the goalkeeper will accept he should have saved it.",
      "Now is the time for Lammens to bounce back and before the Everton game, he explained how his biggest strength will help him do just that. He told Inside Carrington: \"I think that [mentality] has always been one of my biggest strengths, it always has been because my character has always been a little more relaxed, at ease, more mellow and not really going too high or too low with the feelings.",
      "\"Also as a goalkeeper, if you want to be a support to the team, you also have to be reliable and not always doing the crazy stuff but doing the simple things good. I agree it is something that I am proud of but also something I check myself and do after every game.\"",
      "He added: \"When I was growing up I had difficulties with it [confidence] because as a young goalkeeper it is difficult. I was not always the best one in my age group and I also made a lot of mistakes so I think as a young goalkeeper sometimes it is really difficult to get over those mistakes but then you just keep working on it.",
      "\"I did do some psychology work when I was growing up but now I don’t really need it anymore, I think I help myself more and I like to journal a lot and writing down after every game makes it a little easier on the mind as well to not always think too much after games and then it is out of your head.\"",
      "Lammens seems to have a way of coping which has served him well so far. But this week will test it properly and it will be interesting to see how he performs.",

So the first couple of weeks was getting used to it, to be honest, so that is why I think the way that I was brought in was also a positive to give me the time and those first couple of weeks, which I needed, to adjust to training and get my level to the guys.",
      "\"In the games after it was easier because I was already used to it after a couple of weeks of training with the first team. The finishing you can feel… if you are just one step to the left they can see it and they just put it to the right of you.\"",
      "Since Lammens became the first choice at Old Trafford, he has impressed supporters with his performances. Prior to Monday night, United had not lost with the 23-year-old in goal. His displays have also been noticed by his national team too. Last week he made his first appearance for Belgium as they defeated Liechtenstein 7-0 in their final World Cup qualifier.",

      "Ruben Amorim is facing a nightmare scenario if Casemiro is booked for the fifth time this season. The Manchester United midfielder is walking a suspension tightrope after picking up his fourth yellow card of the campaign during Monday's 1-0 defeat against Everton.",
      "Should Casemiro receive one more caution between now and United's 19th Premier League fixture, he will serve a one-game ban. If the Brazil international does therefore pick up that yellow card and get a suspension, Amorim is poised to have a huge selection dilemma on his plate.",
      "This is because Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's direct replacement, isn't fancied by Amorim right now. Indeed, Ugarte has played just 346 minutes across ten appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions this season. The Uruguay international last started in the 3-1 defeat at Brentford in September.",
      "Casemiro has been United's first-choice No.6 for some time with Ugarte having to settle for a back-up role and Kobbie Mainoo acting as competition for Bruno Fernandes instead.",
      "With the players he has available, Amorim has found his midfield partnership and a ban for Casemiro would cause him a nightmare situation, especially as Ugarte has not been used much.",
      "Speaking in the build-up to his side's game against Everton, Amorim spoke in-depth about Ugarte and challenged him to training amid worries about his performances for the Reds.",
      "When asked if he was surprised by Ugarte's form at Old Trafford, Amorim said: \"No, I understand. If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle.",
      "\"And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "\"So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "Ugarte and Amorim worked together at Sporting CP before the Uruguay midfielder decided to leave for Paris Saint-Germain in a deal worth £51m in June 2023. However, he struggled at the Parc des Princes and departed after just over a year at the club, signing for United in August 2024.",
      "He made an instant impact under Erik ten Hag but started to struggle as the season wore on, with Casemiro displacing him near the end of last campaign with Amorim opting to make a change. This season, Ugarte has started just twice in the Premier League against Manchester City and Brentford.",

      "The midfielder popped up with two huge moments in the game as he scored a quick rebound header to give Napoli the lead just after the hour mark, while his effort just a few minutes later led to an own-goal, with the game ending 2-0 to the Azzurri.",
      "McTominay took to social media after the game with a post that reads: \"Champions league nights. The real MVP’s always,\" showing off a picture with the backroom staff.",
      "It continues an incredible run of form for the Scotland international, who has hit the heights ever since he made the move from Man United back in 2024.",
      "The midfielder played an important role in ensuring Scotland booked their place in the 2026 World Cup, beating Denmark and Hojlund to top spot in their qualifying group in the process.",
      "Now back at Napoli together, their form is in a different place to one another, with McTominay finding the back of the net regularly, while Hojlund is now searching for his first goal in six games.",

      "Ruben Amorim was asked how he felt after Manchester United's defeat to Everton. \"Frustration, disappointment about the way we played the game. I think they were the better team,\" he said.",
      "\"With 11, they defended really well. With 10 men, 70 minutes. So I think we deserved to lose. We didn't play well. We didn't play with the right intensity. That's it.\"",
      "But why did the players deliver such a shocking performance? \"We talk about this a lot of times,\" Amorim said. \"I know which point we are in the moment. I have that feeling during this run. I always talk about that.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions in the league. We have a lot to do and we need to be perfect to win. We were not perfect today.\"",
      "United should not need to be \"perfect\" to beat a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The decision to send off Idrissa Gana Gueye handed United a huge advantage with 77 minutes remaining, but Everton grew in belief they would claim a victory with every minute after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal.",
      "Everton did not look like a side missing a player on the pitch. United played into their hands, playing crosses into the box, which was illogical given the height of Everton's backline.",
      "United could not control the game, despite having the advantage of an extra man, and the decision to leave three centre-backs on the pitch didn't make sense. It felt like Amorim was being stubborn because if he had changed his system in an attempt to get back into the game there would be no going back.",
      "Everyone would have said, 'if you can change your system against Everton, why haven't you previously?' Amorim stuck by his system when logic said the team needed to be tweaked.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for Casemiro just before the hour mark, but bringing off Leny Yoro for the midfielder would have given United a better chance of gaining control.",
      "There was no need to have Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw on the pitch for the entire game when United desperately needed a goal. De Ligt missed a chance in added time, but he is a defender and cannot be blamed.",
      "Yoro had a game to forget, failing to commit to the challenge before Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring in the 29th minute, and he was the logical candidate to be removed for a midfielder.",
      "Amorim is risk-averse and should have played with three midfielders. Shea Lacey was the only attacking option on the bench once the changes had been made, but having an extra midfielder would have helped a lot.",
      "It would have allowed United to make their extra man advantage count, move the ball with purpose and make Everton's players tired. Then an opening likely would have emerged.",
      "Instead, crosses were played into the box, and Joshua Zirkzee was asked to find an equaliser with his head. Zirkzee drew a great save from Jordan Pickford, but he is not a competent goalscorer.",
      "Amorim was heaped with praise during an excellent October after overseeing wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but it's fair to criticise the United boss after such a shocking defeat.",
      "The 40-year-old's in-game management against a team with 10 men was poor. Amorim overlooked a potential solution - bringing on Mainoo for Yoro - because he wanted to continue with three at the back.",
      "Everton had only claimed a single victory in 32 years at Old Trafford in the Premier League, while David Moyes had failed to win at the ground in 17 attempts as a visiting manager. The odds were further stacked against Everton when Gana Gueye slapped his own teammate.",
      "\"It's been difficult to win here over the years, but over the recent seasons, I've felt I've come close,\" said Moyes during his press conference. \"But if you said I would get a result with 10 men, when it was 0-0, I would have said that would be really tough. It was a brilliant performance.\"",
      "United's defeat is made worse by the opportunity they had to climb into the Champions League places. The Reds would have moved to fifth position at the least if they had won against Everton.",
      "Amorim must inspire a response next weekend against Crystal Palace. He believes that he is a \"better manager\" after learning from last season, but he is still refusing to adapt.",

      "Gary Neville has slammed one moment from Manchester United's defeat to Everton in the Premier League. United were beaten 1-0 by the Toffees in the Monday Night Football to see their unbeaten run come to an end.",
      "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored the only goal of the game to hand United their fourth defeat in the Premier League this season. The game also saw Everton reduced to 10 men for much of the contest after Idrissa Gueye appeared to slap his own teammate, Michael Keane, in the first half.",
      "United had the numerical advantage for the majority of the game but could not make it count, as they fell to their first defeat in the league since September 27 against Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim and Co. will now prepare to face Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture at the weekend, where they will be determined to return to winning ways.",
      "It was also on commentary that Neville was not happy with a moment from Luke Shaw during the second half when United were trying to find an equaliser. Everton went long from a goal-kick as Neville highlighted the number of United players back in defence compared to the Everton players they were covering.",
      "\"You've got five defenders at the back. Why? And they didn't even win the header. Or the second ball. Embarrassing,\" Neville said.",
      "He added: \"[Luke] Shaw has started to move forward a little bit but he's ambling forward let's be clear.",
      "\"He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes and I am just going to say it. Look at him. You can't do that.",
      "\"You should be running forward every single time. I don't care. \"What he is doing there is a waste of time, you're not conning anybody. I am not having it.\"",
      "Neville also weighed in on the decision from referee Tony Harrington to send off Gueye in the first half for Everton. \"It's a coming together between him and Michael Keane. It always looks unsavoury when it's teammate on teammate,\" said Neville at the time of the incident.",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",
      "However, former Everton manager Roberto Martinez insisted the referee had no option but to show Gueye the red card.",
      "\"No I was very surprised because you need to be intense,\" Martinez said. \"You need to be intense. The reaction here, you've got a lot of bodies in the box.",
      "\"Obviously it's a bit of a misunderstanding [Gueye trying to play the ball to Keane and they blame each other]. Clearly it's a misunderstanding, Gueye is trying to play the ball but it's that reaction here, that slap, open hand.",
      "\"We've been talking about it many times. I think the referee has no other choice. When you see it there, the law tells you any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",

Cunha was expected to start at the false nine after Benjamin Sesko picked up a knock against Tottenham before the international break. However, Cunha has also picked up an injury and has not made the matchday squad.",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify the situation ahead of the clash with the Toffees, telling MUTV: \"It was a knock in training so I don’t know how long he’s going to stay out, I think it’s nothing serious, but we cannot risk players. We have to show everybody, when you are not 100 per cent, we have a different player to cope with the demands of the game.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee comes into the starting XI in place of Cunha. Zirkzee has not started a league game since April and was last on the scoresheet in the league against tonight's opponents back in December. Amorim added on the decision to start Zirkzee: \"I just want to see Josh playing well, with the quality he has.",
      "\"We have a problem with Ben [Sesko] and we have a problem with Cunha. He's working in that position. If you look at our team, I think Josh has, more or less, the same characteristics as Cunha in that position. We want to maintain what we worked with during the week and he is ready.\"",
      "United could move up to fourth with a win against Everton tonight. They head into the clash in tenth position in the table but could be just one point and one place behind Manchester City come the close of play.",
      "United beat Everton in the corresponding fixture last season to claim their first win under Ruben Amorim. Marcus Rashford and Zirkzee both scored twice to seal comfortable 4-0 win."

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Manuel Ugarte to improve in training sessions amid concerns about his performances for Manchester United this season. Ugarte got off to a mixed start in Manchester after his €50million (£42.3m) transfer, with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024.",
      "The midfielder was expected to improve after the appointment of Amorim. Ugarte played his best football under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, but he's been unable to reproduce those levels so far at Old Trafford. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions. Amorim was asked whether he was surprised by Ugarte's form and challenged him to improve. \"No, I understand. If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "\"So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "There has been speculation around Ugarte's future. Amorim was ruthless last summer, deciding Rasmus Hojlund should leave after a disappointing campaign. Benjamin Sesko has been sidelined with a knee injury, but Amorim does not regret allowing Hojlund to join Napoli.",
      "\"Our thinking is that we need two strikers,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer players that make two positions, because sometimes in these clubs it's hard to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say if Ben has an injury, you have more time to play. It's impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that's why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "\"If you have an injury, that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.\"",
      "Sesko picked up his knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim mentioned Manchester United youngsters Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher when he was asked how the team would cope with losing key players to the Africa Cup of Nations. Lacey and Fletcher took part in first-team training at Carrington on Friday morning, suggesting they have a chance of being named in the matchday squad when Everton visit Old Trafford.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was ruled out of facing Tottenham before the international break due to a knock, which opened the door for Fletcher to come into the first-team squad in London. Fletcher’s inclusion continued United's 88-year record of naming an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher's son has made progress since joining from Manchester City two years ago, and has acquitted himself well playing against senior opposition in the EFL Trophy and National League Cup. Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at a press conference on Friday. Speaking about losing players to AFCON, he said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Chido Obi made seven appearances in the Premier League last season, but the young striker has not been named in a senior squad so far this term. Obi has played for the Under-21s, developing away from the spotlight, and Amorim believes he was overexposed last term due to injuries.",
      "\"Yeah, of course, he played last year,\" Amorim said about whether Obi was someone who could step up. \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "Speaking about trusting young players, Amorim said: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy, they are preparing the academy, we are paying more attention to them, we are talking with them.",
      "\"Just that is so important for us, to change information about the players, what they need, how they behave, even to call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well, if you don't behave really well. This connection is really important, we are trying to do that, we are putting everything in place.",
      "\"Nutritionist for the academy starts now, in our club. That is something that should be basic, so all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job, so I have more times with them, with training.",
      "\"So I'm more confident with them, when we put these kids to play in Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think, so I think everyone in the academy, are doing a very good job in the moment.\"",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Pep Guardiola chucking out a ludicrously expensive second string to lose to Leverkusen got us thinking: what is the best possible Premier League back-up XI?",
      "Only one Manchester City player actually makes it into our selection, which is comprised strictly of back-up options. That means no-one who has been rotated in and out of the side. We want those who, all things being equal, are currently staring up in the pecking order.",
      "Hugo Ekitike? Not a back-up. Another Liverpool forward soon to be mentioned? Very much a back-up.",
      "",
      "A contentious option to start, with the closest competition coming from Liverpool and Manchester City. And perhaps there are flavour-of-the-month vibes to picking Ramsdale, who is the back-up keeper du jour following Nick Pope’s struggles.",
      "But Ramsdale is also just an obviously good keeper whose career extremes have made it difficult to identify his true level. He might not be the Champions League-adjacent Premier League runner-up he became at Arsenal, yet he clearly isn’t the sort of player who should have been relegated in his last three seasons away from the Emirates.",
      "There is a middle ground in which he exists and Newcastle is one of the better places to underline that. His chance should come soon.",
      "",
      "Mikel Arteta felt White “probably was our best player” in pre-season and has promised “he will have minutes to play” after being sidelined first through injury and then by the brilliance of Jurrien Timber.",
      "White is not the first player to harshly yet justifiably lose his place in the starting line-up during this Arsenal transformation. As obviously good as he is, Timber is a better and slightly more rounded fit.",
      "Yet only five players have ever featured more under Arteta and there is a clear belief White can be trusted when needed. It could be soon, with Timber at mild risk of being run into the actual ground.",
      "",
      "There is a risk of this becoming an Arsenal second XI with one of their former players between the sticks. They do have comfortably the best back-up side in the Premier League so it would make sense.",
      "But that strength in depth is most present in defence, where Mosquera can be trusted to thrive at Anfield after being chucked on five minutes in at the age of 21.",
      "Arsenal have come a long way from the days of Rob actual Holding being next in line.",
      "",
      "Where will the Andrea Berta statue even go?",
      "",
      "The issue with the ‘back-up’ delineation is arguably most evident with Hall, whose injuries make it difficult to accurately assess his standing in the Newcastle squad.",
      "It is likely that, when able and available to play two or three times a week, Hall will again settle into the role of reliable starter and largely overlooked England left-back option.",
      "But Eddie Howe is also Eddie Howe and so Hall’s fitness might not be the most important consideration while Dan Burn exists.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim appears to have successfully navigated the minefield created by ostracising Mainoo and, as a result, completely tanking the transfer value of a player Manchester United will not be able to resist the temptation to sell.",
      "Mainoo has played 260 minutes all season, starting against only Grimsby in the League Cup, but the narrative has largely moved on. A starter for England in the Euro 2024 final will play no part in the conversation over the 2026 World Cup squad. Largely because he is apparently not as good as Manuel Ugarte.",

      "In an exceptional example of BlueCo Chelsea nonsense, Santos has emerged as a legitimately excellent midfield option having signed during the reign of Graham Potter.",
      "The Brazilian was sent on loan a couple of months later, returning to rather inexplicably find Frank Lampard in the hotseat. Then by the time he came back from six months at Nottingham Forest, it was Mauricio Pochettino calling the shots. A season and a half with Strasbourg later, Enzo Maresca was presiding over a quite ridiculous squad.",
      "And Santos has his place within it. Not ahead of Moises Caicedo or Enzo Fernandez, but high enough in the pecking order to be trusted starting the odd Premier League game or making cameos against Barcelona.",
      "",
      "Seventeen players have been given more minutes, yet only four have more combined goals and assists for Liverpool this season than Chiesa, who does seem to possess whatever the opposite of Arne Slot’s nudes are. Pictures of Arne Slot fully clothed? Or with hair? The Dutchman is not taking the threats of blackmail seriously either way.",
      "Chiesa was initially omitted from the club’s Champions League squad and ranks fifth for the most Premier League minutes of any player yet to start a game in the competition this season. That is a list Mainoo tops ahead of Ethan Nwaneri, Omari Hutchinson and Vitaly Janelt, and not one a 28-year-old Italy international wishes to find himself on in a World Cup year.",
      "Despite being as productive in front of goal as Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak put together, Chiesa remains on the periphery.",
      "",
      "In his first 22 games of a half-season after he joined Manchester City in January, Marmoush scored eight goals and assisted three. Fourteen appearances have followed, in which he has both scored and assisted only once each.",
      "A player whose performances seemed to imply a level of talent able to embrace at least some of the burden placed on Erling Haaland’s shoulders has come to represent Manchester City’s collective impotence without the Nordic goalbot.",
      "Pep Guardiola has praised Marmoush for his “patience” but injury and a drip-feed of minutes has killed the Egyptian’s momentum after a glittering start to Premier League life.",
      "",
      "Perhaps in a show of solidarity with disgruntled supporters, it has emerged that Tel is ‘unhappy’ at Spurs.",
      "Not sure why. Could be his exclusion from the club’s Champions League squad, or the fact that despite only four teammates having scored more goals this season, he remains a distinctly unfancied option in an absurdly limited attack.",
      "Only Richarlison and Micky van de Ven have scored more Premier League goals than the forward Spurs signed from Bayern Munich for £30m. What a sad sentence.",

      "By our calculations, the only Chelsea player who entirely shunned long sleeves against Barcelona. And because the spirit of Barclays which flows irrevocably through his veins clearly provides enough warmth, of course he sodding scored.",
      "Delap does have more world champion medals and red cards than goals in the Premier League for Chelsea, but it must be preferable to ploughing the most lonely of furrows for Ipswich.",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "According to reports, three Manchester United players are ‘set’ to leave the Premier League giants during this winter transfer window.",
      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping tabs on a former Red Devil for a shock return from a Premier League rival on a free transfer.",
      "United are doing better than they did last season. Indeed, they finished 15th in the Premier League, beating the eighth-placed finish the season prior for their worst in the competition.",
      "They have flirted with the top four this term – they’re currently 10th in the league but only three points off fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "While there’s been much-needed progress under Ruben Amorim, there are still some shortfalls. Casemiro’s resurgence in the midfield has been welcome, though he’s still not the most consistent performer, and he’s playing alongside Bruno Fernandes, who should be playing further up the field.",
      "Beyond that pair, Amorim does not seem massively fond of Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo and could instead sign James Garner.",
      "Links with a number of star Premier League midfielders have surfaced in recent months, with it known that’s the area they’re likely to prioritise next.",
      "But the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely in January as they’ll cost huge sums, and each will have a lot of interest in the summer.",
      "The links with Garner, as per talkSPORT, could mean for a welcome transfer for no fee at all. Garner is out of contract at Everton at the end of the season and Everton are said to be stepping up contract talks.",
      "But United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are all said to be keeping tabs on the situation, in case a renewal does not come to fruition.",
      "Should United land Garner, he’d be returning to the club he played his academy football for – where he was a star, but then played just seven times in the first team before being sold to Everton for just £15million.",
      "If United are able to bring him back on a free, they’d not have the embarrassment of paying a huge sum for a former academy player they let go, as was the case with Paul Pogba.",
      "Garner showed the Red Devils first hand his effectiveness as Everton beat them 1-0 on Monday night – the midfielder assisted the only goal of the game, while he also made three interceptions and one clearance, per SofaScore.",
      "United could certainly do worse than bringing the 24-year-old back, particularly if it’s for no fee.",

      "According to reports, Joshua Zirkzee has ‘said yes’ to leaving Manchester United in January and a transfer is ‘now closer’ to happening.",
      "Zirkzee was among Man Utd’s signings during the 2024 summer transfer window as he joined the Red Devils from Bologna for around £36.5m.",
      "The Dutchman had a mixed debut season at Old Trafford as he only scored three Premier League goals in 32 games, but he certainly outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the run-in.",
      "This led to Hojlund leaving Man Utd to join Napoli in the summer on loan with an option to buy for around £44m, while Zirkzee stuck around to provide cover for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Zirkzee was also linked with an exit in the summer as several Serie A sides were linked with a move for the versatile forward and it is looking like he could be on the move in the winter.",
      "READ: ‘Ambling’ Luke Shaw among five Man Utd players doomed in 2026",
      "The 24-year-old has only been a bit-part player this season and did not take his chance from the start against Everton on Monday night as the Red Devils suffered an embarrassing 1-0 home loss against ten men.",
      "Zirkzee’s poor display against Everton has added fuel to reports linking him with a January transfer and a report from Italian outlet Gazzetta claims a move to Serie A giants AS Roma is ‘now closer’.",
      "This is said to be after Zirkzee ‘said yes’ to Roma, who have reportedly made an initial loan with a buy option offer to Man Utd.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could join Zirkzee in leaving in the winter to boost his chances of playing for England at next summer’s World Cup, but Harry Maguire will not be going anywhere.",
      "Maguire has been in and out of Man Utd’s team this season and he is in the final year of his contract, but it has emerged that he is likely to sign an extension.",
      "The England international has become a fans’ favourite at Old Trafford and is admired by Ruben Amorim due to his positive work ethic.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims a new contract for Maguire has become a ‘priority’ at Man Utd and he is ‘fully expected to agree’ an extension.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘United do have plans to sign another centre back in the summer – but they do not want that to be as a replacement for Maguire.",

      "They had been praised for their improved form under head coach Ruben Amorim as his tactical tweaks and the positive impact made by summer signings contributed to their five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "This is why the 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton was so disappointing, with this result putting Amorim and his players back under intense scrutiny.",
      "Man Utd will look to return to winning ways this weekend as they travel to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, but they will soon be dealt a further blow as Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are set to feature at next month’s African Cup of Nations.",

      "At the moment, Man Utd’s game against Wolves at Molineux on December 8 is due to be their final match before the major tournament, but a report from The Daily Mail are reportedly trying to keep them for the match against Bournemouth on December 15.",
      "United are said to be ‘scrambling to keep this star trio for an extra game’ and they ‘will accelerate discussions’ over their ‘release dates’ in the coming days.",

      "The report claims:",
      "‘Confidential revealed that United struck a deal with Cameroon so Andre Onana ended up missing only one game during the last AFCON two years ago, and Amorim confirmed last week that the club are exploring ways to hold onto Mbeumo, Diallo and Mazraoui for as long as possible.’",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, has issued a warning to summer signing Benjamin Sesko and explained why he is not guaranteed to start for Man Utd when he’s fit.",
      "“We did that against Liverpool. It wasn’t with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha, and it is an option we have,” Amorim claimed.",
      "“Nowadays, not only in the English league but also in the Portuguese league and across all leagues, there is a big variation in how teams build their play. We do not control it fully. We can call it a 4-4-2, but after five minutes it becomes a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3.",
      "“I am willing to do anything. Contrary to what many people think, I am not fixed on just one idea. I simply start from a base, but it is obvious that we can adapt in future.",
      "“We have already considered that with Bryan, because he is very strong in transitions. I do not think it is his best position, because he prefers to stay hidden and not be so visible. He can attack and be more dangerous on either side, whether on the right or the left, than as a central forward.",
      "“But it is a good option and something I could use in future, as I have already done several times in the past.”",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the recent record of Arne Slot at Liverpool “reads like” Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as he wants to see the Reds boss “rinsed” like ...",

      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was “absolutely furious” with two of his players for their performance against Everton.",
      "Who carries the can for Man Utd being so docile in defeat to Everton? Ruben Amorim’s rigidity did not help, but the players’ passiveness spoke volumes…"

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "Estevao gets all of the love after that Chelsea performance to make Lamine Yamal look like a has-been.",
      "Estevao announced himself on the world stage against Lamine Yamal and Chelsea underlined their Champions League credentials by dismantling Barcelona.",
      "Thomas Frank is learning quickly that focusing on eliminating risk can in its own way be the biggest risk of all. Especially at Spurs."

      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",
      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "… Not with Pickford in his form. Consecutive clean sheets and a string of saves at Manchester United, who failed to score from a PSxG of 1.8, see the Everton stopper climb here. Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",

      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",

      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",

      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",

      "After nearly two months of glorious respite, here we are yet again, apportioning blame for Manchester United being sh*te.",
      "The Red Devils were dire in defeat to Everton, despite David Moyes side playing all but 13 minutes with 10 men. So submissive were the hosts at Old Trafford that the Toffees literally fighting among themselves was highlighted as one of the many areas United could improve.",
      "Who is responsible for a performance that lacked minimum levels of intensity, nous and ingenuity?",
      "The short answer: all of ’em. There is enough blame to spread around all the coaching staff and squad inside the United dressing room. We’ve conducted this post-mortem many, many times before. Must we open the corpse yet again? Oh, we must…",
      "Jamie Carragher says the manager should ‘take a lot of the blame’ after sticking so rigidly to his formation, despite the events that were unfolding in front of him.",
      "“It is my fault,” said Amorim post-match, accepting responsibility in that way that managers do, when they have no intention of shouldering the blame for anything other than picking from a group of players who, apparently, cannot think for themselves.",
      "“I need to be better, to explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game.” The fact he immediately then zeroed in on those players’ for “starting the game with a different intensity” to Everton was a more accurate reflection of his mindset.",
      "This is the thing with Amorim. He is honest. Sometimes painfully so. He is so dreadful at hiding his frustration when his players fail to achieve the bare minimum that he no longer tries. Not really.",
      "It is actually quite endearing. And it almost certainly buys him more patience with Stretford Enders than his results deserve. But the credit earned by his honesty and open disdain for the players wrecking his head is almost immediately wiped out by his absolute, devout devotion to his system. Carragher called it is ‘baby’ and we hope for his actual children’s sake that Amorim is never put in the admittedly unlikely situation where he has to choose between them or 3-4-2-1.",
      "We are only left to speculate why the United players, seemingly dead behind the eyes, steadfastly remained in that very formation, with no will or wherewithal for spontaneity, after Idrissa Gueye’s early red card.",
      "It should have been on Luke Shaw or Lenny Yoro to step forward as United’s extra man, an advantage they wasted by clinging to their defensive position like a tatty comfort blanket.",
      "Was that Amorim’s insistence? Or are all of his players now so drilled in this shape that any adaptation is utterly beyond them? Tell us either is true and we would not question it.",
      "The abject inability of players to think for themselves, or even look after themselves, is a far wider problem beyond Old Trafford. Coaches preach about empowering players to find solutions in the game while simultaneously prescribing every minor movement in and out of possession. The contradiction goes all the way to academies and grassroots, leaving us with players at every level incapable of reacting to any scenario they haven’t meticulously rehearsed.",
      "The game is poorer because we forget that football is about players, not cultish coaches and their desire to show how pure and clever their philosophy is. Which, with almost no exceptions, is ripped off someone else anyway.",
      "But at the top level, it is easy to understand why coaches insist on mapping out every intricate detail, each run and pass, when they are only ever five games from the sack. If Amorim, like many managers at other clubs, was to place any of his faith in these players, he knows he is destined for a fall. So, instead, it becomes about systems, not players.",
      "If Amorim genuinely feels he must “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game”, he’s screwed. But he doesn’t really. Yet he’s still screwed.",
      "Because after a year in charge and some glimmers of encouragement of late that must have had United players believing their own press through the international break, they can still turn up and turn in performances like this which are part of a pattern against teams in the bottom half.",
      "Slate Amorim for his system or his like-for-like substitutes, but it was clear from literally the first minute that United’s players were failing to match the intensity of their visitors, despite the chance to position themselves among the Champions League chasers. Motivation cannot and should not be spoon-fed by the manager, it has to come from within.",
      "Passing up that opportunity so meekly – or worse, failing even to recognise it – says more about this United side than the five games they went unbeaten just to remain in their rightful place: entrenched in mid-table.",
      "It’s good news for England after a World Cup draw change, not that you’d know it from one headline, while there’s big news about Martin Odegaard that isn’t.",
      "Liverpool fans reacting to news of a £25m bid for Marc Guehi with anything other than relief shows football has jumped the shark.",
      "Is it already going wrong for Thomas Frank and Tottenham? We think it might be. And we think it might quickly get worse.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",
      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Estevao gets all of the love after that Chelsea performance to make Lamine Yamal look like a has-been."

This misses the point that managers resign from jobs incredibly rarely, unless they have another job to go to, because they can stay and be paid to leave. That looks unlikely in Slot’s case because there doesn’t seem to be an obvious replacement out there for him.",
      "It would be a bold decision on his part to leave at this very moment. The Premier League is mad this year in terms of how bunched up so many teams are. To use Crystal Palace as an example, before this season their best points return after 12 games was 19 (six wins and one draw, 2015-16), which put them in 10th place, and the only other time they’ve won as many as five games (with two draws), 2020-21, had them 11th with 17 points.",

The three-point gap between Villa and Liverpool is comparable to the equivalents (final playoff place to 13th) in the Championship, League One and League Two, all of which are infamously built on shifting sands. It’s entirely conceivable that if Liverpool could turn things around in very short order and be right back in the mix for the top four. Automatic Champions League qualification would constitute a successful season (if not a successful title defence).",
      "* Speaking of bold decisions to leave a club, Saturday saw Rob Edwards take charge of Wolves for the first time. Now, maybe it’s just me but I’ve never understood why people, and it tends to be a certain type of British manager more than most, would leave an environment where they are building something special and overachieving to move up the pecking order to a basket case club where it is incredibly likely they will fail. Graham Potter is a strong example here, leaving Brighton to go to a chaotic Chelsea where he was found to be out of his depth in fairly short order. His reputation took a hit and, following his time at West Ham, hasn’t really recovered.",
      "Edwards, meanwhile, has just left a Middlesbrough side he got well on course for promotion to join a club looking incredibly likely to pass them going the other way. His old side have lost just two league games so far this season, his new side have lost all bar two. It will be a truly remarkable feat if Edwards can keep Wolves in the Premier League, but it’s easy to think his best chance of managing in the Premier League beyond this year would have been to stay with Boro.",
      "* One of the reasons supporting Crystal Palace is rarely dull for long is that they keep defying expectations. That’s probably why so many of us expected them to lose to a Wolves team they should, on paper, beat comfortably. Instead, we were treated to the sort of professional performance that shouldn’t be an issue but too often is. Palace were, by some distance, the better team on Saturday afternoon and their win, combined with results elsewhere, took them temporarily to fourth in the table (they’ve since been overtaken by Aston Villa).",
      "* During the international break the Athletic published two articles about Palace, one discussing their struggles to break down a low block and the other about how they had never won the first game back from an international break under Oliver Glasner. This, and the game against Wolves, highlight why Glasner is so well-liked amongst the fans in a way that many of his predecessors weren’t. He gets that it won’t be perfect, because it’s Palace, but he gets a lot right. He’s a planner but he’s also has good judgement about when to change the plan or when to stick to it.",
      "The only concern fans do have is that he is exacerbating the lack of squad depth he has previously commented on by not rotating players or leaving it late to make substitutions. His first change on Saturday, Eddie Nketiah on for Jean-Philippe Mateta, was a subtle tactical shift even if it was one centre-forward for another, but a goal arrived a couple of minutes afterwards. Then, with the game at 2-0 and largely over as a contest, he waited a further 12 minutes to make any more substitutions.",
      "It’s a minor thing, but the fresh legs in midfield being introduced straight after the goal, for example, would have sent a message to those players that they were being trusted to see out a winning position for an extended period. But as I say, it’s a very minor thing.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "The Red Devils crashed down to earth on Monday night as their five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League ended.",
      "Amorim‘s side hosted Everton at Old Trafford and suffered an embarrassing 1-0 loss despite the Toffees going down to ten men inside the opening 15 minutes.",
      "Idrissa Gueye was sent off in unique circumstances as he clashed with teammate Michael Keane, but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall broke the deadlock with a stunning strike from distance.",
      "Man Utd then dominated possession, but could not equalise as Everton defended brilliantly to earn a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",

      "READ: Amorim and ’embarrassing’ Man Utd return to the doldrums vs ten-man Everton",
      "“They have four guys who are two metres at the back, so crosses are going to be difficult.",
      "“I think we lacked the patience to play between the lines and play on the floor. I think we crossed a lot of balls but obviously they are really strong in that aspect. But still we have to do a lot more than this.”",
      "In response to these comments, Rooney explained what Man Utd’s “big problem” was against Everton.",
      "“They were certainly favourites to win the game tonight and Everton going to 10 men, you think they’re going to kick on and win the game comfortably,” Rooney said.",
      "“I think, as De Ligt just said there, they forced too many balls, they were crossing the balls at times when they didn’t need to cross it. If they’d stayed a bit more patient and pulled Everton out of position…that was a big problem for them tonight.”",
      "Rooney also criticised Amorim, who should have “changed the system” to help break Everton down and did not need to keep Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw on the pitch.",
      "He added: “I would like to see them change the system.",
      "“I know Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were stepping in and trying to add an extra player in midfield. But when you’ve got an extra player, having a more creative player in his natural position would have made the difference.",

      "It wasn’t Graeme Le Saux vs David Batty and frankly pathetic in comparison to the shirt-ripping majesty of Kieron Dyer vs Lee Bowyer, which meant that rather than being treated to a joyous “they’re having a fight?!” line on commentary, everyone but referee Tony Harrington was initially confused as to exactly why Idrissa Gueye had been given his marching orders at Old Trafford.",
      "We’re absolutely here for a footballer being sent off for slapping one of their own teammates. It’s far more gratifying than them striking a member of the opposition, not least in this instance because we were treated to David Moyes’ wonderful post-match revelation that “I actually like my players fighting”. Lovely stuff.",
      "It’s a weird rule though. Gueye wouldn’t have been sent off for an accidental studs-up challenge over the ball on Keane, for example. Nor for denying him a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "It felt like a crushing blow at the time for Everton, who had been very, very comfortable up to that point in the 13th minute against a Manchester United side who had offered little but have looked like a semi-serious football team for the last couple of months.",
      "An attacking midfielder finding space behind the United double-pivot, taking advantage of some weak defending and then scoring past a limp-wristed goalkeeper who failed to get off the ground is vintage pre-October 2025 Manchester United.",
      "Quite how Everton, a side hardly famed for their ability to pop the ball around with 11 men, albeit with an uptick in possession this season under Moyes, were able to open up that space for and find Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall without a Manchester United player getting anywhere near any of them in the build-up was again, classic rock-bottom stuff from the Red Devils.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was weak, Leny Yoro weaker still and goalkeeper extraordinaire Senne Lammens got his timing all wrong to make what was a half-decent turn, touch and shot from Dewsbury-Hall look like the work of a world-class playmaker.",
      "And it had been coming. Not because of any sort of barrage on Lammens’ goal from the visitors, but because United afforded them absurdly easy possession, sleeping through 15 minutes after Gueye’s dismissal. After which, significantly, David Moyes didn’t feel the need to sacrifice one of his forwards to replace one of the Premier League’s foremost midfield destroyers, such was the lack of threat from the home side.",
      "An increase in Manchester United pressure in the second half came mainly in the form of delivering crosses towards two Everton centre-backs famously accomplished at dealing with balls in the air and two or three United players, whom Gary Neville listed one after the other with a “can’t head it” suffix.",
      "Without Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury, Amorim turned to Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Diogo Dalot to change the game in United’s favour. But he steadfastly refused to even tweak his much-maligned system, to Neville’s bemusement.",
      "“Still didn’t win the first ball, or the second – embarrassing,” Neville said as Thierno Barry set the season-record for aerial balls won (14) from a Jordan Pickford long ball as United lined up with their customary five in defence. But the majority of the co-commentator’s wrath was reserved for Luke Shaw.",
      "He’s got one pace, summed up by Neville when he spotted him “ambling forward” from left centre-back, rather than bombing on as you might expect when marking no-one for 80 minutes of a game of football. “What he’s doing is a waste of time,” Neville added of a footballer who did once, admittedly a while ago, get to the byline and deliver crosses.",
      "Yoro has never been that guy and that was made very clear by his staunch refusal to cross the ball from the inside right position on any of the 427 occasions he was handed the opportunity.",
      "Pickford produced one sublime save to deny Joshua Zirkzee, who fluffed another couple of headers, and Bruno Fernandes missed a clearcut chance for United. But while it felt frantic, that energy came from United, not Everton, whose defenders dealt expertly with the balls into the box as Dewsbury-Hall, Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye worked tirelessly to drag them up the pitch, win free-kicks and relieve pressure whenever possible.",
      "A brilliant performance from Everton and a significant reality check for Amorim, whose greatest concern will be how easily his Manchester United side reverted to their 2025 norm, while very familiar frustrations over the manager’s refusal to adjust his system no matter the circumstances will rear their ugly but entirely reasonable heads in the aftermath.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",

      "\"These five weeks, everyone is praising our evolution. But I'm always saying the same things: we are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be in this club.\"",
      "Gueye's bizarre red card left Amorim wishing he had seen the same sort of fight from his own players.",
      "\"Fighting is not a bad thing,\" he added. \"Fighting doesn't mean you don't like each other. Fighting means you lose the ball and I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling.",
      "\"I don't agree with that red card. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other - though they cannot get sent off! But that is a good feeling, not a bad feeling.\"",

      "\"I feel afraid of returning to this feeling of last season,\" said Amorim. \"That is my biggest concern. We need to work together. The players are trying but we need to be better.\"",
      "Gary Neville branded United's performance as an \"embarrassment\" at Old Trafford - while Jamie Carragher feels Amorim's credentials will be questioned on the basis of that performance.",
      "Amorim was criticised throughout the match for not moving away from his much-maligned 3-4-2-1 formation and continuing with five defenders on the pitch, despite having the player advantage.",
      "\"It was nowhere near good enough,\" said Neville on the Gary Neville Podcast. \"That was a really bad night for Man Utd, it was an embarrassment at times.",
      "\"Forget [injuries to Sesko and Cunha], there are no excuses. I'm not entertaining that one bit.",

      "In extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford, Gueye got into an argument with centre-back Keane early in the first half and replays showed the midfielder raise his hands to the Everton defender's face. Gueye apologised to his team-mates at full-time.",
      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",
      "The midfielder's solo run got him to the edge of the box before he fired past Senne Lammens' outstretched gloves and into the net - with more questions falling to a United goalkeeper this season.",
      "United failed to take full advantage of their extra man in the first half, with their players booed off after their best chance was a Bruno Fernandes 30-yard strike which Jordan Pickford simply saved.",
      "United - missing Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury - started the second half in a similar vein. Half-time substitute Mason Mount put two chances wide, while Bryan Mbeumo saw an effort saved by Pickford.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" said Neville. \"They still don't win the first ball or second ball. Embarrassing.",
      "\"The subs have taken him down a cul-de-sac. There's no agility or flexibility firstly from the coach, but also the players.\"",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (4); Yoro (5), De Ligt (5), Shaw (3); Mazraoui (4), Casemiro (3), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (4); Amad (4), Zirkzee (3), Mbeumo (5)\n\n\nSubs:  Mount (4), Dalot (4), Mainoo (4)\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (9); Coleman (n/a), Tarkowski (8), Keane (8), Mykolenko (7); Gueye (1), Garner (7), Dewsbury-Hall (9); Ndiaye (8), Barry (8), Grealish (8) \n\n\nSubs:  O’Brien (7), Beto (n/a), Iroegbunam (n/a), McNel (n/a), Alcaraz (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "United almost found a way through when Joshua Zirkzee, starting his first United game for 225 days, forced Pickford into two wonder saves, before he then headed a Kobbie Mainoo cross wide.",
      "More boos rang out at full-time as former United coach David Moyes got his first win at Old Trafford as a visiting manager. For Amorim, this is a massive low.",
      "\"Frustration, disappointment with the way we played the game. They were the better team with 11 men. They defended really well with 10 men for 70 minutes. We deserved to lose. We didn't play well, with the right intensity.",

      "Despite his sending off, Everton went on to win 1-0 thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal, and afterwards Gueye apologised to his team-mates in the changing room and released a statement on social media.",

      "\"The referee has no other choice because the law tells you that any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "According to the Premier League rules, striking an opponent or any other person on the head or face with their hand or arm represents violent conduct, unless the force used was negligible.",
      "\"Was it negligible?\" pondered Neville. \"That's the question. I think it was negligible. I don't think there was much in that at all.\"",
      "Gueye is now set to be suspended for Everton's next three games.",
      "The Senegal international became the first Premier League player sent off for striking his own team-mate since Ricardo Fuller for Stoke City against West Ham in 2008.",
      "It was only the third time a player has been sent off for striking a team-mate, after Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer's infamous double-red card in 2005.",
      "When Bowyer and Dyer clashed in 2005, the former was handed a seven-game ban in total - an initial four games for it being his second red card of the season, before the FA handed an additional three matches to the suspension.",
      "Bowyer was also given a £30,000 fine, with the midfielder then leaving for West Ham in the following summer.",
      "Meanwhile, in 2008, Stoke striker Fuller was sent off for striking his captain Andy Fuller. The striker claimed the situation actually helped team morale. Fuller stayed at Stoke until 2012.",
      "\"It's one of those things. It's done and dusted, and it's made us stronger as a unit,\" Fuller said.",
      "\"Sometimes in life, negatives can bring about positives, and I'm pleased that we've got by it in a positive way.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
