      "Manchester United have already received a ringing endorsement of new striker Benjamin Sesko from Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek. The Red Devils signed the RB Leipzig forward in a deal worth up to £74million, with Sesko penning a five-year contract at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is hoping Sesko can lead his new-look attack alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The 22-year-old is considered one of Europe's most exciting centre-forwards and joins United after netting 21 goals for Leipzig across all competitions last season.",
      "The striker was on Arsenal's radar earlier this summer and ultimately opted to sign for the Red Devils over a move to Newcastle United. Slovenia boss Kek has witnessed Sesko's development over the last four years and knows exactly what the striker will offer United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024. \"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one.",
      "\"It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success].\"",
      "It appears Sesko's impressive attitude will slot seamlessly into the atmosphere Amorim is building at United. On the field, despite regularly playing alongside the physical Aleksandar Mitrovic for his country, Kek highlighted Sesko's commanding presence up front - a quality that will only have developed further over the past year.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Kek gave Sesko his Slovenia debut the day after his 18th birthday, with the forward netting 16 times in 41 appearances for his country. Sesko's new boss Amorim agreed with Kek's verdict before seeing the striker in action for United.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels, and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group, so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special, but what really excites me is the future,\" Sesko said after joining the club. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "In an effort to determine how to deal with a dilemma like Alexander Isak, Eddie Howe could do worse than mimic the example set by Sir Alex Ferguson. Newcastle find themselves with a wantaway superstar desperate to leave the club for pastures new, as Manchester United did when Cristiano Ronaldo showed a liking towards Real Madrid in 2008.",
      "Isak, 25, has made no secret of his desire to leave St. James' Park, which has led to him being frozen out of the squad on the eve of the new Premier League campaign. The Athletic reported Isak, who was already the subject of a rejected £120million bid from Liverpool, is \"adamant\" he'll never play in black and white again, having grown despondent after learning he won't yet be offered a new contract.",
      "The details are different, but certain aspects of the stand-off closely resemble United's predicament with Ronaldo 17 years ago. The Portugal talisman had just led the Red Devils to Champions League glory, prompting then-Real president Ramon Calderon to publicly proclaim his intention to make the world-beater one of his own.",
      "Ferguson, 83, didn't take kindly to the declaration and informed his player as such, though there was a caveat to his defiance. Writing in his 2013 memoir, 'My Autobiography', the Scot struck a secret agreement with the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner that he would remain for one more year before being allowed to leave on United's terms.",
      "A passage from the book read: \"I found the boy expressing an urge to go to Real Madrid, and told him, 'You can’t go this year, not after the way Calderon has approached the issue.'",
      "\"I said, ‘I know you want to go to Real Madrid, but I’d rather shoot you than sell you to that guy now. If you perform, don’t mess us about, and someone comes and offers us a world-record fee, then we will let you go.' I had already conveyed that message to his agent, Jorge Mendes.",
      "\"I did well to calm him down. I told him the reason I was refusing to sell him that year was because of Calderon. I said, 'If I do that, all my honour's gone, everything's gone for me, and I don't care if you have to sit in the stands. I know it won't come to that, but I just have to tell you I will not let you leave this year.'\"",
      "The rest is history. Ronaldo saw out one more season at Old Trafford before joining Real for a then-world-record fee of £80m after Florentino Perez took over as Calderon's presidential successor in Madrid.",
      "It ended up being money very well spent on their part, and Ferguson got to keep his honour intact. The same perhaps can't be said for Isak at this rate after reportedly stating his intent to sit in the stands rather than play for Newcastle again.",
      "And if Howe were to replicate Ferguson's line of logic, he may have to make peace with the possibility of Isak seeing out significant game time on the sidelines. It's all but impossible to envision in this day and age, but both Howe and his Saudi bosses have to consider that possibility, with no obvious suitors lining up to meet his supposed £150m price-tag at this stage of the transfer window.",
      "The Swede's alleged act of defiance has angered the talkSPORT duo of Gabby Agbonlahor and Ally McCoist, who criticised his actions on Tuesday. And the pair believe Isak's summer shenanigans, which include missing Newcastle's pre-season tour and training at former club Real Sociedad, have only harmed his appeal in the long run.",
      "Former Aston Villa striker Agbonlahor took aim at Isak after hearing the latest developments and asked: \"Who does he think he is? Disgusting, what that club has done for you.\"",
      "Scottish football icon McCoist hammered home the point by questioning whether Isak's behaviour was becoming of an elite transfer target: \"If you're Liverpool, is that the kind of person you want to be signing?\"",

      "The survey, commissioned by one of Europe's leading real-time scores apps, questioned more than 3,000 football fans on their experiences in 2025. LiveScore uncovered that just 21 per cent of Premier League fans agreed that it was easy to get tickets to watch the action live, with 81 per cent citing availability and pricing as the two biggest stumbling blocks.",
      "The blackout rule was imposed in the 1960s to encourage fans to attend lower league games across the country, and it was protected in the last domestic TV rights deal, which will run until at least 2029. This means that no match can be televised between 2:45pm and 5:25pm on a Saturday until the deal expires.",
      "Many of the additional fixtures are expected to be schedule for Monday and Friday nights, as well as Sundays. It also includes showing multiple 2pm kick-offs on a Sunday, which will often feature clubs participating in the Europa and Conference Leagues.",
      "\"And I see, and when I travel a lot into Europe and spoke with the supporters, meeting fans, the demand is still massive. And it's going to be massive because football is the most popular sport in the world.",

But again, I'm pretty sure that the clubs are always looking for a way to make that happen, improve access, and make sure that the loyal fans get their chance to go to the stadium.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler does not fear losing his Seagulls stars, and is confident his side will continue to find solutions when their stars are sold. Carlos Baleba is the latest standout player to be linked with a move away from the Amex Stadium, with Manchester United the interested party.",
      "The Red Devils have a midfielder next on their agenda after completing a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The £74million transfer followed the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Brighton have already seen Joao Pedro depart this summer for a substantial sum and waved goodbye to the likes of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo in recent seasons. And Hurzeler, 32, is not perturbed at the prospect of that being a pattern that continues heading into the new season.",
      "While the Seagulls head coach pointed to examples of Brighton not exclusively being a selling club, the German boss' stance may provide United with some heart. There was certainly no hands off warning as Hurzeler discussed his squad.",
      "\"We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions,\" Hurzeler told the Monday Night Club. \"That's our model, we have to accept it.",
      "\"I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player.",
      "\"Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko is earning much less than fellow Premier League newcomer Viktor Gyokeres after rejecting a bigger salary elsewhere to join Manchester United.",
      "Newcastle were keen to sign the Slovenian international and even offered him a higher salary to agree terms, but Sesko opted instead to join Ruben Amorin's project at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko joined United on a five-year deal paying RB Leipzig a potential £74m - £66.4million with £7.6m in add-ons - to finally land a new centre-forward. The 22-year-old will earn around £160,000 per week, just over £8.3m a year. It means Sesko is nowhere near the top earner at Old Trafford, with Casemiro topping the pile, taking home a whopping £350,000 each week and £18.2m annually.",
      "Indeed, Sesko actually left money on the table as he agreed to work under Amorim in Manchester rather than Eddie Howe in the north east, such was his desire to join the Red Devils.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, joined Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon in July in a deal worth £64m. The Swedish striker, who formerly worked under Amorim in Portugal, had a wide range of European clubs monitoring his situation - although few took the plunge to actually negotiate a deal with Sporting - before inking a five-year deal in north London.",
      "The 27-year-old now rakes in a hefty £200,000 per week, or £10.4m a year, at Arsenal before bonuses. Only Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz earn more at the Emirates as things stand.",
      "Sesko is therefore earning £40,000 less than his fellow newcomer. However, if United make the Champions League qualifying spots this season, then the Slovenian's wages will increase to £200,000 per week, putting him on par with Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres is set to bring something that has been distinctly lacking at Arsenal in recent times - goals from a striker. While the Gunners were third in the top-scoring rankings last season, they still scored 22 fewer goals overall than they did in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The hope at the Emirates is that it will be the determining factor in winning a first title in over 20 years. Gyokeres could well be the man for the job, given that he scored a whopping 97 goals in 102 matches to help lead Sporting to two league titles during his time with the club.",
      "Discussing Gyokeres' signing and what he will bring, Arteta said: \"Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.",
      "\"He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat. We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to starting working with him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko is also promising to bring goals and assists to Man United this season. In the 2024/25 campaign, the Red Devils managed only 44 goals - a serious decline compared to their last second-placed finish in 2021/22, where they scored 73.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo already in the building at Old Trafford, Sesko joins a new-look front line that will be planning to turn United's fortunes around this season. During his short Leipzig career, the young forward scored 39 goals and assisted eight times in 87 games in all competitions.",
      "Discussing his new club, Sesko said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created.

      "Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he \"said yes\" to the opportunity to move to Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson - only for the move to never materialise.",
      "The Barcelona star has been one of Europe's elite No 9s for well over a decade, setting numerous records, but a different path may have seen him play at Old Trafford under the Scot in his final year as a manager.",
      "It was in 2012 that he gave the green light to move to Manchester from Borussia Dortmund for what would've been the final spell of Ferguson's stint in Manchester. The interest came off the back of a season where Lewandowski claimed the Bundesliga title, scoring 30 times.",
      "Dortmund though simply were not willing to sell up and that put pay to any switch. The Polish star told the BBC: \"To Manchester United I decided and said yes. I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "It means that Lewandowski has been prolific in Germany and Spain, but never England. Whilst there is a part of him that would've loved to have tried himself in the Premier League, he insists a CV that boast Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona cannot be sniffed at.",
      "He admitted: \"Maybe it could be a regret [not to play in the Premier League]. But when I am looking back [having] played for Bayern Munich, Dortmund and now Barcelona I have to say I am very happy with my career.",
      "\"I don't have this kind of feeling that I missed something, because every move or decision... I made because I wanted it.\"",
      "It was another heavyweight managerial figure in Jurgen Klopp who aided Lewandowski's development at Dortmund. The German is regarded among the best managers the club has ever had and his personal touch proved crucial in the Pole's career trajectory.",
      "He moved to the club as a youngster, not long after he'd lost his father in his teenage years, and it was until his relationship with Klopp that he found someone to help fill that void with one interaction changing his life.",
      "\"When I moved to Dortmund I was a very young guy, I lost my father when I was 16,\" he said. \"I for sure was a boy who was more closed, I didn't want to speak about my emotion. However, after a few years I met someone who I don't want to say was like a father but similar.",
      "\"Maybe after so many years the kind of conversation that I missed with my father, I had with Jurgen. I remember the conversation until now because it changed my life, it changed my football life. I put my emotion out, I put out the words I had kept in for a few years and after this I felt freedom. Maybe because of this I started to play better and better.\"",

      "Free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin would be a steal of a signing for Manchester United, if Frank Lampard's opinion is anything to go by. The Coventry City boss worked with the striker during his time in charge of Everton between 2022 and 2023.",
      "Despite the 28-year-old being blighted with injury for the majority of the season Lampard took tenure, he was left impressed with the star's capabilities. It comes as Calvert-Lewin's nine-year stint with Everton came to a close this summer, with the striker leaving the club as a free agent with 71 goals to his name from 273 appearances.",
      "But it may not take him long to find a new home. Manchester United are currently said to be showing an interest in Calvert-Lewin, as Ruben Amorim looks to further strengthen the side he inherited from Erik ten Hag in November. Calvert-Lewin is also said to be keen on the idea of signing for the club.",
      "And a transfer is good news for United fans if Lampard's gleaming opinion of the player is anything to go off. Speaking about Calvert-Lewin during his reign at Goodison Park, Lampard said: \"Dominic is a high level striker, an England striker, a Premier League regular goalscorer with all his natural attributes that we see in terms of the types of goals that he can score, his strengths, his speed, his aerial ability.",
      "\"You have to try and play to the best strengths of that without a doubt and I think also, Dominic is a forward that can connect the game and hold the ball and drop in between lines at times as well.\"",
      "He added: \"He has been great. When I say that, throughout the period of time I have been here, he has a real desire to be playing regularly and showing what he can do.",
      "\"He has done everything he can do, which can sometimes be frustrating, but has handled himself in the right way. When you take a few knocks like that, and I know it myself as a player at times, they can knock you back and you don't feel like you are contributing to the team.",
      "\"Those things are hard to handle for any player and, looking back on it, I actually think he has handled them very well to get to a place where he should enjoy his moment last week when he shows an individual performance like he did. It's now a maintenance issue of trying to keep him in that level.\"",
      "Lampard was also quick to praise Calvert-Lewin for his rise at Everton under Carlo Ancelotti between 2019 and 2021. As per the Standard, he said: \"Not everyone gets in their first team at 17 or 18, other than the Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen types of the world.",
      "\"Other players have to find different ways and now he has shown himself, last season and particularly this season, consistently he's an all-round striker. Every part of his game is a real threat.\"",
      "Amorim has already spent more than £200million this summer on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but with Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford in question, he may still want to bring in a backup striker for the fresh season. talkSPORT claims United are one of three clubs in talks with Calvert-Lewin. Hojlund has failed to live up to his price tag since signing from Atalanta in a £72m deal back in 2022, as evidenced by the fact that he scored just four Premier League goals last term.",
      "Hojlund has been told that he is free to leave the Theatre of Dreams for £30m this summer, despite the 22-year-old insisting that he hopes to fight for his place under Amorim. However, it is now reported that Hojluind is open to a move to AC Milan, with Il Rossoneri looking to secure a season-long loan deal for the Dane.",
      "Should Hojlund depart, even just on a temporary basis, then the only backups to Sesko would be Joshua Zirkzee - who managed just three goals in the Premier League last season - and an inexperienced Chido Obi. While Calvert-Lewin may not be the highest name on United fans' list of hopeful signings, the striker would undoubtedly bring a wealth of Premier League experience to Old Trafford, and given he is a free agent, the risk relating to a transfer would be at a minimum outside of the star's wages.",
      "He is also keen on the idea of playing for Manchester United next season, parting ways with his agent with hopes of finding his own way to the club in the coming weeks.",

      "Tom Heaton has revealed that he's already had to give a \"b********g\" to one of his Manchester United team-mates. Heaton, along with Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, are the three players from the old United leadership group who have been included in a new one, set up by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The goalkeeper, who turns 40 next year, signed a one-year contract with United in June and continues to be a key voice in the dressing room. The latest additions to the group are Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui. The group is a diverse mix of three players in their thirties and three in their twenties, representing four countries across three continents.",
      "The average age of this group is about 30, and it has now been revealed that the veteran shotstopper has already criticised one of his Red Devils peers.",
      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim clarified when asked about his leadership selection. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "When asked if he'd had to tell any team-mates some hard truths, Heaton, a member of the old guard, chuckled: \"Yes, but only naturally. It's not just about delivering sort of b********gs. I think it's also about supporting people who need it, trying to make sure we're guiding it and channelling it in the right way.",
      "\"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room. It provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "New member Dalot is the second-longest-serving player in the United squad behind Luke Shaw, who is now in his 12th year at the club. Shaw featured in the original eight-man group established by Erik ten Hag but managed just four appearances last season, three of which came in May.",
      "During the 2024 season, Dalot followed Ronaldo's footsteps by claiming the Players' Player of the Year award. A veteran presence in the squad, multilingual, seldom sidelined through injury and personable, it was clear why he secured the majority of his team-mates' backing.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot acknowledged. \"But I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.",
      "\"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.\"",
      "Dalot's conditioning is so legendary that he's been absent for just 13 club matches since returning to United from a season-long stint at AC Milan in 2021. An insider revealed that Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication.\"",
      "Sources have highlighted the noticeable transformation in Dalot's physique compared to his unveiling snaps in June 2018. Back then, a 19-year-old Dalot was recuperating from a meniscus injury that had him out of action for three months. Now, he employs a personal chef to whip up his meals at home.",
      "Likewise, Fernandes, who has long been part of United's leadership set-up, has been absent from just two matches due to injury in over five years, and his influence continues to be significant. In the 1-1 stalemate with Fiorentina on Saturday, for example, Fernandes encouraged Patrick Dorgu to ramp up his intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was dashing into the penalty area.",

      "Liverpool are also after defensive reinforcements, with Marc Guehi looking like the most likely addition. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish indicated the Eagles may be forced to sell, and the Premier League champions may come back in for the England star after having bids rejected.",

      "The Congolese striker is set to join from Brentford in a deal worth a reported £35m.",

      "Manchester United have seen a player-plus cash bid for Carlos Baleba knocked back, according to the Sun, with the paper also suggesting Gianluigi Donnarumma's omission from Paris Saint-Germain's Super Cup squad could be the precursor to a move.",
      "Baleba might end up being out of United's price range this summer unless they can bring in fees for out-of-favour stars.",

      "So prepare to get irrationally angry at the merest perceived slight against your Premier League team, because it's all good practice for the next nine months isn't it? And accept no imitations, because the original and best kit rankings are BACK.",

      "Top affordable kids' football boots for summer: Adidas, Nike and more on sale",
      "My eyes! The goggles do nothing! Yeah the retro badge is nice, albeit a little out of step with the modern adidas logo (come on give us more trefoils lads) but overall this looks like there's been a terrible collision between a lorry full of radioactive waste and a factory full of Fulham home shirts.",
      "European champions in 1982, Villa seemed to have enjoyed last season's foray into the Champions League so much that they've kept the retro feel going with this number which is more suited to black and white television than glorious HD. Dull.",
      "Putting aside the annual question about just how useful a Wolves away kit is anyway, if you think you've seen this one before you're almost right. It's pretty much an exact replica of last season's goalkeeper kit only with the badge moved to the side. It's also just a goalkeeper kit colour isn't it? You can't fool us, Sudu.",
      "It's another one for the keeper kit files from Newcastle, who by the way are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, just in case this kit wasn't making that clear enough.",
      "If you happened to catch the Club World Cup then a) sorry about that, and b) this kit won't feel all that new to you. But whether is seen in the west London drizzle or next to the orange glow of Donald Trump it is still pretty dull.",
      "Sadly Brentford have ditched their policy of keeping at least one of their shirts from the previous season to ease the financial burden on their fans. It's a shame, but everyone gouges everyone else these days so it's understandable. It's just unfortunate they've produced this quite forgettable home kit as a result.",
      "It's, er, yeah. Look there are a lot of these and it's hard to find something to say about ALL of them, okay?",
      "This is a familiar problem for Brighton, and one we seem to touch on every year. Because you are absolutely certain you've seen them wear this kit before aren't you? Like, positive. And surely they have, haven't they? Nice little detail on the inside of the neck though just in case you'd forgotten.",
      "They don't seem as scary as they used to be these days, but if they were then we'd describe this away kit as 'ominous' or 'business-like' or something. But instead it's just fairly non-descript.",
      "Long term readers of these yearly events - hi mum - will know that we are absolutely not sticklers for consistency, but every so often we'll do something sensible just to keep you on your toes. So yeah Spurs away is just above City's.",
      "Not quite sure why this isn't really hitting the heights. It could be that it's quite similar to last season's, or maybe the weirdness of the sleeves. Dunno.",
      "The badge is good. The brown and gold though? Not quite. When it was released the club announced that the shirt 'celebrates our special relationship with the bee'. Which is quite a funny thing to say isn't it.",
      "Like a Saturday night in certain east London establishments, there is claret everywhere. There's not much blue for the Hammers this season, with those little bits under the sleeves and on the collar not quite cutting it.",
      "We can already feel that this won't go down well, but while it's a perfectly fine shirt it's not really that different from previous ones is it? Also, stop trying to get us to go to Rwanda please Arsenal.",
      "Back in the big time again, Burnley return with this effort that like West Ham is much more claret than it is blue. It's a slightly more pleasing shade of claret though, which is why they're higher. Honest.",
      "Still sporting the funniest of the random gambling company sponsors are Bournemouth, who have added a dash of gold to their usual red and white stripe offering this time around. Yep, we're in the realm of 'it's fine' now.",
      "There's not an awful lot going on here, but at least there's the piping down the sides and on the sleeves which elevate it somewhat. Like Fulham themselves, inoffensive.",
      "See, consistency again. Don't say we don't listen to you. Manchester United's away kit has a little bit more going for it than the Fulham home one though, with the jazzy pattern on the front.",
      "The only middle badge on an away kit this season, and one of only three in our 40, this does look a little bit like a cyclops from far away. The colours are different though, and that is to be applauded in a season of sameyness.",
      "It's another that falls into the category of kits you think they've worn before, but there's a subtle drop in the neck which is a nice touch and elevates this somewhat. You'd better buy it or more dinnerladies might get sacked.",
      "There's a dash of blue here which makes the black and white stripes pop somewhat, and Newcastle have also gone with what we think we'd all describe as a 'traditional' stripe width, which is always comforting to see.",
      "Burnley will be resembling a lovely blue sky on their travels this season, and the drop on the collar gives this a nice look too. Yeah we're into the bit where they're basically all just as nice as each other now.",
      "It's a Leeds away shirt that puts you in mind of Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Rio Ferdinand.... Peter Ridsdale... expensive goldfish bowls and, er, getting relegated. Sure it'll all be fine this time around though.",
      "Different? Yeah. In a good way? Hmmm. Arsenal are reminding us of some of their dreariest teams of the 1990s with their change strip which 'features a fresh take on the iconic lightning bolt design which has become synonymous with our away kits' if they say so themselves.",
      "We all know that needs must when it comes to sponsorship, but it's a shame that the Bulls are Red here because they do kind of draw your attention away from the rest of the kit.",
      "Maybe the wavy lines are a reference to the water down by their new stadium on Liverpool's docks, but they're a nice touch here. They also give a darker look to Everton's traditional royal blue that makes this shirt pop a bit more.",
      "It was so nearly there but the red shield around the Liver bird crest probably wasn't really needed, and the black on the collar and sleeves could maybe just do with being red as well. Nice though.",
      "You've got to be brave to pull off the middle badge but Spurs have done it here, even if, as with Leeds, your eyes are rather drawn to the big red sponsor before anything else. Which of course is exactly what the sponsor wants. Good sponsoring, AIA.",
      "Also going straight down the middle are Sunderland, who return to the big time rocking the Hummel chevrons, which are always a welcome addition to any shirt even if they get a little bit lost among the stripes here.",
      "The sash. It's bold, it's different, and it can look very good when it's done well. And that's exactly what Manchester City and Puma have done here with a streak across the front of a kit that screams style. Maybe. Look we're into top 10 now, almost there.",
      "Who knows what on earth is going on with Chelsea's shirt sponsorship these days, but until they get one plastered on the front of this shirt just enjoy those unsullied stripes while you can. This could be worn by Morocco at a World Cup, and that's absolutely a good thing.",
      "Collars can make or break football kits, and Wolves have called this one just right. Any bigger and we'd have been in danger of veering towards the 1970s, but it works perfectly on a shirt which is a pleasing shade of the old gold.",
      "Rocking a somewhat newer gold are Crystal Palace, but we'll let them get away with that after last season's successes. It's a departure from the norm in terms of their away kit colours, but as ever with Palace it's a good-looking one.",
      "Meanwhile there's a strong 80s feel to the Palace home shirt, which also looks a little bit like a shirt a fictional football team might wear as well. Not sure why. The white outlines make the red and blue really stand out, and it's a bold look for a club making strides in stripes.",
      "Not that you ever would obviously, but you *could* wear this on a night out couldn't you? It's a soft, stylish look on the road for Forest this season with the adidas detailing and colouring making it stand out from similar efforts on this list.",
      "This is another one that you could wear out if you were that way inclined - although we are in no way encouraging you to be, just to make that clear. The collar and the sleeves are nice, and there's a fresh look to the shirt which works well.",
      "Liverpool and Adidas are back together, and it just looks right. The reigning champions will turn out in this excellent home number which could only be improved if it featured the original trefoil not the newer logo, but you knew that already didn't you.",
      "All hail the Hummel chevrons and their place on the Sunderland away kit, which blends together the retro badge with a retro kit in a way that others have failed this season. The Roker lighthouse is woven into the fabric too, making it easy to see why this shirt has been such a winner with the Mackems.",
      "It's a scrappy underdog, and judging by past experience this is probably going to be the most controversial placing on this list, but we're happy with our choice. Bournemouth's away kit is smooth, sleek and, yeah we're gonna say it, sexy. The Cherries are going to pop in this.",
      "Yep, it's the pinstripes again. They are a long-term favourite on these lists, and Nottingham Forest have pulled them off perfectly for a home shirt which has strong early 90s vibes. Granted, Forest got relegated back then, but as they prepare for a season in the C̴o̴n̴f̴e̴r̴e̴n̴c̴e̴ ̴L̴e̴a̴g̴u̴e̴ Europa League such concerns should be far away in this."

      "Manchester United supporters group The 1958 has pulled the plug on a planned protest. The group had planned to march against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership ahead of United's opening Premier League game, against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Their decision comes just days after Benjamin Sesko joined the club. Slovenia striker Sesko has arrived in a deal worth up to £74million, bringing United's summer spending above £200m following te earlier arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "In early August, The 1958 shared plans for a protest while claiming \"shiny new signings\" shouldn't distract from minority owner Ratcliffe's involvement. However, following a mixed response to the announcement, the group then put the plans to its membership.",
      "While the majority of those surveyed agreed Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS should be judged on what they have delivered, some 68 percent felt they deserved more time to show what they can do. In announcing the postponement of the march, The 1958 published a breakdown of the voting.",
      "\"For us, it has always been, and will always be, about the fans,\" the group said in a statement. \"About how we’re treated by the club and its owners. About protecting the future of Manchester United, affordable football for all (especially youth), safeguarding fan culture, and ensuring the next generation of supporters inherit a club run with responsibility and respect.\"",
      "The statement continued: \"These long-term goals matter more to us than signings, glittery training ground refurbs or anything else. That’s where we’ve always stood and we make no apologies for it.",
      "\"With a fanbase as diverse and passionate as ours, finding the right balance isn’t always easy. We’ve had to consider momentum, timing, fan appetite, broader consequences of protest activity whilst assessing how current and future decisions may impact us as fans.",
      "\"Given the current sentiment within the fanbase and particularly in light of these recent survey results, it’s clear there is no unified view on the direction of the club under Ratcliffe. That split is real, and we believe it would be irresponsible to risk creating a situation that could result in any “red on red” conflict inside or outside the stadium.\"",
      "New striker Sesko has spoken for the first time about his hopes as a United player. \"[My ambitions are] just that we get better, that we connect together, in general, and we, as a team, just try to grow, to grow together step by step because we're getting better,\" he said. \"We're just even more complete and complete. It's just a matter of time when we can fly high again.\"",
      "When asked about his reasons for joining United, he said: \"I think, first of all, because of the club. It's just a historical club that is unbelievable.",

      "Manchester United have not been shy in spending big to enhance their frontline with goals a major problem for Ruben Amorim throughout last season.",
      "On Saturday the club announced the £70million capture of Benjamin Sesko, who will lead their line. The former RB Leipzig striker is regarded among the finest young forwards in Europe and could form part of a new look front three.",
      "Matheus Cunha was Amorim's first summer signing, joining from Wolves, and then after weeks of negotiations Bryan Mbeumo signed from Brentford. Both of them have been embedding themselves into Amorim's system over their pre-season games.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are also proven Premier League performers and scored more than 30 goals between them last term with Sesko poised to spearhead an attack alongside them.",
      "That is the attack, which massively misfired last term, all but sorted and attention will turn to further down the pitch. There's no getting round the fact that United have a huge gap to bridge to the European spots, let alone the Champions League places.",
      "The name most heavily linked with a move to Manchester over the past week has been Carlos Baleba at Brighton. Contact was made through intermediaries to see whether a deal could be struck, albeit that is massively impacted on the budget that remains at Old Trafford.",
      "Baleba is the latest in a long time of quality players to have seen their stock skyrocket at Brighton and the Seagulls could command a huge profit on their Cameroon midfielder. United's next target is to land a No 6 type midfielder, leading to their interest in Baleba.",
      "If any deal is to be struck it may require those in Manchester to get creative with their negotiations, potentially including a swap if they want to tempt Brighton. Baleba would provide huge energy as part of a two-man midfield, likely alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Doubts remain - for varying reasons - over the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro with Amorim yet to totally be convinced by either player.",
      "Another man that has not totally sold himself yet to the United boss is goalkeeper Andre Onana. He was dropped for a match last season after some notable errors in a Europa League draw at Lyon. He was later bought back into the fold, but his error count has been a concern throughout.",
      "Bringing in a new No 1 was not a priority this summer, but after United were able to iron out their attacking recruitment before the season starts they may see if there's scope and budget to make moves in between the sticks.",
      "The two names most heavily linked are Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma at PSG. The latter appears more likely, even though he just played a leading role in the French side becoming European champions. His signing would obviously be a huge coup for United.",
      "PSG have just signed a new goalkeeper from Lille and Donnarumma's contract is winding down. There is an openness from both parties to consider going their separate ways, but only for a fair fee. Whatever it is, the Italian would be one of the most heavyweight No 1s to join the Premier League in years.",
      "United's improvements this summer and set to receive one of their sternest tests on Sunday when they host Arsenal at Old Trafford, where a number of new faces have the chance to make an immediate impression.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo put pen to paper on moves from Wolves and Brentford earlier this year. The pair have been followed by striker Benjamin Sesko, who completed a big-money switch from German side RB Leipzig.",
      "The Red Devils might not be totally finished there either. A new midfielder is potentially on their shortlist before next month’s deadline amid links with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Away from incomings, United also need to focus on sales. Marcus Rashford has already departed and could be followed out of the door by Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and more.",
      "With that being said, take a look at all of the latest transfer news and rumours from Old Trafford…",
      "Man United have been told to get a move on in their bid to sign Brighton’s Baleba - or risk Real Madrid hijacking a switch. Speaking to talkSPORT, Troy Deeney said: “I think United have to get Baleba this window, or they don’t get him.",
      "“If he has another good season, I do think other teams with Real Madrid and the like will come in and go ‘Bosh, we’ll have him’.",
      "“I think if Man United want him…if I’m Ruben Amorim I’m kind of bullish on that. I’d be saying ‘get this deal done because then I can get you into Europe’. If they can sign him, he can move them up 10 spaces [in the Premier League].”",
      "Barcelona chief Joan Laporta has admitted that Marcus Rashford might NOT be registered in time for the new season following his loan switch to Catalonia. “We’re working to make it happen,\" he said.",
      "“With Marc’s decision, we have the option of registering Joan Garcia, and we’re working on the rest. This week we’ll have news, hopefully good news, to see if we can register them before La Liga starts. And if we can’t, we have time.”",
      "Barcelona have until the end of August to sort the issue out - albeit Rashford could miss the start of the new La Liga campaign.",
      "Sticking with Barcelona, reported United target Fermin Lopez has said he has no intention of leaving the club any time soon. He said: \"I want to stay here. It’s my dream and I will stay, I’m happy to help the team. Many things have been said.",
      "\"But I am going to continue defending these colours and working as hard as anyone else, so that the Catalans are calm.”",
      "Recent reports have claimed that United were considering a £61m offer for the midfielder.",

      "Manchester United believe that personal terms with Carlos Baleba will not be an issue with the player keen on the move - but it remains to be seen whether Brighton are open to selling.",
      "Last week those at Old Trafford made contact via intermediaries to gauge whether they could strike a deal for the Cameroon midfielder, who produced an impressive season at the Seagulls and is now attracting a number of admiring glances.",
      "Baleba is likely to cost around £100million - which is just shy of the figure Brighton demanded before they agreed to sell Moises Caicedo to Chelsea two summers ago.",
      "United do not currently have those kinds of sums and from the minute they expressed their interest there was an acceptance that securing the deal would be a huge challenge. They've spent more than £200m to sign the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reports that those in Manchester will still attempt to pursue a deal but know that they may miss out. After landing Sesko's signing on Saturday Ruben Amorim's priority now is on adding a midfielder.",
      "Brighton have already sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea, banking up to £60m, and will be loathed to lose another of their major players whilst there is less need for them to cash in. Their chief executive Paul Barber has played down speculation that the Red Devils have even been in contact and underlined the fact that the Seagulls have no interest in selling more of their top players.",
      "He said: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",

      "Back in Bilbao's San Mames stadium, Tottenham ended their 17-year trophy drought with a 1-0 victory, courtesy of a fortuitous Brennan Johnson goal. Bale, who won the PFA Player of the Year twice while at Spurs, was on punditry duty and couldn't resist a dig at United's expense.",
      "Commenting on Tottenham's social media post poking fun at the term 'Spursy' - often used to describe their historical tendency to falter in big games - Bale flipped the script. \"It could be a Unitedy thing now, I'm telling you!\" he quipped with a grin, suggesting the Red Devils had inherited the unwanted label of underperforming in crucial moments.",
      "The remark left Ferdinand, a United icon, squirming. \"Can we get off air now?\" he reportedly muttered, clearly unimpressed by Bale's jab.",
      "The broadcaster officially announced Bale's appointment on Monday, along with four other newcomers: ex-West Ham star Michail Antonio, former Lionesses Fara Williams and Anita Asante, and ex-Scotland women's ace Jen Beattie.",
      "Bale sticks out as the cream of the crop, with the five-time Champions League-winning Welshman able to bring his global football pedigree to the studio. His illustrious career - which included a legendary eight-year spell at Real Madrid, two stints at Tottenham and a pivotal role in leading Wales to the 2016 Euros semi-finals - gives him unmatched credibility.",
      "Unlike Ferdinand, whose analysis often leaned on his defensive expertise and United-centric perspective, Bale offers a broader lens, shaped by his experiences across top clubs and different countries. His playful jab at United showed he's unafraid to stir the pot, a trait that could make him a fan favourite in the studio.",
      "Tottenham's victory and Bale's subsequent commentary also highlighted his enduring connection to the club. He praised then-manager Ange Postecoglou's tactics, crediting the Australian for delivering a trophy despite a shaky Premier League campaign.",
      "Ferdinand has been one of their most recognisable faces on TNT during Premier League, Champions League and Europa League matches and has been an ever-present since joining in 2015 under the channel's previous name BT Sport.",
      "The 46-year-old said he wanted to experience a new chapter and focus on his own YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand Presents, as well as his other business interests.",

      "Harry Maguire has lifted the lid on the excitement surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning Manchester United return, admitting his disappointment in how things ultimately ended.",
      "Ronaldo made a name for himself at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2003 and 2009, before securing a then-world record transfer of £80million to Real Madrid.",
      "The forward continued to excel with Los Blancos, scooping two La Liga titles, four domestic trophies, four Champions Leagues and four of his five total Ballon d'Ors before moving on to Juventus in 2018.",
      "United fans were delighted to hear that Ronaldo was returning to Old Trafford three years later, but his last dance with the Red Devils didn't quite go as planned. While the now 40-year-old managed 18 Premier League goals under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick in 2021/22 as United finished sixth in the table, he reportedly grew dissatisfied with United's team performances.",
      "After falling out of favour under new head coach Erik ten Hag, Ronaldo revealed all in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan, which led to Manchester United mutually terminating his contract in November 2022.",
      "Maguire admits that Ronaldo's return was a breath of fresh air in the dressing room for his team-mates, despite the ending leaving a bitter taste in the mouth.",
      "Speaking with Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the centre-half who has been with United since 2019, said: \"I can't speak a bad word about him. It was amazing to have him, when he walked through the door it was just incredible.",
      "\"It was just so disappointing how it ended and how we couldn't find a way to perform with him in the team. He was performing, he was scoring goals, it was crazy. I don't know how many he scored that year. We were rubbish and he was still scoring goals, so it just shows how good he is.",
      "\"But we just couldn't find a way to... all our system under Ole was about being on the front foot, being aggressive. Pressing, it was like a pressing machine. We weren't the best team, we actually finished third and then second. We probably didn't have the best players.",
      "\"We had some great players, don't get me wrong, but it was all about pressing and working to a tactic and working to a shape, and when to jump and when to stay. And obviously Cristiano came in and we just didn't adapt well enough for him, and you could just tell he was so upset and frustrated.\"",
      "With regards to how he dealt with the process of losing Ronaldo as a senior player, he added: \"We just couldn't believe what happened because we obviously finished third, then second, and then that season we brought in Sanch [Jadon Sancho], Rafa [Raphael Varane] and Cristiano in the summer.",
      "\"And you're thinking, 'Here we go now, like, let's go win the Premier League,' and it just never happened. It just never clicked. And obviously we lost Ole, which was disappointing if I'm being honest. I feel like Ole did an unbelievable job, I'll probably speak more about Ole when I'm retired.",
      "\"But the way that he set us up in the first two years is probably the best I've felt in a team, under Ole and Kieran [McKenna] and Carras [Michael Carrick]. Those three, they had us so well organised. And like I said, we didn't have the best team about. We were just well-coached, tactically brilliant.",
      "\"We could play, we could press. The third season I was there it just didn't work, and it had nothing to do with Cristiano because like I said, he was our best player that year by far. The boys and the tactics around him, it just didn't work.\"",
      "Manchester United are currently gearing up for their return to the Premier League under new boss, Ruben Amorim, who took the reins following the sacking of Ten Hag in October. The Portuguese tactician endured a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the standings last term, but will hope to perform to the best of his abilities with a full summer transfer window and pre-season under the belt.",
      "Amorim has been incredibly active in the current window, recruiting the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to the ranks. Fans will see if a revamped squad will pay off come Sunday, August 17, when United face Arsenal under the bright lights of the Theatre of Dreams.",

      "Argentinian born Rodriguez has previously posted images of a ring, but neither had officially confirmed a proposal. Ronaldo, who has recently celebrated his 40th birthday had previously admitted that he hadn't asked for her hand in marriage because the timing isn't 'quite right'.",
      "He said: \"I always tell her: 'When we get that click. Like everything with our life, and she knows what I'm talking about. It could be in a year or it could be in six months or it could be in a month. I'm 1000% sure that it'll happen.\"",

      "Despite not officially confirming their marriage, Ronaldo has often referred to Georgina as his 'wife'. In December, at the 2024 Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, he said: \"It’s a big pleasure to win this trophy. My oldest son is here, my wife [Georgina] is here.\"",
      "Earlier this year, when celebrating her birthday, Ronaldo posted on social media: : \"For the mother, partner, friend, my wife... happy birthday, love. Your light illuminates us and your love infects us.\"",
      "The couple met at a Gucci store in 2016, with the ex-Manchester United superstar admitting that it was a case of love at first sight. \"She's a fantastic person. Yes, it is [true love]. Yes, it was [like magic meeting for the first time]. Gio is part of me. She helps me so much.,\" he told  Piers Morgan in an interview in 2019.",

[She's the greatest love of my life]... Why not [get married]. Not now! Not in this interview. Why not, one day... We'll one day, for sure. It's my mum's dream.\"",
      "Since linking up, Ronaldo has moved from Real Madrid to Juventus, before his sensational return to the Premier League with Manchester United. But his incredible reunion ended on a sour note after falling out with manager Erik ten Hag leading to his contract being terminated prematurely.",
      "He then became the first global superstar to move to Saudi Arabia when he signed a huge contract with Al Nassr in 2023. There had been speculation that he could leave the club this summer, before signing another huge extension, despite being in his 40s.",
      "Ronaldo has admitted that his legendary career is now into it's final stages, suggesting retirement will be on the cards in the next few years. Speaking in June, he said: \"My mentality is to live day by day. I don't have many more years to play…but I'm enjoying the moment.",

      "His situation could now open the door for those on the red side of Manchester. PSG expect to receive an offer from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, according to ESPN. The trio of European giants have been in touch with Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "United have already spent in excess of £200million this summer - landing the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo. The Red Devils ambitions have been on replenishing their forward line thus far in the transfer window, but attention may now turn to other areas.",
      "Questions have been asked about Andre Onana for much of his time at Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim dropped the Cameroon goalkeeper for a match at Newcastle last season after he made several errors during a Europa League game.",
      "Onana has made it clear he wants to prove himself in Manchester and funds may prove the biggest issue for Amorim and co if Donnarumma does try and make a move this summer. The United boss has expressed no desire to change his No 1 at present.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has endured a torrid start to life at Barcelona after producing what some are calling \"the miss of the season\". The Manchester United loanee netted his first goal for the club during their commanding 5-0 pre-season win against Daegu last week - but any positive momentum was quickly erased in Sunday's equally commanding 5-0 victory over Como, where he shockingly failed to score from just eight yards out with an open goal gaping.",
      "Following a clever through ball from Lamine Yamal, Rashford neatly jinked past the goalkeeper and a defender to leave himself with an easy finish. But instead of scoring, his left-footed shot agonizingly missed the target, rolling inches wide of the post. He was substituted a few minutes later.",
      "With Robert Lewandowski sidelined due to injury, Rashford has a golden chance to convince manager Hansi Flick that he is more than just a squad player. However, his glaring miss versus Como sparked major doubts about his quality, confidence, and suitability for the No. 9 position.",
      "Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo declared that \"it is clear he [Rashford] is not a natural No. 9.\" Meanwhile, AS went further, criticising his \"strange performance\" filled with \"notable errors in execution, especially in his attempt to provide continuity in the play with his back to goal.\"",
      "On the Spanish radio show El Larguero, commentator Jordi Marti said Rashford \"left me cold,\" expressing frustration: \"The expectations I had of him in that No. 9 position have left me cold. But I've seen him do better on the wing; when he takes on the ball, he does so with power and accurate assists.\"",
      "\"But today was an important day for him. Lewandowski will be out for the next few weeks, and these are the games he needs to take advantage of.\"",
      "After falling out with United manager Ruben Amorim, Rashford - who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa - made it clear he wanted to leave the club this summer, with Barcelona his top choice.",
      "The Catalan side initially targeted Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, but after those deals collapsed, they shifted their focus to Rashford. A loan agreement was quickly sealed, including a £30million option for Barcelona to sign the 27-year-old permanently next summer.",
      "Rashford's versatility played a significant role in the transfer, with Flick valuing his capacity to perform both as a striker and winger. However, he may have to wait before officially debuting, as Barcelona have yet to register him.",
      "The registration holdups stem from La Liga's Financial Fair Play rules, which consistently challenge the Catalan club. To add new players and extend contracts, Barcelona need to free up enough salary space.",
      "A breakthrough came when the issue involving Marc-Andre ter Stegen was resolved. His back injury and initial refusal to certify a long-term absence complicated the registration of new goalkeeper Joan Garcia. Ter Stegen's recent consent to sign a medical document has now paved the way for Garcia's registration, but Rashford's paperwork is still pending.",
      "Barcelona have until the end of August to finalise player registrations for the upcoming campaign. This means Rashford could still be included in the squad after the La Liga opener against Mallorca this weekend, even if he doesn’t play immediately.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "An unnamed Manchester United player has already had a \"b********g\" from Tom Heaton.",
      "\"Yes, but only naturally,\" Heaton laughed. \"It's not just about delivering sort of b********gs as you put it. I think it's also about supporting people that need it, trying to make sure we're guiding it and channelling it in the right way.\"",
      "Heaton, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the three players part of the old United leadership group who are in the new one, revived by Ruben Amorim. Heaton, 40 next year, signed a one-year deal with United in June and remains one of the most prominent voices in the dressing room.",
      "The newest members are Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui. It is a diverse blend of three 30-somethings and three players in their twenties, with four countries and three continents represented. The average age is just over 30.",
      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim explained. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "Heaton has a 14-year association with United through two separate stints and rejoined his boyhood club in 2021. \"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room,\" Heaton explained, \"it provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Dalot is the second-longest serving member of the United squad after Luke Shaw, into his 12th year at the club. Shaw was a member of the octet established by Erik ten Hag but started four games last season, three of them in May.",
      "The MEN revealed last season Amorim gravitated towards Dalot and Fernandes. A natural development, given their shared nationality. Dalot is also fluent in four languages, which makes him one of the most approachable members of the squad.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo mentioned Dalot and Martinez among three teammates he admired at United in 2022. Casemiro, the third, was also added to the original leadership group by Ten Hag.",
      "In 2024, Dalot emulated Ronaldo by becoming the United players' player of the year. A senior statesman of the squad, a polyglot, rarely injured and affable, it was easy to see why he got most teammates' vote.",
      "Dalot had his squad number upgraded to '2' by Amorim in the summer and he captained United in the second half of their goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm last month. The irony is he is no longer a certain starter, with Amad the favoured option on the right wing to collaborate with Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Only one of the leadership group could feasibly start against Arsenal on Sunday - Fernandes. It is unlikely to cow the others in the dressing room.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot accepts, \"but I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.\"",
      "Dalot is close to Ronaldo and had Raphael Varane and Casemiro within earshot during United's successful 2022-23 season, three serial winners to look up to. His fitness is so renowned he has missed only 13 club games since he returned to United from a season-long loan at AC Milan in 2021.",
      "A source said Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication\". Dalot wears leg compressors on long-haul flights to reduce any muscle soreness and maximise circulation.",
      "Sources have pointed out how much leaner and chiselled Dalot now looks in contrast to his unveiling pictures in June 2018. Dalot, 19 at the time, was recovering from a meniscus injury that kept him sidelined for three months but he had a cherub face. Now he employs a private chef to prepare his meals at home.",
      "Fernandes has only ever missed two United games through injury in five-and-a-half years. \"He has the highest pain threshold I have ever encountered,\" a Carrington source said.",
      "His influence remains profound. As recently as the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Saturday, Fernandes urged Patrick Dorgu to show more intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was sprinting into the penalty area.",
      "Amorim included Mazraoui - signed by Ten Hag - as \"he's a character that I like\". Mazraoui played in seven different positions last season and was rested for only two games.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee enthused about how motivational a presence Martinez, sidelined since February 2 with a knee injury, has been in the treatment room. Martinez captained United in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce last year.",
      "Maguire, stripped of the captaincy by Ten Hag in July 2023, pulled the armband back on for the first time under Amorim during the 4-0 thrashing of Everton on December 1. Maguire's form over the past two seasons, having seen a £30million transfer to West Ham United collapse, is testament to his resolve. He is now one of a handful of respectable signings in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "United opened the doors to their renovated Carrington hub on Friday. Heaton, a veteran of training days at Lyttleton Road and The Cliff as a schoolboy, described the launch as \"a moment in the club. Especially for us as players, we're in it all the time. So I think we can use that to go again and build and move it forward and making sure that all the lads are aligned with that.\"",
      "Dalot is not as demonstrative as his compatriot Fernandes but is emboldened to pull players in line. \"Of course, otherwise we couldn't be in that group,\" he said. \"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.",
      "\"I think that's the only way to go to where we want to go.\"",
      "Expect a few more b********gs.",

      "With Benjamin Sesko signed, Manchester United can finally switch their focus to other areas of the squad in need of investment.",
      "The Slovenia international finalised his £66.4million move to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig on Saturday, becoming United's fourth signing of the summer and their third in the attacking department.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier this summer, the addition of an out-and-out centre-forward remained United's leading priority ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning they were left with no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer. Between them, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko scored 58 goals for their former clubs last season.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have sourced two players with impressive Premier League records. They have scored 71 career goals in the division between them, plundering 35 of them last season.",
      "Sesko, of course, has arrived from overseas, meaning there is more of a risk attached, but he should benefit from operating alongside two players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United have often turned to the overseas market for new additions in recent years, regularly taking one too many gambles. The additions of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony, for example, rank as two of the worst signings in United's history when you consider their price tags.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to be a success at any level of the game, but there is a lot less risk attached when recruiting a player that knows the league.",
      "Having not seen the best version of Manuel Ugarte all that often in the last 12 months, United are hoping to add a midfielder to their ranks before the window closes. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba has emerged as a target and he would be a terrific signing for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite only being 21, the Cameroonian, who joined Brighton from Lille two years ago, has become one of the Premier League's most highly-rated midfielders. The latest hidden talent to be discovered by the Seagulls, Baleba is capable of doing a little bit of everything in midfield.",
      "Renowned for his energy, his ball-carrying expertise, his passing range and his hunger to win the ball back, he ticks a lot of boxes for United. The Reds currently lack a midfielder that can do a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Ugarte was drafted in last summer to provide some defensive nous and bite, but it has become clear he is limited when in possession. He struggles to progress the ball in the way United need him to.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is an excellent operator with enormous amounts of potential, but his long-term position under Amorim is yet to be nailed down. Furthermore, he is a forward-thinking player and lacks the defensive ability to play next to Bruno Fernandes in a midfield duo.",
      "Casemiro is past his best and struggled last season to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League, reserving his best performances for the Europa League. He also has less than a year remaining on his contract and should be sold if a new midfielder arrives.",
      "Baleba, on the other hand, is up and coming. He has demonstrated he has what it takes to consistently make his mark in the Premier League and United do lack a midfielder of his profile.",
      "Of course, it has been well-documented Baleba will not come cheap, but United are well aware of that. Brighton will dig their heels in to try and secure as high a fee as possible.",
      "Despite only being 21, Baleba has only played 21 Premier League games fewer than Cunha, racking up 61 top flight appearances in England over the last two seasons.",
      "United often turned to the Premier League's best talent during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday. After signing Cunha and Mbeumo from domestic rivals already this summer, United would be wise to do the same again to solve their next transfer objective.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "If Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Fiorentina on Saturday confirmed anything, it was that Rasmus Hojlund will not be starting Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dane was left out of the starting line-up for the second game running, with Amorim choosing to deploy Mason Mount up front instead.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, Sesko is expected to be thrown straight into the starting XI this weekend and lead United's attack. He should be supported by fellow new recruits Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha, who occupied the two playmaker roles at the weekend.",
      "Following the penalty shootout triumph over Fiorentina, Amorim admitted he has an \"idea\" of what his starting XI will look like for the Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners. However, he did concede that his players could still alter his plans.",
      "When asked about having a selection headache, Amorim told MUTV: \"That is a good thing, it's supposed to be like that, not like last season when we had to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is a normal thing, so I have to think and they need to fight during the week so they can change my mind. I have one idea, but they can change my mind during the week.\"",
      "With five days to go until the clash with Arsenal, United fans are beginning to share predictions and their opinions on what the starting XI should look like. Many of their predicted XIs have similar looks and it is unlikely their submissions will be far from the XI that is revealed at 3.15pm on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Factoring in how pre-season unfolded and how the landscape of the squad currently looks, it can be argued that eight starters are guaranteed: Andre Onana (expected to be back fit), Leny Yoro, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko.",
      "However, there is a debate to be had about who will start in the centre and on the left of the defence and alongside Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven started against Fiorentina and Casemiro got the nod in the engine room next to Fernandes. The latter's performance reminded United of why they are still in need of a midfielder.",
      "Yoro is the only centre-back guaranteed to start against the Gunners after making four starts in a row in pre-season and producing some really promising performances, particularly in the United States. De Ligt bagged three starts, likewise Luke Shaw, but Maguire and Heaven only started twice.",
      "Maguire and De Ligt are competing to start in the middle of the defence and that battle was always likely to be decided by pre-season performances. Heaven has made rapid progress since joining United and is an exciting option for the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw is also in the conversation to start.",
      "The other selection dilemma facing Amorim is who should start in midfield next to Fernandes. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are competing for that spot and the latter earned three starts in pre-season.",
      "However, he showed last season he struggles to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. Ugarte is a solid midfield destroyer, capable of winning the ball back, but he is limited in possession.",
      "Mainoo has talent Amorim needs to tap into, but the prospect of him and Fernandes starting next to each other in midfield risks leaving United exposed in the centre of the pitch.",
      "With eight starters looking nailed on, three places remain up for grabs.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The shirt is predominantly black with a yellow and blue trim. The trim features around the collar, on the shoulders and on the sleeve cuffs.",
      "It is inspired by the famous away kit worn by United between 1993 and 1995, including when the club won the Double for the first time in 1993/94.",
      "The Snapdragon logo, just as it is on the home and away shirts that were revealed earlier this summer, is again front and centre on the shirt. Qualcomm Technologies has a £60million a season sponsorship deal with the club and had their brand Snapdragon on the front of shirts for the first time last term.",
      "The shirt also features adidas' iconic Trefoil logo in yellow and the United crest is positioned inside a shield.",
      "Reimagining one of the most storied kits in the club's history, the design focuses on the details, from the engineered devil-base fabric to the authentic three-stripe tape and flat-knit crew collar and cuffs.After last season's celebrated reintroduction of the adidas Trefoil logo on their third shirt, United have said 'its return honours the logo's historic legacy in the sport, as well as acknowledging the rising role of fashion in today's game'.",
      "United's players donned the new away kit in their opening two pre-season friendlies of the summer before wearing their new home strip for the win over Bournemouth and the draws against Everton and Fiorentina.",

      "Off the pitch, it has been a hectic time for Ineos and transfer decision-makers. So far, deals have been completed for Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, despite that huge outlay on three big-name attacking additions, there could be further movement - on the proviso United can sanction one or two sales. Meanwhile, there continues to be plenty of talk around Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnaco are, meanwhile, effectively on the transfer list.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "Despite Brighton's stance that Baleba is not for sale this summer, their manager Fabian Hurzeler has insisted that he is not fearful of losing their better players in the transfer window.",
      "Brighton have already lost the likes of Joao Pedro in this window.",
      "He told the Monday Night Club:",
      "We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions. That's our model, we have to accept it. I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player. Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us.",
      "So much focus has been on attacking quarters this summer that very few names have done the rounds in other positions. Although the Bayern Munich man is a fine player in his own right, surely United are stocked-up at the back? One to keep an eye on, even if it seems fanciful at this stage;",
      "So there we have it. Benjamin Sesko is expected to wear No.30 for United this season. Diego Leon has seemingly shifted to No.35 - despite only just taking No.30 himself - in a late U-turn from the decision-makers. Perhaps it was part of a deal for Sesko?

      "It's said that Chelsea are not inclined to simply meet the Reds' valuation. Garnacho reportedly expects to join the west Londoners before the summer transfer window slams shut on September 1, and he's ruled out all options other than moving to Stamford Bridge or staying at Old Trafford.",

      "The report claims that United believe Baleba is keen on a transfer, and personal terms aren't thought to be an issue. It's said that it will be 'very difficult' to sign the 21-year-old from the Seagulls, but Jason Wilcox will try'.",

      "Omari Hutchinson appears to be gaining plenty of interest including from Nottingham Forest.",

      "I want it as much as the club wants it. I've said this about other transfers as well. A player's decision to come to Turkey is crucial. We don't have the luxury of buying every player we want for a large sum. We have the budget, too. I want it more than our fans. We'll do everything we can to bring him here. It's important that the player wants to come to Turkey and Besiktas. We don't want to force anyone to come because of money. We will enforce every condition.",

      "Manchester United could have the perfect opportunity to agree a swap deal in the near future.",
      "The signing of Benjamin Sesko could go on to have major ramifications in the United squad. The Reds signing the striker from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million with add-ons, with Sesko now expected to lead the line for the season ahead.",
      "The decision to sign Sesko has led to speculation around Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee's future at Old Trafford. In particular, it seems that Hojlund could be set to leave the club in light of Sesko's arrival.",

      "You can read more here.",
      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have announced that they will be scrapping their plans to protest against Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos prior to this weekend's opening-day fixture against Arsenal.",
      "The fan group who have been responsible for a number of protests against the Glazers in recent years announced last week that they were planning to hold their first against Ratcliffe on the opening-game weekend. The British petrochemicals billionaire has come under scrutiny since arriving at the club and strengthening the Glazers' hand at the club by purchasing minority shares in the Reds.",
      "Ratcliffe has also been responsible for a number of controversial cost-cutting measures which have included major redundancies and the reallocation of long-standing season ticket holders. However, in a statement first reported by PA, The 1958 confirmed the protest has been postponed due to a split within their membership.",
      "\"With a fanbase as diverse and passionate as ours, finding the right balance isn't always easy,\" they explained.",
      "\"We've had to consider momentum, timing, fan appetite, broader consequences of protest activity while assessing how current and future decisions may impact us as fans.",
      "\"Given the current sentiment within the fan-base and particularly in light of these recent survey results, it's clear there's no unified view on the direction of the club under Ratcliffe. That split is real, and we believe it would be irresponsible to risk creating a situation that could result in any 'red on red' conflict inside or outside the stadium.\"",
      "The 1958 also confirmed - in a poll of nearly 26,000 members - 63 per cent agreed that Ratcliffe should be held accountable by means of protest. However, 68 per cent also believed Ratcliffe and Ineos should be given more time to make their impression.",

      "After finishing the 2023/24 Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference, Manchester United should have prioritised attacking signings in last summer's transfer window. Instead they added in three defenders, one defensive-midfielder and just one attacker.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt arrived from Bayern Munich and Leny Yoro checked in from Lille to strengthen United's defence before Manuel Ugarte arrived from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day to beef up the midfield.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, Joshua Zirkzee was signed from Bologna to challenge Rasmus Hojlund at the tip of the attack. Neither player will be in Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Arsenal this weekend.",
      "Although United should have prioritised the addition of a starting striker last summer, they instead added a holding midfielder. In their defence, there was plenty of logic behind that rationale.",
      "Throughout the 2023/24 campaign, United were regularly exposed in midfield. Opponents took full advantage of gaping holes in the centre of the pitch that opened up amid Casemiro's staggering decline from the season prior.",
      "Regardless of how impressive Casemiro was during the 2022/23 campaign, he was only ever going to offer a short-term fix. United needed younger legs in the engine room and they identified Ugarte as their top target, despite former manager Erik ten Hag ranking him third on his personal wish list.",
      "Ugarte arrived on deadline day and did not make his debut until the other side of the September international break.",
      "The season was already more than a month old by the time he eventually made his first Premier League start, alongside Kobbie Mainoo for the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 30.",
      "Although there is still an obvious need for United to sign a midfielder again this summer, strengthening that particular area of the pitch was not their main priority when the window opened on June 1. Instead, they prioritised the signing of a striker.",
      "After getting both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door in time for the pre-season tour of the United States, United added another attacker to their ranks on Saturday, landing the centre-forward they desperately needed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has arrived from RB Leipzig for an initial fee of £66.4million and has completed United's attacking rebuild. Signing a five-year-deal, the 22-year-old has moved to Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany last term.",
      "To have added Sesko to the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of the start of the season is a massive boost for United and Amorim, who must be feeling incredibly tempted to unleash his three new attackers as a trio for the first time against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, seeing Viktor Gyokeres go to Arsenal and running the rule over Ollie Watkins only to see Aston Villa make it crystal clear he was not for sale, there was a risk United's striker search could have still been ongoing in the closing stages of the window.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes Benjamin Sesko will benefit from the presence of fellow summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this season.",
      "United completed their attacking overhaul with the addition of the Slovenian international from RB Leipzig on Saturday. He has joined the club for an initial fee of £66.4million, signing a five-year deal.",
      "Sesko has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last season, meaning he will have ambitions of producing a similar return in his debut season in England. However, some doubts have been raised about United's decision to recruit a second young striker from abroad in three years.",
      "However, Brown, speaking to William Hill, admitted he is optimistic Sesko will be able to deliver the goods in the Premier League, pointing to the attacking quality he will have around him.",
      "\"With those two [Cunha and Mbeumo], United have added two creative players, two very-attack minded players,\" Brown said, speaking on behalf of UK casinos. \"In the team, supporting him, that will really help.",
      "\"But I do think Sesko, in his own right, has had to sort of do that himself over the last two years. I know for a fact that clubs have been looking at him, and I think it is the right time that he went to a really, really big club.",
      "\"That is no disrespect to Leipzig, but he obviously wants to show what he can do on a bigger stage and I think now is the right time.",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is still there and he is the guy that did a lot last season. Amad will probably start at wing-back on the right-hand side and I think United have got a lot of players, that if they did get injuries, can come straight in and stick to the same routine.",
      "\"But United have these three individuals [Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko] that, respectfully for their own teams, have done really well over the last couple of years.\"",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United have brought in four few faces so far, spending the best part of £200m. Sesko has become the latest headline addition and Brown says the Reds have done a great job in the market thus far",
      "The former United defender added: \"It has been very positive. I think the players they have brought in have been excellent, to be honest.",
      "\"You get Cunha who is a presence and was probably the best attacking player in his team. He has got a bit about himself as well that United have missed over the years a little bit.",
      "\"Diego Leon is very promising, he looks strong, sharp and he knows his position. Then you get Mbeumo and Sesko and you are like, 'okay, this is good'.",
      "\"For me Mbeumo has been the best player for the last two years in the sense that what he has been able to continue doing through his club at the time. Sesko, I know a lot of teams have been looking at him for a good few years, so he has actually come with a lot of experience now, not just in leagues but in Europe as well.",
      "\"He is a big, tall lad, he knows how to play, he's good with his feet, can score with his head and you do have to say they have done a really good job.\"",

      "Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has admitted he gave Manchester United the green light to sign him back in 2012.",
      "On the books of German club Borussia Dortmund at the time, Lewandowski was beginning to emerge as one of Europe's best strikers after scoring 30 goals in 47 matches for the Bundesliga side during the 2011/12 campaign.",
      "After missing out on the Premier League title to rivals Manchester City on goal difference in 2011/12, United prioritised the addition of a striker ahead of the 2012/13 campaign.",
      "Robin van Persie, of course, arrived from Arsenal and he scored 30 goals across all competitions, including 26 in the Premier League to ensure United reclaimed their crown and he won the Golden Boot.",
      "However, Lewandowski, who will turn 37 later this month, has revealed he \"said yes\" to United that summer, admitting he wanted to link up with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"To Manchester United I decided and said yes,\" Lewandowski told BBC Sport. \"I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "However, Dortmund were not prepared to let go of their talisman, meaning he remained at the club until he joined Bayern Munich in July 2014 on a free transfer after signing a pre-contract agreement earlier in the year. His last two seasons at Dortmund saw him plunder 64 goals.",
      "\"They could not sell me,\" Lewandowski added, addressing Dortmund's reluctance to lose him at the time of United's interest. \"Because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could wait maybe one or two more years.",
      "\"But it is true that I said yes to Manchester United.\"",
      "Following his time at Dortmund, Lewandowski spent eight years at Bayern before joining Barcelona in 2022. Despite turning 37 next week, he scored a whopping 42 goals for the La Liga champions last term.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The new season is upon Manchester United and they have three new forwards to pit against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival eight days before United's opening Premier League fixture is well timed. United head coach Ruben Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo up front in United's friendly draws with Fiorentina and Everton.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester on Thursday and he has already dined at Spinningfields and San Carlo as he settles into his new home. More importantly, he will have had a full week to familiarise himself with his new teammates at Carrington.",
      "Here are some talking points from Sesko's first training session at United:",
      "United uploaded pictures from their post-Fiorentina training session on Monday but they are dated Sunday August 10. So the session took place the day after the 1-1 draw.",
      "The day after a match is a recovery day for starters. Bruno Fernandes was captured by club photographers but he looks more like a ball-boy than a participant.",
      "Every substitute who came on against Fiorentina (Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot) is accounted for. So are unused substitutes Tom Heaton, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, Toby Collyer, Diego Leon and Dermot Mee.",
      "The only substitute not visible in the imagery is Rasmus Hojlund. That seems somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "Sesko will have had a full week of training to prepare for the Arsenal match. United players are bullish about the new season partly due to the ample recovery time they will have between matches in the absence of any European football but August is always a sparse month.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko played 45 minutes for RB Leipzig during their pre-season schedule and that was on July 19, so he is short of minutes. Amorim has ensured the majority of United's core squad members have had sufficient playing time over their five friendlies (Fernandes and Amad were the only two to start all five friendlies) and United looked fitter than they had done in pre-season for several years.",
      "Yet with Hojlund out in the cold, Joshua Zirkzee only just back from injury and no other senior striker, Sesko has to start. A full week at Carrington should stand him in good stead.",
      "Defender Noussair Mazraoui remains an injury concern ahead of United's Premier League opener.",
      "The Morocco international missed United's final four games of pre-season after featuring in the first half of their opening friendly of the summer against Leeds United just over three weeks ago.",
      "Despite travelling to the United States for the club's pre-season tour, he played no part in any of their Premier League Summer Series fixtures and was last pictured training two days before the tour opener against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Since the United squad returned to England early last week, the club has not uploaded any training images or footage of the defender, meaning he could miss out on Sunday.",
      "With plenty of first-team players not taking part in the session, United boosted the numbers by including some academy players. Among those pictured were Jaydan Kamason, Fredricson, Rhys Bennett, Jacob Devaney, Sekou Kone, James Scanlon, Ethan Ennis, Ethan Williams and Bendito Mantato.",
      "Fredricson was the only player from the aforementioned list to be included in the matchday squad against Fiorentina, but he failed to make it off the bench.",
      "Alongside Fredricson, Kone, Williams and Mantato were named in the United squad for their tour of the US.",

      "United will enter the competition at the second round stage, having previously entered the League Cup at the third round stage. Teams who are participating in Europe don't play their first Carabao Cup game of the season until the third round, and with no European football at Old Trafford this season United will have to win a second round tie to be in the hat for round three.",
      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur will all enter the competition in round three.",
      "United won the Carabao Cup during Erk ten Hag's first season at the club, beating Newcastle 2-0 in the final. They were then knocked out by the Magpies in round four the following season before exiting at the quarter-final stage last term with defeat at Tottenham.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "There was a slightly surreal interaction on North State Street in Chicago during Manchester United's pre-season tour. While walking back from a CVS pharmacy one evening, it soon became apparent I was gaining on a few United players out for an evening stroll.",
      "Harry Maguire was the most conspicuous. Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw were in front of him. Suddenly, there was a whistle and someone left behind jogged past me to catch up with the group: Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Hojlund muttered something and then, awkwardly, Maguire started to slow down. He turned around.",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "Possibly the three most oft-used words during interactions between British males. That was the sum of my 'night out' with United players.",
      "Reading between the lines, Hojlund had clocked me and made his teammates aware. Fernandes and Shaw did not even break stride. Maguire was perfectly polite.",
      "Hojlund was bound to recognise me as he once dedicated an Instagram post to me. Piqued by a story that some United players were reluctant to pass the ball to him, two days later he came on and scored the winner against Newcastle United and commemorated the moment on social media.",
      "On the pitch, Hojlund opted for a 'shhh' celebration, pressing his index finger against his lips. He did not silence the doubters last season. Hojlund scraped three goals in his final 35 appearances of 2024-25 and United are now brazenly pushing him out when they were once so protective.",
      "United were angry (on Hojlund's behalf) over the aforementioned story. Another member of their communications department has never celebrated more wildly in a press box than when Hojlund ended his goal drought at Leicester in March.",
      "Hojlund is not short of allies but he is now isolated. He started ball juggling during his warm up in the first half against Fiorentina on Saturday. That was a tell-tale sign he was never going to get on.",
      "In Chicago, Ruben Amorim refused to give assurances that Hojlund, who performed decently on tour, would stay. A few minutes later, Hojlund strolled into the mixed zone and asked if anyone wanted to talk to him. It was not lighthearted.",
      "One club cannot house two £70m-odd strikers. Benjamin Sesko's fee is marginally more than Hojlund's two years ago. Both are overpriced but Sesko's value feels fairer, given his development and reputation. He has been on United's radar for at least three years, too.",
      "Hojlund is an easy fall guy for the Ineos cabal. He was signed by the previous regime, Sir Jim Ratcliffe included him among the players that he had \"inherited\" and Hojlund's record is indefensible: 26 goals in 95 appearances.",
      "Admittedly, he started both seasons recovering from an injury. After he returned from a hamstring tear in September, Hojlund did not sustain another injury. Hojlund started 38 fixtures and his longest run on the bench was two games in 2024-25.",
      "He was never good enough to lead the line for United and was always destined to fail. The final fee of £64m up front rising to £72m contradicted United's brief that they would not break £60m for their new centre forward.",
      "Switching to the same agency that represented the manager heaped more pressure onto Hojlund. Erik ten Hag would have preferred Harry Kane but Ten Hag told confidants Hojlund had a \"proven goalscoring profile\". He didn't.",
      "Then there was the support striker, Anthony Martial. If you literally leant on Martial for support, he would break something. The Frenchman was as durable as a collection of bamboo sticks and did not play once for United in his final five months at the club.",
      "There were glimpses that Hojlund could be a long-term frontman. He unnerved William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes on his debut at Arsenal, plundered five goals in four Champions League starts and was the Premier League Player of the Month in February 2024 with five goals in four games. Hojlund was so pivotal that his muscular injury at the end of that month preceded United's home defeat to Fulham which ended their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons. They had to bring in a new No.9. So Hojlund had to make way.",
      "The noises from the hierarchy were unkind. One high-profile figure questioned Hojlund's work rate. The hesitancy to play the ball to Hojlund was never more public than when Diogo Dalot decided against crossing to him against Real Sociedad.",
      "Marcus Rashford's cousin derided Hojlund's pressing and how often he lost challenges. Another senior teammate shook his head at United's striker options and sighed, \"F*****g hell.\"",
      "The direction of travel has been that Hojlund would end up travelling elsewhere. Yet, if or when he does, United do not have a senior striker to provide back up for Sesko.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, scorer of seven goals in 49 games, is not a No.9 and not an outright No.10. Football's pseudo-intellectuals might dub him a 'nine-and-a-half'. Ie. neither here nor there.",
      "Zirkzee has been injured for practically four months. He has not had a kick in pre-season and was rushed back from a hamstring injury for the Europa League final. That told everyone what Amorim thought of Hojlund.",
      "United have a lighter work load this season and require a lighter squad. Chido Obi decamped to the first team in February but is only 17 and does not have a locker in the new Carrington dressing room yet. Instead, he is in the \"halfway house\" changing area reserved for emerging talent.",
      "Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo through the middle in United's last two friendlies. He has auxiliary options.",
      "However much longer Hojlund remains at United, he is likely to be left behind.",

      "It's also been a busy summer on the transfer front for United, with three new signings being confirmed already. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all joined - as well as Diego Leon after a deal was struck in January - and there is the possibility that more will happen before the deadline.",
      "United have also sanctioned some departures this summer, with Marcus Rashford leaving to join Barcelona on loan. More players could leave Old Trafford before the September 1 deadline, with the potential for some deals to be completed before the clash against Arsenal arrives on Sunday.",
      "In terms of new signings, the one player who is being linked with a move to United the most is Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has emerged as a target for United this summer, but it remains to be seen if a deal will be agreed with the Seagulls.",
      "There have been reports that Brighton would demand around £100million, or more, to allow Baleba to leave the club this summer. While unlikely, there is still the possibility that a deal could be done over the next week if United wish to do so.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho could also leave United this week amid reported interest from Chelsea. There could also be resolutions to Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia's futures after the trio informed United of their desire to leave the club earlier in the summer.",

      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",
      "United's transfer spend already exceeds £200million and spending that much on one player would be a huge commitment. Which is why Adam Wharton would be a brilliant alternative signing.",
      "Of course, Palace themselves would want a huge transfer fee, previously valued at around £60million. It's fair to say that his value is only going to increase after shining in the FA Cup-winning run last season and more recently in the Community Shield triumph over Liverpool.",
      "CIES Football Observatory, who use a sample of more than 8,000 past transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable, believe the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Even if United have to pay in excess of £60million, that should be considered a bargain for one of Europe's top midfielders and a rising star in English football.",
      "The current United ownership have stressed the importance of not making similar mistakes in the transfer market, given their torrid fall from grace. And yet, taking inspiration from the Sir Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford could see them restore their place at England's top table.",
      "Under Ferguson, United would have the best of English talents - Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick. Wharton has the potential to be right among that calibre of players.",
      "Also just 21-years-old, his best years are ahead of him and if continues to perform as he has for Palace, it's only a matter of time before a top club comes calling. Manchester United should be at the front of the queue.",

      "Manchester United summer signing Diego Leon continues to train with the first-team.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Paraguay club Cerro Porteno to sign Leon, who was due to be assessed throughout pre-season before a decision was made on his next steps.",
      "The options of playing for the Under-21s or going out on loan were considered, but the current indicators suggest that Leon will contribute to United's first-team squad this season.",
      "Leon made a strong first impression at Carrington and was handed a first-team squad number (30) before the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Stockholm. Ruben Amorim started Leon in that friendly and he made substitute appearances against West Ham and Bournemouth in the United States.",
      "The 18-year-old has now switched squad number, changing to No.35, with Benjamin Sesko expected to inherit his former number, but that does not mean Leon has been demoted.",
      "Leon was formally introduced at Old Trafford alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko before the Fiorentina friendly on Saturday, further pointing to a first-team role.",
      "He was an unused substitute and is understood to have trained with the first-team again on Sunday, as the players who were not involved against Fiorentina trained at Carrington on the following day.",
      "When Leon spoke to journalists in Paraguay before his arrival in Manchester, he promised to \"kill it\" in pre-season to impress Amorim.",
      "Leon has also impressed his teammates and Patrick Dorgu praised him after facing Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "\"He's a top, top player,\" said Dorgu. \"He's a good player, he's good for everyone. Everyone has competition in their positions. Every player has two or three players in their position. It's just going to help the team even more. Everyone's going to be on their toes, everyone's going to give 100 per cent to the team.\"",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",

There’s more than one reason why tinfoil and not gold leaf is the preferred method for covering your cardboard FA Cup when your local non-league team reaches the first round for the first time.",
      "The ‘Korean-style’ collar also looks a bit odd. We’re going to have our cake and eat it here; despite our frequent complaints about the modern trend for plain boring crew-neck collars on football shirts, there are still times when they are a solid and appropriate choice, and one of those is when you’ve already made the rest of the kit ostentatiously showy gold.

It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",

      "There’s nothing particularly wrong with adidas’ home and away offerings on their first year back with Liverpool, but this is the one they’ve got absolutely right. This feels like it’ll be one of those kits that becomes a terrace staple for years to come.",

      "1. Arsenal away\nThere seems to be some strange and powerful magic that strikes any time adidas draw inspiration from a mid-90s Nike Arsenal kit. There’s something just nice and wholesome anyway in the way one of the two football kit giants is willing to acknowledge the work of the other and, while most would correctly agree that adidas are the correct company to make Arsenal kits – we will not and cannot elaborate, it’s just fact – Nike certainly made some cult classics.",

      "Among them was the 95/96 blue lightning bolt away kit that adidas are – not for the first time – leaning into here, taking the colour palette and lightning motif, throwing in more than a hint of their own classic late-80s designs and coming up with this absolute dazzler.",
      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",
      "Another thing in this shirt’s favour is that we vastly prefer the simple cannon logo to Arsenal’s full shield badge. We know why they don’t, but we strongly feel they should always just have the cannon. It is better."

      "That triggered a £110m bid from Liverpool, which was instantly rejected by the Geordies, and the Merseysiders will only go back in if they receive sufficient encouragement that a deal will be done.",
      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealed earlier on Tuesday that Isak ‘is adamant he will never represent Newcastle again’ despite the Magpies attempting to keep him.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘Even if they refuse to sell the 25-year-old Sweden striker and he remains on Tyneside when the transfer window closes, Isak regards his career at St James’s Park as finished and has no desire to reintegrate into the squad.’",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nAll signs point to this being utter horse sh*t, but with these two clubs, you never quite know. Chelsea would sell if the deal was right because business, and City have form for doing daft things. But surely even they wouldn’t do £200million-plus-£50million for a player they sold for £40million two years ago.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nWith Grealish gone and interest in Savinho, we could see this happening. And it’s great news for Real, with City, Liverpool and Arsenal threatening a bidding war that didn’t look likely at the start of the summer.",

      "",
      "18) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer. United are still trying, though, bless ’em.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",
      "",
      "15) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation. Nantes’ Matthis Abline is being eyed as a possible replacement should Newcastle come for Larsen.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against Palace in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "12) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly left the door ajar for Donnarumma’s departure, and it’s now swung open after he was left out of PSG’s squad for the Super Cup on Wednesday. Big Fab now claims he will ‘100% leave’ while ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",

      "5) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £35million-plus-£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least £40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nWe have a Newcastle ‘Here we go’, and a player who ‘only wanted’ them. The end is nigh, folks. Thiaw is in Tyneside for a medical.",

      "Man Utd have been responsible for three of the 20 biggest signings ever involving defenders, while rejecting then buying another who is in the top ten twice.",
      "",
      "1) Harry Maguire – £80m/€97m (Leicester to Man Utd, August 2019)\nAfter vetoing a summer 2018 move for Maguire because of a reticence to pay a potential world-record fee for a defender, Man Utd paid a very much real world-record fee for a defender to sign the Leicester centre-half the following year. And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol – £77m/€89m (Leipzig to Manchester City, August 2023)\nA standout World Cup for Croatia and another season of Bundesliga excellence – although Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland tried their utmost to ruin both respectively – finally earned Gvardiol his long-awaited Premier League move for less than the original world-record demands.",
      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",
      "",
      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Cancelo – £60m/€65m (Juventus to Manchester City, August 2019)\nSwapping places with Danilo, Cancelo went from bit-part player to one of the best in the league, then suddenly a Bayern Munich and Barcelona loanee and Saudi import, all within five ludicrous years.",
      "",
      "11) Aymeric Laporte – £57m/€65m (Athletic Bilbao to Manchester City, January 2018)\nAfter Manchester City balked at the numbers involved in procuring Van Dijk from Southampton, they simply switched them around and went for Laporte in a club-record move instead. It went less well but still OK.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £55m/€68m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt doesn’t feel as though the add-ons potentially taking this deal to £63m were activated in a dreadful couple of years for Cucurella the individual and the Chelsea collective. European Championship glory with Spain sparked a turnaround at club level.",
      "",
      "13) Illia Zabarnyi – £54.3m/€63m (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2025)\nAndoni Iraola would have preferred not to lose his entire centre-half pairing in the same summer Bournemouth also sold their left-back and returned their loanee keeper. But that is the model and such a phenomenal stepping stone must appeal to players.",
      "",
      "14) Leny Yoro – £52.1m/€61.8m (Lille to Man Utd, July 2024)\nAnother £7m in add-ons is built into a deal which saw Manchester United ‘outmanoeuvre’ Real Madrid and Liverpool by spending sums other clubs absolutely did not want to spend on an 18-year-old with 60 first-team career appearances.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Mendy – £52m/€57.5m (Monaco to Manchester City, July 2017)\nAn incredibly rare misstep for a Manchester City side which tends to spend such considerable sums well.",
      "",
      "16) David Luiz – £50m/€62.5m (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, June 2014)\nDomestic Quadruples were won in both his full seasons in Paris, before Chelsea bought the Brazilian straight back for £16m less.",
      "",
      "17) Dean Huijsen – £50m/€59.4m (Bournemouth to Real Madrid, June 2025)\nA ridiculous success story for Bournemouth, who plucked Huijsen from a panicking Juventus and flipped a huge profit on the Spanish centre-half within a single season when Real Madrid came calling.",
      "",
      "18) Benjamin White – £50m/€58m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nArsenal started the bidding at £42m and had five offers turned down before acquiescing to Brighton’s initial demand for a guaranteed £50m, and all parties can be happy with their lot.",
      "",
      "19) John Stones – £50m/€57m (Everton to Manchester City, August 2016)\nReckon it might be safe to assume the £2.5m in add-ons have been achieved for a brilliant defender and apparently even better midfielder, even if various parts of him are made of glass.",
      "",
      "20) Kyle Walker £50m/€56.7m (Tottenham to Manchester City, July 2017)\nIt seemed preposterous at the time but the only absurd thing six years on is just how much Walker won as a trusted Guardiola lieutenant before both player and club sought something new.",

      "But Inter are still holding out for the signing of Ademola Lookman, so with him as the plan A, Sancho is simply a back-up option.",

      "The actions of Manchester United, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest have created some remarkably bitter games ahead of the new Premier League season.",
      "It has felt like an especially busy summer in terms of clashes both legal and otherwise between Premier League clubs.",
      "The result is a series of games with a fresh level of animosity and spite built in the boardroom which could bleed into the stands and onto the pitch.",
      "",
      "10) Arsenal v Manchester United – The Proper No. 9 derby\nObviously not a new rivalry, but one imbued with a different layer to finally propel it into the modern age.",
      "Their meetings are almost exclusively used as an excuse for indulging in nostalgia and reminiscence, or lamenting how the game just isn’t as compelling or rough around the edges as it once was.",
      "Trying to recall what happened between them last season is difficult but Pizzagate, Ruud van Nistelrooy versus Martin Keown, Roy Keane protecting Gary Neville from Patrick Vieira in the tunnel and Alex Ferguson pronouncing ‘Japan’ weirdly are all firmly embedded in the psyche and form a routine part of the pre-game build-up when the Gunners face the Red Devils.",
      "As a spectacle, the only hope of salvaging something meaningful from Arsenal v Manchester United is to feed into the contemporary phenomenon of manufacturing rivalries between players. And Viktor Gyokeres versus Benjamin Sesko has been ripening all summer long for that particular picking.",
      "The dream scenario of Gyokeres flopping for Arsenal while Sesko single-footedly drags Manchester United towards competence remains live, but really the alternative timeline in which Gyokeres delivers the title and Sesko proves to be a hilariously expensive gamble gone wrong is every bit as fun and enticing.",
      "It certainly feels a more even battle than the Erling Haaland v Darwin Nunez feud built entirely out of laborious comparisons between two pricey centre-forwards who happened to be signed at the same time by clubs with substantial fanbases.",
      "At least here there is enough evidence to suggest Arsenal and Manchester United would both have been happy settling for the other striker. And their opening weekend clash gets the ball rolling on unavoidable proceedings immediately.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds v Sunderland – The Summer Spend derby\nWhile sacking Peter Reid and flirting with financial implosion was the strongest common denominator between Leeds and Sunderland prior to this summer, promotion has pulled them closer together despite being remarkably far apart in their approach to Premier League preparation.",
      "Leeds have recruited sensibly if slowly, focusing on defensive additions to solidify their spine and avoid having to make another panicked May phone call to Sam Allardyce.",
      "Fees have been spent on a goalkeeper, two centre-halves, a left-back and two more defensive-minded midfielders. The free agent Lukas Nmecha has been their only attacking signing after a move for Igor Paixao proved too difficult.",
      "Sunderland have taken a slightly different view, albeit out of necessity due to a less prepared squad and to offset sales. Only seven clubs in the entire world have spent more than the Black Cats this summer, with Habib Diarra becoming their record signing.",
      "Trying to achieve the impossible feat of surviving in the Premier League as a promoted club already pitted Leeds and Sunderland against each other; that dichotomy in perceived ambition has stoked the flames for some.",
      "",
      "8) Chelsea v Liverpool – The Tribunal To Determine Compensation derby\nAmong the many words used were ‘seething’ and ‘furious’ when Chelsea had what they felt was ‘a generational talent’ snatched from under their noses in summer 2024.",
      "Their habitual hoarding of ludicrously prodigious teenaged wide forwards at least compensates the selling club fairly; the final amount Liverpool will pay for Ngumoha is unknown but his pre-season performances suggest it won’t be commensurate to his ability and potential.",
      "The results of a tribunal to determine the compensation owed to Chelsea have not been disclosed but previous such hearings have only returned pay-outs of up to £10m, a valuation Ngumoha might well far exceed by the end of a season in which he only turns 17.",
      "A clear first-team pathway at Liverpool was crucial in the forward’s decision to move to Anfield and Arne Slot has already outlined the role Ngumoha can play across four competitions of a gruelling season.",
      "Chelsea will be keeping a keen eye, although arguably should have done so far sooner.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa v Manchester United – The Selection Methodology derby, ft. Emi Martinez and maybe Ollie Watkins\n“Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "“With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.”",
      "It was a wonderfully impotent announcement issued by an Aston Villa side who, by their own account, “acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such”.",
      "The PGMOL response never was revealed but could well have amounted to Howard Webb pointing out they should probably just have beaten a Manchester United side which had already lost 22 games last season by then, regardless of the referee chosen.",
      "Unai Emery hinted that Thomas Bramall had apologised for his “huge mistake” but the consequences of Villa failing to leave Old Trafford with the single point they needed for Champions League qualification are still being felt.",
      "Evann Guessand of Nice has been their only significant first-team signing and there has been a clear reluctance to make the same player PSR sacrifices which defined their summer of 2024.",
      "Emi Martinez was one of those made available for transfer but Manchester United rubbed salt in that wound by only asking for him on loan.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford v Newcastle – The Broken Promises derby\nAn alternative name pitch might be The Hypocrisy derby, so wonderfully has Newcastle’s entire transfer window captured the perennial insincerity at the very heart of football fandom.",
      "Alexander Isak is a treacherous, villainous turncoat who has betrayed Newcastle, been misadvised and refused to train, play or join the club on tour after having his head turned and ear burned by supposed broken promises about being allowed to go.",
      "Yoane Wissa just wants to leave Brentford and is being held against his will.",
      "These contortions and contradictions are a necessary part of supporting a club but a Brentford side already pillaged by richer and bigger teams must have enjoyed any and all attempts to paint Newcastle as an innocent victim of the hierarchy this summer.",
      "",
      "5) Newcastle v Manchester United – The Transfer Food Chain derby\nThe Magpies have, however, been reminded of their place in that food chain to an uproariously chastening degree.",
      "Their best version in a generation, arguably ever, has been routinely upstaged by the worst modern iteration of Manchester United by an absurd margin.",
      "Champions League qualification and a trophy has been outweighed by the very fact Old Trafford is crumbling and players would prefer to be part of rebuilding it rather than having to call Jason Tindall ‘Bossman’.",
      "The semantics on Matheus Cunha can and have been debated but Newcastle were absolutely interested in Bryan Mbeumo before the player removed himself from their equation after Ruben Amorim’s admiring glances, while the moves were put on Benjamin Sesko before his public rejection of the Eddie Howe project.",
      "Newcastle still and will always have a win in the Alan Shearer battle of 1996, but their war over signings with Manchester United incurred some really quite embarrassing casualties in 2025.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United v Brentford – The Refuse To Be Held For Ransom derby\nThe most high-profile of these disputes this summer have largely involved the same set of clubs cast in different roles: Newcastle as both victim and aggressor; Nottingham Forest as predator and prey.",
      "Manchester United trying to pretend they were fighting the good fight against Brentford was a curious development but Sir Jim Ratcliffe has to get his kicks somewhere and if it doesn’t involve people losing jobs we should take it.",
      "There were 44 days between Manchester United bidding £45m plus £10m in add-ons for Mbeumo and agreeing a deal at £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "The intervening weeks were filled with intermittent noise including a claim the buying club would not be held to ‘ransom’, which they eventually and inevitably were.",
      "But even upon the conclusion of the deal, Manchester United were not done. They leaked their fury with Brentford to the usual cabal of journalists after it emerged that the Bees shamefully tried to secure the best possible deal they could for their most valuable player.",
      "Good on little Manchester United for sticking it to big bad Brentford.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle v Liverpool – The £150m Valuation derby\nWhen the signing of a potential £79m forward is only ever presented as a secondary plot point to the wider overall narrative, you know a lot of water has gathered under the bridge connecting Newcastle and Liverpool.",
      "A wise sage once referred to their rivalry as ‘toxic’ because of 1) some results, 2) Newcastle once poaching an analyst from Liverpool, 3) Liverpool being one of many clubs to oppose their takeover, and 4) Liverpool having spent some money more than four decades ago, but this summer did mark a definitive turn in their relationship.",
      "The Ekitike hijack could be forgiven by a club who have known nothing different in this transfer window. A target choosing to join someone else is part and parcel of the game, and losing a race to the Premier League champions who will be among the Champions League favourites can be brushed off quickly.",
      "But the Isak saga has cast an uncomfortable cloud over Newcastle’s summer and left a sour taste. Even when handed all the cards of a three-year contract with no release clause and no need to make a book-balancing sale, the Magpies have looked thoroughly unconvincing with their hard-line stance.",
      "They did land one shot with the loaded claim that Liverpool had ‘bottled’ their first and as yet only actual bid for Isak but there is a clear sense that even if he stays, the damage has been done.",
      "The best-case scenario for Newcastle is that they will be without their best player for the first couple of games of the season, and perhaps on a mental level well beyond that, before he recovers something close to the form which has made him so desirable.",
      "But bridges between player and club can be mended if not fixed completely; any club-to-club camaraderie has been torched.",
      "",
      "2) Nottingham Forest v Spurs – The Release Clause derby\nIt seems like an age since the capture of Mohammed Kudus was followed up with the stunning revelation that Spurs would be signing Morgan Gibbs-White the next day.",
      "More than a month has passed and not only have Spurs not invested that £60m elsewhere, they have also lost to a probable season-long injury the sort of player Gibbs-White would have shared the creative burden with.",
      "Daniel Levy still struggles to understand Spurs fans and was given a public crash course in Evangelos Marinakis this summer too. But the Spurs chairman has played the role of 2013 Arsenal impeccably, understandably but clearly mistakenly believing that triggering a release clause in the contract of a player keen to join would indeed be enough to procure them.",
      "One legal threat, renewed deal and announcement with the air of a hostage video later, all with Marinakis front and centre, Spurs were left wondering what had just happened while Forest merrily went about their business.",
      "Then it emerged that Marinakis felt ‘it would have been a backward step’ for Gibbs-White to leave the City Ground for Spurs and suddenly sacking Nuno or waiting to poach Brennan Johnson felt remarkably tame.",
      "",
      "1) Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest – The Blind Trust derby\nA trick has been missed. There is a chance to rectify it, even if that would require some manoeuvring and would impact a few different clubs. But it must be done.",
      "One of the games between Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, currently scheduled for late August and January, must be moved to March 1. The narrative must be fed.",
      "It shouldn’t be that match at Selhurst Park on the season’s second weekend; that promises to be biblical. Palace’s first home game, their demotion from the Europa League for Forest to benefit still fresh, perhaps with the FA Cup and Community Shield paraded beforehand, played in between a pair of Conference League play-off qualifier legs, will have a glorious edge to it.",
      "Steve Parish certainly won’t be rushing to offer out any executive boxes.",
      "If Forest supporters aren’t already arranging chants of “decisive influence” to the ‘is there a fire drill?’ tune, or scribbling ‘Rules Are Rules’ on a crude Photoshop of Marinakis and John Textor shaking hands, then they too should have their Europa spot revoked.",
      "And if the losing team doesn’t take the result to the Court of Arbitration for Sport it’s worth wondering what we’re all doing here.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has stepped down from his role to avoid future complications if the club qualify for Europe."

      "We bring you the top 10 favourites for the Golden Boot according to the latest odds; we will update once the Premier League goals start going in…",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Solanke (Tottenham)\nThe odds are long at 33/1 – he only scored nine Premier League goals last season – but he is still ahead of Omar Marmoush and Liam Delap among others. Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "7=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nOddly long odds – 25/1 – for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield, after all.",

      "7=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "5=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 13/2 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",
      "",
      "2=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Golden Boot holder broke several records on the final day of last season, but the Egyptian is now 33, it’s an Africa Cup of Nations season, and he’s no longer playing for a new contract.",
      "",
      "2=) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nThe top scorer in 2024 is only being beaten in 2025 by Kylian Mbappe, but he is untested at this kind of level. The final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw? If that’s true, the Golden Boot trophy will surely come with a Premier League title win.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nWe all just assume he will be brilliant, right? Even after that embarrassing 22-goal season.",

      "Sesko was given a straight choice between the two and opted for United despite their worst-ever Premier League finish last term and Newcastle’s offer of Champions League football.",
      "The Magpies were also keen on Bryan Mbeumo, who moved to Old Trafford from Brentford earlier in the summer, and now could be beaten by the Red Devils to free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Ben Jacobs revealed interest from Newcastle in Calvert-Lewin last month, writing on X: ‘Newcastle retain an interest in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but are reticent to meet his terms. Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.’",
      "‘A move will only progress if Calvert-Lewin reduces his terms from 12 months ago when #NUFC made a concrete offer. And even then, Newcastle are somewhat wary of Calvert-Lewin’s injury record.’",
      "Around the same time in early July, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Man Utd interest in Calvert-Lewin, he said: “What happened with Calvert-Lewin is that the player has been offered to Manchester United.",
      "“It’s not that Man United started negotiations for Calvert-Lewin as new striker. The player has been offered as an opportunity on a free transfer, a cheap opportunity for a player who has experience, knows the league and can be helpful for any club.",
      "“So Man United registered the eventual cost of the deal. It means, obviously, the salary, the commission, the intention of the player, who would be, obviously, very open and excited to join Manchester United eventually in this summer transfer window.",
      "“But at the moment, it’s not yet a concrete negotiation.”",
      "CaughtOffside claimed on Sunday that Man Utd are considering the England international ‘as back-up option’, ‘exploring the possibility of adding Calvert-Lewin to Ruben Amorim’s squad as a depth option in attack’.",
      "The website insist Newcastle could still be an option and add on Man Utd interest: ‘The new United boss is keen on having a strong rotational setup, viewing the former Everton man as a capable third or fourth-choice striker who could provide valuable cover across a long season.’",
      "And The Sun now claim Calvert-Lewin has ‘ditched his representative and is hoping for a deal at Manchester United’, opting to ‘do his own transfer negotiations as he looks for a new club’.",
      "Man Utd have joined the race to sign former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin as they look for a ‘back-up option’ for Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Paris Saint-Germain exclude Gigio Donnarumma from their squad for UEFA Super Cup. Donnarumma will not sign new deal at PSG, there’s no agreement and he will 100% leave the club, this summer or in 2026 as free agent. Gigio’s camp feel it’s unfair situation for the GK.’",
      "He later added: ‘Gigio Donnarumma will leave Paris St Germain for sure, most likely this or eventually next summer. The relationship is completely broken after club decide to exclude Gigio from their squad for Super Cup. Understand Premier League is the most likely destination.’",
      "Donnarumma is currently valued by Transfermarkt at €40m [£35m] but The Sun claim PSG are willing to listen to offers of just £26m for the goalkeeper.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United have the funds to sign Donnarumma without selling members of their bomb squad, though they’ve remarkably managed to secure the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon for a combined £198m despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s insistence that they would have been “bust by Christmas” had he not saved their bacon, so what’s an extra £26m?",

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘direct meetings’ for the signing of a Champions League-winning star who’s been told to find a new club.",
      "United have done a good job improving their forward line this summer. Last term, no Red Devil surpassed 10 Premier League goals, and only Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo got to eight.",
      "As a result, three new attackers have been signed: Matheus Cunha, Bryam Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They scored 17, 20 and 21 goals respectively last term, and should be a huge help to United’s attack.",
      "But other areas of the pitch are in need of a touch-up following a 15th-placed Premier League finish. Andre Onana made three errors leading to goals in the league last season, and United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Amid the revelation that Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been told to find a new club – despite keeping six clean sheets in his club’s triumphant Champions League campaign last season, including one in the final – United have been looking at him.",
      "Now, Centre Devils reports the club have ‘held direct meetings’ for Donnarumma. Ruben Amorim is said to be a ‘big fan’ of the Italian goalkeeper, and is therefore considering him as United’s next No.1.",
      "That builds on reports which detailed why Donnarumma looks likely to be leaving PSG. It is suggested that the French club expect offers from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, who have all collected information from the goalkeeper’s agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "It was also said that with one year left on his deal in Paris, Donnarumma wanted to extend his deal, but could not come to an agreement with his club.",
      "Already one of the highest earners at the club, the Italian is said to have wanted a pay rise, and refused to accept the new salary structure of lower wages with big incentives on performances.",
      "Whether United would be able to give the Champions League winner the type of contract he wants, and probably deserves after his performances last season, remains to be seen.",
      "They have spent a lot of money on transfers this summer and thus far have not recouped any of it in sales. Wantaways Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are all yet to be sold, so that could bring in some cash.",
      "But whether that goes towards the signing of Donnarumma remains to be seen.",

      "Eddie Howe is pretty high in the betting, with only three Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",
      "",
      "15=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "15=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "4=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "La Liga giants Real Madrid are planning an ‘early offer’ to sign youngster Max Dowman from Premier League side Arsenal, according to reports.",
      "Valencia have reportedly viewed a comment by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta as a ‘threat’ following the sale of Cristhian Mosquera to the Premier League club.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success."

      "Dominic Solanke’s injury is apparently minor enough that we can just about look past the fact Richarlison is starting up front for Spurs in big 2025.",
      "Richarlison will be moved on if Spurs get the rest of the window anything other than catastrophically wrong, so expect to see him play 35 Premier League games this season.",
      "We still think the more glaring problem in the starting XI in Munich concerns a player who clearly does have a Spurs future, just not in the position he’s currently being deployed. Pape Sarr is a fine young midfielder with a varied toolbox. We’re keen on him.",
      "But he is not, and we suspect never will be, a creative No. 10. There are worse midfield threes than him, Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha for sure, but there aren’t many less progressive ones.",
      "In the absence of anyone notably prolific within the front three, it’s going to be a long and dreary season watching Spurs bash their head against brick wall after brick wall if they don’t come up with some kind of solution to the long-term absence of both James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski.",

      "And if Arne Slot was minded to do something about that it would be a thought instantly cast from his mind by a glance along a substitutes’ bench that revealed Endo as the closest thing available to another centre-back.",
      "Liverpool have spent giant wads of cash making their title-winning team even better, with the current conspicuous exception of centre-back where Jarell Quansah’s sale is the only significant change.",
      "They appear to be relying on at least one of Konate and Joe Gomez being available at all times, which doesn’t have a vast amount of historical data to support it. And even then it relies on the notion that a 34-year-old Van Dijk can simply be asked to play all of the football all of the time to a consistently excellent standard.",
      "It’s been noted elsewhere, but Marc Guehi having such a fine game against Liverpool’s sparkling array of attacking options in a game where Palace frequently exposed Liverpool’s under-stocked defence might not actually prove to be good news for Palace in the longer term.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Anthony Gordon as centre-forward\nIt has not been a fun summer for Newcastle, with the worst part of a 2-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the coveted Sela Cup not even the fact they had little choice but to start with Anthony Gordon up front, but the sight of him hobbling off in the closing stages.",
      "So now, among everything else they’ve got to contend with, they’ve gone from the frying pan of ‘Anthony Gordon is our starting centre-forward’ to the fire of ‘We must desperately hope Anthony Gordon is fit enough to be our starting centre-forward’.",
      "The Alexander Isak situation is no good at all for Newcastle, very obviously, but it’s far from the only worry. Jamaal Lascelles was captain against Atleti, for instance. With all due respect, Jamaal Lascelles captaining Newcastle in 2025 would have been some way down the list of post-takeover ambitions,",
      "Nevertheless, because we are sickos, we do want to see precisely what happens should Newcastle find themselves having to play an entire season with an attack made up of assorted flavour of tricky winger. Gordon, Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga has the look of an enormously fun, if not particularly effective, attacking trio, one where they’re all either constantly far too far apart or treading on each other’s toes and where Newcastle go from Isak’s elite goalscoring to finishing this season with Joelinton (9) as their top league goalscorer.",

Please tell us your elaborate transfer masterplan, one that started with having to sack all manner of regular Joe Sixpacks while pleading poverty and then spending hundreds of millions of pounds on all manner of new players while recouping almost none of that in sales doesn’t also involve Casemiro as a starter?",
      "We’re reeling so hard from the sight of this a week before the start of the season that we’ve barely even registered a front three of Mbuemo, Mount and Cunha. We do at least know United have taken steps to remedy that with the arrival of the big-jumping and occasional goal-scoring Benjamin Sesko, a man who definitely won’t be the latest not-quite-elite striker to be chewed up and spat out by the sheer ridiculousness of this particular Football Club We’re Talking About.",

But however much we may come to rationalise the idea that Chelsea’s insane transfer policy might in fact be perfectly suited to football’s insane world, we will never, ever allow it to become normalised that here lies a football club willing to spend half-a-billion pounds a year putting elite players on eight-year contracts yet continuing to entrust a really very important job indeed to a man who couldn’t keep Jason Steele out of the Brighton team.",

      "Of all the things we don’t really understand or even pretend to understand about how Chelsea’s transfer policy works, this is the thing we don’t understand the most. Especially now they have actual strikers."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st – £53.1m",
      "2nd – £50.4m",
      "3rd – £47.7m",
      "4th – £45m",
      "5th – £42.4m",
      "6th – £39.8m",
      "7th – £37.1m",
      "8th – £34.5m",
      "9th – £31.9m",
      "10th – £29.1m",
      "11th – £26.5m",
      "12th – £23.8m",
      "13th – £21.2m",
      "14th – £18.6m",
      "15th – £15.9m",
      "16th – £13.3m",
      "17th – £10.7m",
      "18th – £7.9m",
      "19th – £5.2m",
      "20th – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",
      "MORE ON PREMIER LEAGUE SPENDING FROM F365\n👉 Premier League net spend table over the last five years\n👉 The biggest spender in every Premier League season – and how they fared",
      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Manchester United legend Mikael Silvestre has warned the club there are “not a lot” of the type of player they are willing to let go of around, and they should “absolutely not” rush into seeing the back of him.",
      "United have had a successful summer in terms of incomings. They have spent around £200million on attacking talents Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as well as young left-back Diego Leon.",
      "The outgoings have not been as regular. Marcus Rashford is the only big first-team player to leave, having gone on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Another forward could also be pushed out as a result of the signing of Sesko, as multiple reports have suggested that addition has meant there’s no space for Rasmus Hojlund anymore.",
      "Speaking about the signing of the RB Leipzig striker, United legend Silvestre warned Ruben Amorim and the Red Devils board that should not mean Hojlund is sold.",
      "He said: “Marcus Rashford has gone and there are not a lot of strikers around, Joshua Zirkzee is a different type of striker that doesn’t make those runs in behind the defence.",
      "“He is another type of player for certain games, certain opposition. But no, you need competition, need quality, so I wouldn’t rush into sending Rasmus Hojlund out on loan. Absolutely not.”",
      "There is a chance that it’s not just a loan deal that Hojlund leaves on, as reports have suggested United would actually prefer to sell him, while the Denmark international is now ‘reluctantly ready to leave’.",
      "Transfer insider Ben Jacobs has said: ‘Rasmus Hojlund has now been directly told he’ll need to leave to gain minutes this season and is considering his options. Manchester United prefer to sell, but have not ruled out a loan. Milan prepared to meet #MUFC’s £40m valuation via a loan fee and buy option. Further talks took place yesterday.’",
      "As a result of United telling Hojlund to leave, though some don’t think he should, it is suggested he has accepted that might be best.",
      "Indeed, it’s been stated he is reluctantly ready to leave – despite recently suggesting he is hopeful that he can stay and fight for his place at just 22 years old – and sources are accepting that Sesko’s arrival means the Dane’s days are numbered.",
      "After he scored just four Premier League goals in 32 games last season, it’s not a surprise that United have both signed a new striker, and will prioritise him and Zirkzee, who was signed after Hojlund and still has the faith of the coaches despite a lean first season.",
      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has moved out of his property in the North East as he continues to force a move to Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are ‘close to a total agreement’ with AC Milan for the 22-year-old, who’s set for ‘direct talks’ with Old Trafford chiefs on Tuesday.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Man Utd career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light."

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 12 August 2025 12:33, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "By Vikash Varange and Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Sunday 10 August 2025 14:07, UK",
      "AC Milan are in talks with Manchester United over the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Milan want to complete a loan deal with an option to buy, but United's preference is to do a permanent deal - or at least have a permanent element attached to any loan.",
      "They would consider offers of around £40m for the 22-year-old Denmark international.",
      "The £73.7m arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig is likely to limit Hojlund's game time for United moving forward if he stays.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday despite being the only recognised striker in the squad - he was the only first-team regular not to get on the pitch.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim opted to play Mason Mount as a false No 9 instead, telling MUTV afterwards: \"We struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.\"",
      "Hojlund wants to stay and fight for his place, but it is now clear he has joined the likes of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia as players United want out.",

      "Manchester United beat Fiorentina on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Snapdragon Cup at Old Trafford that saw Benjamin Sesko introduced to the crowd as their new striker.",
      "Sesko's move from RB Leipzig for a fee rising to £73.7m was confirmed on the morning of the match and he was presented to supporters on the pitch alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who both started for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "With the £50m revamp of their Carrington training ground also unveiled this week, there is a growing sense of renewal at United, although it did not take long for Fiorentina to pierce that when Simon Sohm seized upon sloppy defending to put the visitors ahead at a corner.",
      "United levelled it up midway through the first half when Bruno Fernandes whipped in a cross that Robin Gosens appeared to divert over the line amid a melee of bodies. David de Gea, honoured beforehand by his old club, was among those complaining of a foul.",
      "Sohm almost scored again after the break, striking the United crossbar. Fernandes, Harry Maguire and, in particular, Cunha searched for a winner for the home side in a second half that saw young defender Ayden Heaven depart the field due to an injury.",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:05, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "Manchester United's deal for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.",
      "Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 23:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."
