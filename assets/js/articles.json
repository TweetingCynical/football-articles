      "Former Manchester United starlet Mason Greenwood has been praised by Marseille team-mate Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman claims Greenwood could have been like Jude Bellingham in regards to stardom.",
      "Having emerged from the Red Devils' academy system, Bradford-born Greenwood swiftly made an impression under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and became the club's youngest European goalscorer at the age of just 17.",
      "In October 2022, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coersive behaviour. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service later discontinued these proceedings, and all charges were dropped in 2023.",
      "Greenwood was suspended by United after his arrest and was sent out on loan to Getafe that year. A year later, he made the permanent switch to Marseille. In Ligue 1, Greenwood has flourished, scoring 21 goals to tie with PSG's Ballon d'Or contender Ousmane Dembele atop the goal-scoring standings. Though some of his antics haven't gone down well with the club's fan base.",
      "His peer in France, Rabiot, has now claimed that Greenwood is an \"exceptional\" talent, and that he could have had a brand image like revered England and Real Madrid star Bellingham.",
      "\"Mason is an incredible player,\" Rabiot told The Athletic. \"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like (Jude) Bellingham. Mason would be the star.",
      "\"Because he's an exceptional player. He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, and he can dribble. We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\"",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille finished as distant Ligue 1 runners-up this season and have therefore qualified for the Champions League. Greenwood aided massively in these efforts, though it has been made clear that he has little chance of being named in an England squad again, having made his debut and sole appearance in 2020.",
      "Bellingham, the subject of Rabiot's comparison, however, is talismanic for his country at the age of 21, two years younger than former Red Devil Greenwood.",
      "Steve McLaren, who endured a short-lived stint at the helm of the Three Lions from 2006 to 2007, has been trying to tempt Greenwood into switching international allegiances to Jamaica, whom he now coaches.",
      "As per conditions set by FIFA, players can switch international allegiances if they have not played in more than three competitive matches for a senior national side before turning 21.",
      "Greenwood only kitted out once for England, in a 2020 UEFA Nations Legaue match against Iceland, and is therefore eligible to switch to the Reggae Boyz if he pleases.",
      "\"We are in contact all the time, with him [Greenwood] and his family,\" admitted Jamaica manager McLaren, who took up his current position in 2024. \"I am very confident he only wants to play for Jamaica. It is up to him when he moves forward with that. The ball is in his court.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "In the swirling vortex of the summer transfer window, few names are burning as brightly as Viktor Gyokeres at the moment. The Swedish striker – Sporting CP's goalscoring phenomenon – has become the subject of intense speculation, with several Premier League giants circling like hawks.",
      "Manchester United, under the stewardship of Gyokeres' former boss Ruben Amorim, have now emerged as frontrunners to secure the 27-year-old's signature, drawn by his prolific record of 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese champions.",
      "Arsenal, Chelsea and even Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been linked, but it's a move to Old Trafford that looks likeliest as things stand, especially with the Gunners also focusing on Benjamin Sesko and Chelsea pushing for Hugo Ekitike, having already signed Liam Delap at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Gyokeres' frustration with Sporting has boiled over, with reports indicating the striker is 'furious' over a broken promise. He has an £84m release clause in his contract, though it's understood a gentlemen's agreement was made which would allow Gyokeres to leave this summer if an offer of around £60m was tabled.",
      "However, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Sporting are now reluctance to honour this deal, leaving Gyokeres feeling betrayed. The club, having signed him for £20m from Coventry City in 2023, now stand to make a significant profit, and are now demanding at least £67m.",
      "This, naturally, has sparked tension, with eagle-eyed fans noticing that Gyokeres has now removed all reference to Sporting from his Instagram bio. Though it must be said, he's also taken down mention of Sweden's national team and his sponsor, Nike.",
      "Sporting's revised asking price may shed light on why Arsenal – previously considered favourites to sign the Swede – have cooled their interest.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to demand a weekly salary exceeding £250,000. And when combined with substantial agent fees, any potential deal becomes a costly proposition.",
      "The additional £7m Sporting have tacked onto the transfer fee has only made the move more prohibitive, and may have sewn distrust among potential buyers. However, the ongoing tension between player and club could accelerate negotiations, giving United and others a chance to capitalise on the situation.",
      "In a bold move, Gyokeres has turned down a staggering £30m-a-year offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal, underscoring his ambition to compete at the highest level. The lucrative proposal, which would have made him one of the world's best-paid players, was rejected, with Gyokeres prioritising a move to one of Europe's top leagues instead.",
      "Al-Hilal, eager to sign a marquee striker, targeted Gyokeres after their high-profile pursuit of Victor Osimhen collapsed last week. Osimhen, like Gyokeres, is linked with multiple Premier League clubs and reportedly rejected a lucrative £650,000-per-week offer from the PIF-backed outfit.",
      "Their rejections signal a focus on sporting ambition over financial reward. That said, securing either player will still require substantial investment, and United must be ready to meet significant financial demands if they want to land a superstar forward this summer.",
      "United's pursuit of Gyokeres could have been finalised by now had the club qualified for the Champions League. Earlier this year, Amorim identified Gyokeres as his top attacking target and laid significant groundwork for the transfer.",
      "It's said the Swedish striker would have quickly agreed to join the Red Devils had they defeated Tottenham in the Europa League final to secure a Champions League spot. However, United's loss in Bilbao changed things. Fabrizio Romano reckoned a \"99% chance\", but as they prioritised Matheus Cunha, it has certainly never been that clear cut.",
      "Gyokeres is now weighing up his options. While he remains open to a move to Old Trafford, interest from overseas clubs like PSG, Juventus, and Barcelona could see him lured elsewhere.",
      "United are in frequent contact with Sporting and Gyokeres' representatives to negotiate a deal, but without Champions League football, their proposal could be less compelling than those of other clubs.",
      "Gyokeres' future remains a tantalising puzzle as the transfer window's first deadline approaches on Monday evening. United's hopes of luring him to Manchester will be buoyed by Amorim's close relationship with the player and the club's ambitious attacking overhaul, highlighted by the recent capture of Matheus Cunha and potential arrival of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, a late twist remains possible. Arsenal could re-enter the race if their pursuit of Sesko falters and he takes the Al-Hilal cash, while whispers of interest from other Champions League clubs both domestic and overseas add uncertainty to United's chase.",
      "Gyokeres' next move will not only shape his career but could define the ambitions of whichever club secures his signature. For now, United hold the edge, but in football, nothing is certain until the ink dries."

      "Ex-West Ham star Ravel Morrison has discussed the huge telling-off he received from Hammers' vice-chairman Karren Brady. Morrison joined the Irons in 2012 for a three-year stint which was mostly spent out on loan.",
      "Under Sam Allardyce, the midfielder showcased glimpses of his raw talent that had led many to label him as one of the country's most naturally gifted footballers. Now 32, Morrison's career has been a mix of brilliant individual moments and off-pitch mayhem.",
      "Talking on the Undr The Cosh podcast, the former Derby County player recounted how he found himself in hot water with Brady for driving to training without a full UK licence.",
      "\"So, obviously, I drove to training on a provisional license, and Karren Brady went mad. She went mad. I didn't do that again,\" Morrison said. \"Someone must have told her. Like, I had to apologise, pick up the keys, get someone to pick me up from the car.\"",
      "When quizzed if he’d bought said car before getting a proper licence, Morrison said: \"A provisional license. I didn't live that far from the training ground, so I thought I could just [drive to training] quick... but I didn't get away with it with Karren.\"",
      "Morrison revealed the reason he hadn't taken his test is that he struggles to navigate the theory section, claiming he wasn't \"the brightest\". However, he said he does have a Jamaican and Mexican licence - but not an English one.",
      "The one-time Manchester United prodigy often found himself in the limelight just as much for his extraordinary goals as well as controversial incidents off the field. Yet speaking to The Athletic in June, Morrison argued that the root cause of his issues was often simple errors such as oversleeping and missing training, challenging the more damaging rumours tied to his reputation.",
      "\"I just couldn't wake up sometimes,\" he said. \"They were easy mistakes to make - stupid mistakes, yeah - but it's not like I was out drinking in town every weekend and having fights. It was only once in a blue moon when I would be late.",
      "\"What I've found is that if you get a reputation early on, it can stick with you through life. Or it does with me, anyway.\"",
      "Morrison has struggled to settle in a career that has taken him to 15 different clubs since 2010. As well as spells in the UK with the likes of Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City, Morrison has been all over the world.",
      "He has played in Italy with Lazio, Mexico with Atlas, and also had stints with Swedish club Ostersund, Dutch outfit ADO Den Haag and MLS side DC United. However, he does have regrets.",
      "\"If I could go back in time I would change 90% of my life,\" Morrison said on Rio Ferdinand's Vibe with Five podcast in 2021. \"But you have to look forward, you can't think about the past too much.\"",
      "Morrison departed the Hammers in 2015 after making 24 appearances and scoring five goals, but has fondly recalled his stint in east London as an \"enjoyable\" one. \"If I had the opportunity I'd have stayed with West Ham all the way through,\" he said in February 2021."

      "Manchester City are set to complete the signing of a second former Manchester United target for a combined £70million. Pep Guardiola has already welcomed Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri into the fray, and Lyon's Rayan Cherki now looks likely to follow suit.",
      "Both stars have been on United's radar in the past. After a bitterly disappointing campaign that ended with a 15th-placed Premier League finish and Europa League final heartbreak, this summer transfer window is a pivotal one for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been poached from top-flight Wolves for £62.5million, having mustered 15 league goals this season. Yet another of Vitor Pereira's stars, Algerian full-back Ait-Nouri, has chosen the sky blue side of Manchester.",
      "He was a United target in the past, and he may not be the only star who once caught the Red Devils' eye to head to the Etihad this window. Reports suggest French technician Cherki could be on his way to Guardiola's side, and personal terms have already been agreed upon.",
      "Before he made his move from Angers to Wolves in 2020, the prodigious Ait-Nouri was reportedly of interest to then-Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Contact was supposedly made between the Manchester club and Ait-Nouri's super-agent Jorge Mendes, with whom he parted ways last month, and the teenager even flew to England to tour various training grounds, including those of United and their rivals City.",
      "In the end, neither of the two could secure the services of a young Ait-Nouri, who joined Wolves on an initial loan deal and signed permanently in 2021 for roughly £15m. At Molineux, the 24-year-old developed into a marauding wing-back and has now been snapped up by the Cityzens in a five-year deal worth £36m, with United missing out on their former target.",
      "One year before interest in Ait-Nouri was reported, Solskjaer also had his attention on another phenom, Lyon's Cherki, who was only 15 at the time. The Telegraph alleged that the Norwegian head coach had set his sights on the teenager.",
      "The Frenchman was regarded as one of Europe's premier attacking talents at his age group. That's why the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich were all battling to sign him.",
      "But Cherki ended up staying put. Having built up a reputation for having a rather problematic attitude, as highlighted by former coaches Fabio Grosso and Rudi Garcia, he has remained at the Groupama Stadium ever since.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has slammed Ruben Amorim for his unwavering commitment to his favoured 3-4-3 formation, despite results not going United's way since he took over at Old Trafford. After taking the reins in November, following an impressive stint at Sporting CP, Amorim struggled to hit the ground running with the Red Devils.",
      "He ultimately steered them to a 15th place finish in the league and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim, 40, managed a meagre seven wins out of 27 league games and subsequently missed out on European football qualification. Now, his relentless use of his preferred system has drawn criticism from Meulensteen.",
      "“I find it, in my personal opinion, a bit short-sighted in that respect,” Meulensteen said on the High Performance podcast. “I think if he worded it differently from the start, he would not have got hunted by it every single day because constantly the media will come back to him. ‘You’re losing again today, is it because of the system?’",
      "\"I think he should have said, 'Listen, I prefer a 3-4-3 system. I had a lot of success with it. I know it can work. I'm going to try to make it work at Manchester United. However, I need to have a look at the squad first. I need to look at how I can best use the players and utilise their strengths because that's what you need to do. And I need to get to know the Premier League and the opponents and everything.'",
      "\"There's so many variables that have an effect on whether that system is going to work or not,\" Meulensteen continued. \"So if he would have done that, he would have been more flexible in getting to grips with the size of the task anyway, never mind losing or winning games. Now, when you win games, things become easier, because you can get your message across easier.\"",
      "\"It is hard to say what kind of advice you would give him, because if he diverts from that, he sees it as a weakness,\" Meulensteen added. \"So that's why he's been, maybe, stubborn and stuck to it . 'I'm going to make it work, no matter what.'",
      "\"I don't think it would be a sign of weakness. He comes across a lot of times as very, very honest. Why couldn't you say, 'Listen I know I've said this. However, the experiences I've had over the last few months make me rethink and review. I genuinely believe that it is in the best interests of all of us–the team, the squad–-that I tweak a few things.'",
      "\"He has tweaked a few things, when he's played Garnacho in that number eight role on the left-hand side. He gave him the leeway to go to the wide areas because that's where Garnacho's strength is, and then run at people and come inside.",
      "\"I also do think that you never should stick yourself to one particular system, because a system is nothing else than a framework. How you're going to start the game. The moment the whistle goes, a 4-4-2 flows into a 4-3-3, a 2-4-4, however the game pans out. So that is not the most important thing.\"",
      "Regardless of whether Amorim makes a tactical switch or not, United are facing a crucial summer transfer window as they gear up for next season without the prospect of European football. The club have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are targeting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo."

      "Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres has regularly been linked with a move but United could face competition from Arsenal. Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo has also emerged as a major target but Thomas Frank’s impending move to Tottenham could throw a spanner into the works.",

      "Man United’s hopes of signing Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres have been handed a huge boost. According to L’Equipe, Saudi side Al-Hilal made a move for the forward after being turned down by Napoli’s Victor Osimhen.",
      "It is suggested that they offered him a £30m-a-year deal to move to the Middle East. They also indicated to Sporting Lisbon that they would be willing to pay around £55m.",
      "But Gyokeres turned down that offer and remains keen on staying in Europe for the foreseeable future. United remain firmly in the race for his signature, alongside Arsenal and Chelsea.",

      "The Swede has just helped them land the domestic double and, after choosing to remain last summer, had an agreement with them that they would let him depart for significantly less than his release clause. Whilst they've honoured that Sporting have still be asking for more than he expected.",
      "The Lisbon outfit have been demanding £67million for him. Previously they agreed that they would demand £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons this summer - meaning they asked for almost £10m more, reports Record. It has left Gyokeres fuming and he's removed the club's name from his social media platforms.",
      "The player has already turned down a potential move to Saudi Arabia after Al-Hilal saw a £55million offer rejected. He is the latest striker to rebuff the Middle East league with Manchester United and Arsenal still keen.",

      "Al-Hilal, who have just appointed for Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi as manager, had been looking to land Victor Osimhen. However the Nigerian knocked them back after his loan stint at Galatasaray with his parent club, Napoli, looking to cash in. That led the Saudis to turn their attention to Gyokeres but the Swedish frontman has also said no to a lucrative offer. He could've earned an annual salary of £30m but wants to continue competing in Europe, reports L'Equipe.",

      "The Portuguese boss is looking to bolster his forward line and could pursue a reunion with Gyokeres. It is understood that Sporting would sanction his sale for around £60m - despite looking for more so far this window - and the player himself is open to the move despite them not having Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal have been touted as his other option. It is well documented that the Gunners want a No.9 but their preference looks to be Benjamin Sesko at RB Leipzig with discussions ongoing over a move for the Slovenian. Gyokeres himself has remained coy on his own future.",

      "The late Brian Clough once punched Roy Keane in the dressing room, but that did not stop the fiery Manchester United legend from loving him. Before he became the explosive Red Devils captain that won everything there was to win, Keane played under Clough at Nottingham Forest, where he received the iconic manager's own brand of tough love.",
      "The two-time European Cup winner was the man who brought Keane to England, signing the Irishman from Cobh Ramblers in 1990. Keane quickly rose to prominence as one of the most promising young talents in European football.",
      "His journey under Clough was marked by many hard and, at times, physical lessons. One of those was brutally inflicted after an FA Cup third-round replay against Crystal Palace in 1991, where Keane made an error that led to them drawing at the City Ground.",
      "Reflecting on Clough's unique approach to management during a recent appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"He (Clough) played mind games sometimes. If you got beaten, you'd think he's going to go after you and then he'd go the other way and go, 'Have a few days off.'",
      "\"If you'd won a few, you'd be going, 'Listen, (I think we'll be getting) a couple of days off' and he'd be like, 'No, you're all in tomorrow.' He'd definitely be playing mind games.\"",
      "Keane reminisced about a stunning incident involving him and former team-mate Mark Crossley, who is widely known as 'Big Norm' around football. Keane turned to Crossley and added: \"We (had) the incident with me, you and the Crystal Palace goal where he punched me after the game. He'd give me days off and he'd be brilliant.\"",
      "One of Keane's worst moments as a player came in the final minutes of that FA Cup clash, when his short back-pass resulted in Crossley fluffing a clearance to Palace star John Salako, who proceeded to lob in an equaliser to force another FA Cup replay.",
      "At the time, penalty shootouts were not part of the FA Cup, so Keane's error meant Forest had to face Palace in the competition for the third time that season. Re-living that painful moment, Keane added: \"I'm looking and it was honestly like slow motion. You know about not upsetting the manager because we all loved Brian Clough. He gave us a chance like Norm did for me.",
      "\"I remember John Salako got it and I'm looking at Norm running back. John Salako, what would he have been? Forty-five yards out? (I thought) 'Norm get back. He's f***ing not getting there'. I swear, as soon as I heard it hit the net...",
      "\"He (Clough) blamed me for the back pass and it was the cup game. So then we went to a replay and he wanted the game done and dusted there. I think it ended up going to, three replays or something.",
      "\"So he (Clough) had the thought of having a free weekend and was going, 'Now I've got to go to London, all the way to London to play Palace in the cup game that we hadn't won.' So he blamed me after the match.\"",
      "Turning to Crossley, Keane said: \"I don't think you said much after the game. You just let me take the wrap for it. He (Clough) just punched me in the chest.\"",
      "Keane made 148 appearances at Forest between 1990 and 1993. He eventually left for United in a then British record £3.75million deal.",

      "“But is he one of those players where once the fans start singing his name and he looks the part, does he then come off the pace and think, I've made it, I've got the shirt?",
      "“I think that's what happened when he was at United, in my eyes. He thought he’d made it as the top player and just started to stroll around, doing what he wanted. That’s what it looked like.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo was in tears once again as he celebrated winning his third trophy with Portugal, who defeated Spain in a penalty shootout to win the Nations League on Sunday. While Portugal have won the Nations League twice, their Euro 2016 triumph was unexpectedly sealed by Premier League flop Eder.",
      "The former Swansea forward came off the bench and stunned France with a long-range effort in extra time, a goal that would later leave Ronaldo crying in celebration. Eder had been shipped out to Lille after just half a season with the Swans, where he had failed to score in 15 appearances.",
      "Having rebuilt his reputation with the French side, the then-28-year-old forced his way into Fernanndo Santos’ squad after scoring six goals in 14 games. Becoming Portugal’s hero must have felt a long way off for Eder while the £5million signing was struggling in South Wales. However, Eder later revealed that he gained the confidence to score Portugal’s 109th-minute winner after a pep talk from Ronaldo as he waited to enter the pitch.",
      "Ronaldo had limped off injured after 25 minutes, but remained a significant presence throughout the game. He spoke to team-mates and patrolled the touchline alongside Santos as he looked to inspire Portugal to victory. It seemed to have the desired effect on Eder.",
      "“Cristiano told me that I would score when I came on and I just took that energy into my game,” Eder said after the final whistle. “We weren’t the best technical team, but we worked for each other. Since the coach arrived he believed this group could do this.\"",
      "Portugal defied the odds throughout the tournament, having remarkably reached the knockout stages courtesy of three draws in the group stage. An extra-time victory over Croatia and penalty shootout drama against Poland led to their only win in 90 minutes over Wales in the semi-finals. However, the manner of Portugal’s Euro 2016 mattered little to Ronaldo.",
      "\"Very happy, very happy,\" he said in the aftermath. \"It was something I tried for so many times since 2004, praying that I would get one more opportunity. The Portuguese people needed it and the players needed it.",
      "\"It is one of the happiest moments of my career. I won so many things with my club, individually. I always said that I wanted to win a championship with the Portugal team, to make history, And I won.\"",
      "Eder joined Lille permanently that summer and retired in 2022 following stints at Lokomotiv Moscow and Saudi Arabian club Al Raed. Meanwhile, at 40 years old, Ronaldo is captain of his country and got on the scoresheet in his team’s hard-fought win over Spain to win the Nations League for a second time following their inaugural victory in 2019.",
      "Spain’s Martin Zubimendi had opened the scoring, but Nuno Mendes quickly cancelled out his effort. Spain regained the lead through Mikel Oyarzabal before Ronaldo levelled the tie just after the hour mark. The Al-Nassr forward, who later confirmed he will not be moving clubs this summer, was taken off shortly before extra time.",
      "This meant, like Euro 2016, Ronaldo had to watch from the sidelines as the drama unfolded. Ruben Neves scored the decisive penalty, capitalising on Alvaro Morata's miss, as Portugal scored with all five of their spot kicks. After the match, Ronaldo expressed his delight at securing another international trophy.",
      "“It’s always special to lift trophies. Regardless of the fact that we’ve already won this competition, for me it’s like it’s the first,\" Ronaldo said. \"You know how passionate I am about being here, about playing for the national team, about wearing my colours. The suffering, the tears. It’s special.",
      "\"For our nation, for the Portuguese people here in the stadium, those who are in Portugal cheering for us... My children are Spanish, so they shout ‘Spain’ to make me angry. So it’s special and I’m very happy.",
      "\"Winning for Portugal is always special. I've won a lot of things, but there's nothing like winning for the national team. That's why I really wanted it. I even said at lunch that this generation deserved it and that we were going to win the final.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult, against a team like Spain , and I think we deserved it. This gives us confidence to go to the World Cup and see that it's possible to beat any team in the world.\"",

      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has been told to shut his mouth and \"get on with it\" by England icon Chris Waddle. Garnacho has endured a turbulent period at United in recent times.",
      "A chequered pattern of behavioural issues with former boss Erik ten Hag has been swiftly followed by periods out of the team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Waddle has hinted that Garnacho, 20, might not yet be as good as he thinks he is, suggesting even a change of clubs may not iron out the issues plaguing the forward. The Newcastle United legend argued that despite his potential, Garnacho should put his head down and focus squarely on his football as rumours swirl about a possible departure from Old Trafford.",
      "\"I was surprised they left him out of the Europa League final because I think attacking Tottenham is the best way of getting results,\" Waddle, 64, told online-casinos.com.",
      "\"And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "\"And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don't know, modern players, I don't know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren't playing.\"",
      "He continued: \"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn't. Garnacho talks like he's got a million games under his belt.",
      "\"We know he's a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they're on the bench, well, that's a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "\"He's a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he's a senior player in his late 20s, but right now he's still learning. There's talk of him going to Italy – let's see how that goes for him.\"",
      "Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea and Italian side Napoli, who made a bid for the player during the January transfer window. Saudi Pro League team Al-Nassr are also reportedly monitoring Garnacho as a potential alternative to Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "However, the player himself has confirmed that he is currently in Italy. He posted a photo of himself outside the Colosseum in Rome, sparking rumours that he could be eyeing a move to Serie A.",
      "Garnacho has netted 26 goals in 144 appearances for United. Nonetheless, if he decides to part ways with United, he still has some time to secure his next move as the summer transfer window will briefly close on June 10, before reopening from June 16 until September 1."

      "Ex-Premier League referee Uriah Rennie is remembered not just for breaking racial barriers in English football, but for his presence, poise and occasional physical authority during high-stakes matches. The trailblazing official, who died aged 65 on Sunday, was once forced to step in to physically restrain Roy Keane during a heated clash between Manchester United and Sunderland in August 2002.",
      "The fixture turned volatile when Keane, under intense scrutiny following his explosive World Cup walk-out that summer, got into a fiery confrontation with Ireland team-mate Jason McAteer.",
      "Throughout the match, the pair had been dishing out tough tackles and verbal jabs, with Liverpool-born McAteer mocking Keane's newly released autobiography.",
      "Tempers flared quickly, and soon the situation threatened to spiral out of control. Spotting \"fury\" in Keane's eyes after a coming together between the players, Rennie stepped in to calm him down. A martial arts expert, the referee didn't hesitate, earning a degree of respect from the notoriously hard-to-please United skipper in the process.",
      "In his 2022 book Your Show, a novelisation of his refereeing career, Rennie recalled the tense moment with vivid detail. \"They both tumble onto the turf. Limbs flailing. Elbows and knees,\" he wrote. \"Roy's reacting now, fury in his eyes, head's gone. This feud has history... grab Roy, save Jason?\"",
      "Rennie's instincts then took over. \"Only a moment to think. You take matters in your own giant black hands with a cliff-edged ­fearlessness. You get in between the two. You do what you have to do, to stop it escalating, from turning into a 20-man mass brawl,\" he explained. \"You grab Roy, grip onto his shirt like you did a few ­seasons ago at White Hart Lane, but tighter.\"",
      "His intervention was effective. Keane, visibly seething, was separated from McAteer. Both players, in their own way, acknowledged the impact – McAteer later admitted that Keane would have \"ripped his head off\" if Rennie hadn't come between them. Keane, though never one to show deference, seemed to develop a level of respect for the referee's fearless handling of the moment.",
      "However, just minutes later, Keane lashed out again – this time catching McAteer with a sharp elbow to the back of the head. Rennie immediately issued a red card – a decision so clear-cut that even Sir Alex Ferguson didn't contest it.",
      "\"The referee had no choice but to send him off,\" the legendary United manager said after the game. \"Roy is the first United player to be sent off for this offence and I have said recently the use of the elbow is a growing problem in our game.\" He later confirmed that the club would not appeal the decision and had fined Keane £150,000.",
      "Rennie admitted his handling of the situation went beyond standard procedure: \"I didn't follow FA protocol,\" he wrote. \"You throw away the rule book and intervene early with action, words won’t do, stopping Keane from doing something he shouldn't.",
      "\"You stare Keane dead in the eyes, still clutching a fistful of his shirt... messy Irish ­history. Messy World Cup history. Keane is fiddling with his captain's armband as you ­reason with him. He's only half listening, facing you but eyeing up the Sunderland player who has retreated behind you to safety. Although he might not be showing it now, maybe in his own way, he respects you.\"",
      "Despite being sent off, Keane remained unapologetic. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in 2023, he insisted McAteer \"deserved\" the elbow and that the two were \"absolutely not\" on speaking terms. \"He was one of those players who couldn't stop running their mouths,\" Keane said. \"I didn't mind lads kicking me or booting me but McAteer as usual had plenty to say for himself.\"",
      "McAteer, who had also played for Liverpool, Bolton, and Blackburn, later described their relationship as \"toxic.\" He didn't hold back in his own assessment, calling Keane a \"clown\" and telling him to \"bore off.\""

      "Rasmus Hojlund looks set to stay at Manchester United with clubs struggling to meet the Red Devils’ demands. The Danish forward was linked with a move away from Old Trafford after an awful season.",
      "Hojlund scored just four Premier League goals for United last term, leading to suggestions that the former Atalanta striker could return to Italy. Inter Milan were among the sides linked with him, while Juventus and Napoli were also credited with interest.",
      "But it appears that a move to Serie A is no longer an option according to reports. According to suggestions in Italy, United’s demands of a permanent Deal have made a move very difficult.",
      "It is reported that United want to receive around £40m for the 22-year-old, a deal that the Italian sides would struggle to put together. They would only be able to sign him on loan as it stands.",
      "Hojlund has recently spoken out on his future at Old Trafford and confirmed that he was looking to stay with the club. He said: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",
      "\"I know I can't get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I'm just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.\"",
      "In all, Hojlund has made 95 appearances for United since his £72m move from Atalanta. In that time, he has scored just 26 goals. Former Red Devils star Phil Jones has suggested that a move away from the club might be best for his career.",
      "He said: \"It’s a difficult one, I feel really sorry for him (Hojlund). It's obviously been a difficult season for him, but I always find it's difficult for a No. 9 in a difficult season.",
      "\"He's probably not getting the chances, you know, the seven, eight chances a game. He's feeding off one or two that might come into him in the 70th minute, and he's got to produce.",
      "\"It hasn't quite happened for him yet. It's been difficult for him, but I think if he were to move on, he would probably benefit from that. A bit like Marcus (Rashford), it's a fresh start for him.",
      "\"It's a difficult one for Rasmus Hojlund. What I would say is, I think that Man United will be looking for another No. 9. Maybe that would take a bit of the pressure off him as well if he can manage his minutes between the two No. 9s.\""

      "The start of Manchester United's pre-season campaign will be here before we know it.",
      "United are scheduled to play the opening game of their pre-season programme on Saturday, July 19, facing Leeds United in Stockholm. They will then travel to the United States for their pre-season tour a few days later.",
      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "Slowly but surely an image of how Manchester United could line up at the start of next season is developing.",
      "Just over a week into the first stage of the summer transfer window and United have already wrapped up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha. They have now set their sights on attempting to lure Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford as well.",
      "To say United have made an ambitious start to head coach Ruben Amorim's first summer at the helm is an understatement. Cunha has arrived in M16 on the back of a 17-goal season in all competitions and Mbeumo netted 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Identified as a top target several months ago, Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford with the task of almost certainly filling the left-sided No.10 position. If Mbeumo is successfully drafted in, it is thought he will occupy the right-sided No.10 position.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning their decision to try and bolster their attack as their first port of call this summer is a wise one.",
      "Cunha, and possibly Mbeumo, would immediately add the goals that have been missing in previous seasons. Between them, they have plundered 56 goals between them since the beginning of the 2023/24 Premier League campaign.",
      "In addition to adding goals to the team, Cunha and Mbeumo would also strengthen the levels of competition for places. Despite Amorim often struggling to find a consistent and productive attack this term, it was not through a lack of options.",
      "United have a cluster of players who are capable of playing in either of the two No.10 positions: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee, Cunha and Amad.",
      "With Garnacho facing the prospect of being sold and Fernandes looking increasingly likely to be deployed as a No.8 next season amid Cunha's arrival, the size of that list will reduce, meaning Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Cunha, Amad and potentially Mbeumo will all be challenging to start in the two No.10 positions.",
      "Of course, each of those players are versatile to some degree but the majority will believe that is their best position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "If Mbeumo signs, Amad is highly likely to be installed as United's first-choice right wing-back and operate from out wide. However, Mainoo and Mount will be less assured of regular starting berths.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to force his way into the starting XI this calendar year, with his one-minute cameo against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final feeling rather telling about where he currently sits in Amorim's plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Mount started the last four games of the season, including the Europa League final. Amorim is a massive fan of the former Chelsea man.",
      "\"I'm so happy for him,\" Amorim said after Mount scored twice in United's 4-1 win over Athletic Club last month. \"He is such a player. He works really hard, he has quality.",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him.\"",
      "The fact he started the final four games of the season as one of the two No.10s confirmed once and for all just how highly Amorim rates him. Injuries, however, plagued his first two seasons at the club, restricting him to just 46 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Well-versed in a three at the back formation from his Chelsea days, it is understandable why Amorim is so fond of the 26-year-old. He is a tailor-made fit for his system and his understanding of what to do and where to be when United don't have possession is admirable.",
      "However, if United land Mbeumo, it is hard to see where Mount fits into Amorim's first-choice starting XI. Mbeumo and Cunha would occupy the two spots reserved for the No.10s and Mount is not a central-midfielder in this system.",
      "Competition for places is healthy and should never be frowned upon, but one of Amorim's most valued players may have to settle for a place on the bench."

      "The prospect of Manchester United playing as few as 40 games next season means head coach Ruben Amorim will not have to rotate quite as frequently as he did last season.",
      "United's failure to qualify for the Champions League via the Europa League means they will only have domestic matters to focus on in 2025/26 in the form of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the League Cup.",
      "Not since 2014/15 have United had a season without European football. They successfully managed to get back into the Champions League for 2015/16 that season by securing a top four finish.",
      "Once again, United's main objective next season has to be securing European football for 2026/27. European participation brings a whole host of benefits, not least financially.",
      "However, one of the biggest advantages of United being out of Europe next season is that Amorim will not have as congested a fixture schedule to deal with, meaning there will be a lot of free midweeks to spend on the training ground.",
      "As encouraging as that could be as a collective, some individuals may find game time much harder to come by. United need to reduce the size of their squad and a whole host of departures are expected.",
      "However, the bulk of the exits United are planning for are in the attacking department, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony being identified as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho has also been told he can leave for the right price.",
      "The prospect of each member of that aforementioned quartet being sold will generate funds for United to reinvest elsewhere in the squad. They plan to sign Bryan Mbeumo, a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "One area which is not expected to be strengthened, though, is the centre-back department. After signing Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro last summer and then Ayden Heaven in February, United are very well stocked at the back.",
      "Despite the impending exits of out-of-contract duo Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, United still have five first-team centre-backs they can all upon in the shape of Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, De Ligt, Yoro and Heaven. Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw are also equally comfortable operating in the back-three.",
      "Injury issues meant United didn't finish the 2024/25 campaign with a settled defence, meaning pre-season is set to determine who will make up Amorim's first-choice back-three come the start of the new campaign in August.",
      "Amorim could find himself with four players believing they are worthy of occupying the left-sided centre-back spot. Martinez, both before and after United switched to a back-three, was the club's main left-sided centre-back.",
      "However, his season-ending ACL injury meant the position was occupied by several different faces in the second half of the season, including Yoro, Heaven and Shaw.",
      "Despite originally being signed to operate as the right-sided centre-back in a back-four, United's mid-season shift to a back-three was expected to see Yoro become Amorim's first-choice option on the right of his three-man defence. However, the Frenchman arguably produced his best performances for United so far on the opposite side of the defence.",
      "\"[Being] right footed is more easy for me sometimes on the right, but I really like to play on the left,\" Yoro said earlier this year. \"When I go inside, I can put a long ball to the striker, or in the middle, so I like both sides. It's no problem for me.\"",
      "Yoro has the capacity to become a staple in United's defence for many years to come, likewise Heaven, who has not put a foot wrong since arriving from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "Martinez will be hungry to reclaim the left-sided centre-back spot and make up for lost time once he recovers from his injury. He was just getting to grips with the demands of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system prior to his injury and will be keen to demonstrate his ball-playing credentials.",
      "If he can stay fit, Shaw will also be keen to muscle in on the conversation for a starting berth. Now that United operate with wing-backs, his main route into the team is at centre-back.",
      "With no obvious winner, pre-season could decide who wins the race to become Amorim's first-choice left-sided centre-back."

      "Not being able to offer European football means a potential deal has been complicated. But should his situation get advanced with another club, United will reportedly remain informed as they are in contact with his camp.",
      "While Gyokeres does remain on the shortlist for the Reds, they will likely need to fund some transfers, with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Jadon Sancho among the contenders to leave this summer.",
      "According to Portuguese outlet Record, the Swede has been 'left angered' by the Lions, who are holding out for €80m (£67.5m) from interested clubs – like United, Arsenal and Chelsea this summer. Record state that Sporting initially wanted €60m (£50m) up front, with €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, but now they've moved the goalposts.",
      "It's believed that the Portuguese outfit are now asking for €80m (£67.5m), which hasn't gone down well with the striker.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper A Bola, Gyokeres has made it clear he intends to leave Estadio Jose Alvalade this summer. He reportedly believes that, after his contributions over the past couple of years, his departure would not harm Sporting.",
      "Despite receiving 'better proposals' last summer, the Swede chose to remain in Lisbon. Now, at 27, he is said to feel that the time is right to take the next step in his career.",
      "As a result, Gyokeres has taken 'Sporting' out of his Instagram profile. Previously, he had all references to Sporting and Sweden on his Instagram bio.",
      "But now it merely states that he is a 'Sportsperson'.",
      "A special and historic welcome gift could be enough to tempt Gyokeres to M16. One potential bonus the club may offer is the historic number nine shirt.",
      "It has been worn by a number of club icons including Sir Bobby Charlton, Andy Cole, Dimitar Berbatov and more. The No.9 shirt is currently being used by Rasmus Hojlund - who has endured a torrid time since he arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth up to £72million and has himself been linked with a move away from the club this summer, which would leave the number free for Gyokeres' potential arrival.",
      "According to FootMercato, Gyokeres is a 'priority target' for Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal. The report says that the striker is 'actively followed' by the club.",
      "Their interest comes after Victor Osimhen turned down a move to the Middle East. It was reported over the weekend that Al-Hilal has scheduled a medical after a £63m deal was agreed, but the player rejected the move despite a lucrative deal being on the table.",
      "The Saudi Pro League outfit have now been left looking for an alternative option and Gyokeres has emerged as a target. They are reported to be eager to back new manager Simone Inzaghi in the summer transfer window following his move from Inter Milan."

      "Arsenal’s panic over one big deal being hijacked was unfounded, but the Gunners are struggling to sign a striker having finally identified the one they want…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma sees Old Trafford as a ‘tempting destination’, does he? Or is it that the Italy keeper has been in contract talks with PSG for months and he isn’t getting what he wants so his representatives are pulling the oldest trick in the agents’ book? You decide.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Heung-min Son – Tottenham Hotspur to Al-Hilal\nThe Saudi Arabian club are desperate to make a statement signing and the Spurs captain could be perfect. He’s out of contract next summer as well.",
      "",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Bayer Leverkusen\nThere was talk of interest from Newcastle, which was a move we could really get on board with. But a loan with a £67milion obligation always seemed a little fanciful on City’s part. A £40million deal to replace Florian Wirtz at Leverkusen seems more like the kind of fee City would take for a player with no future under Guardiola, but we’d still rather Grealish stuck around in the Premier League.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "16) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "15) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Indeed, the Blues won’t pay half that, and they have apparently threatened to walk away if the deal isn’t done before the pre-Club World Cup deadline. Which isn’t really the threat Chelsea might think it is.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "11) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "9)  Kevin De Bruyne – Manchester City to Napoli\nThere was a hitch around image rights last week but, apparently, that has been resolved and De Bruyne is set to sign a two-year contract to fulfil his dream of playing with Scott McTominay.",
      "",
      "8) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nChelsea’s first offer of £30million was rejected, with Dortmund wanting £40million, and the Germans know the Blues can be squeezed as the pre-Club World Cup deadline looms. A seven-year contract is reportedly on the table for the winger.",
      "",
      "7) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool have improved on their opening bid of £109million by returning with an extra £4million. Leverkusen, as they should, are still haggling but the Reds are close. They’re hardly likely to walk away over a few euros and leave Wirtz hanging. The player will be looking for progress this week now there’s no international distraction.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "",
      "6) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "5) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein says it’s done.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jobe Bellingham – Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund\nA very on-brand deal has been agreed to make Jude’s little bro the second-most expensive player in Dortmund’s history. Jobe is apparently in Germany to drop his trousers and cough for the Dortmund doc and, all being well, he’ll be unveiled in the coming days.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity have agreements with Cherki and Lyon and they are in a hurry so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed this week.",
      "",
      "1) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season."

      "Man Utd were arguably even worse under Amorim with the current squad struggling to get to grips with his style of play, tactics and philosophy.",
      "Ten Hag had a reputation of bringing in players from the Netherlands at Man Utd or players who had links to Eredivisie side Ajax, who he managed before the Red Devils.",
      "The former Man Utd boss signed Andre Onana, Matthijs De Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, Antony and Noussair Mazraoui, who all played for him at Ajax.",

      "These 10 Premier League players probably won’t be at the 2026 World Cup if they don’t move clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",
      "Is he joining Liverpool? No but…",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",
      "Move to a bigger club, play more consistently, even just slightly up his game – and Pedro could be leading the line for Brazil next summer.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "",
      "Federico Chiesa (Liverpool and Italy)\nThere is no chance Chiesa makes it to the World Cup if 2025/26 is anything like his miserable debut season at Liverpool. Fourteen appearances. Four starts. Arne Slot’s side won the title at a canter and barely needed him.",
      "A serious knee injury after Euro 2020 prevented Chiesa from kicking on when he was being touted as one of the best wingers in the world. There was talk of a £100m move to the Premier League but he ended up joining Liverpool for around £12.5m in 2024.",
      "He’s now a shadow of his former self, and rotting on the bench helps nobody. Not him. Not Italy. He needs to accept defeat – urgently.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot (Manchester United and Portugal)\nDalot’s slipped down the pecking order at United following Erik ten Hag’s departure – not because of favouritism, but because he simply doesn’t suit Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back formation.",
      "His form has nosedived. There’s more room for improvement here than with most others on this list, but if he’s not trusted as a wing-back and can’t play centre-back, he’s going to spend a lot of time on the bench.",
      "United are open to selling anyone. They’d have flogged Bruno Fernandes if he’d been willing to move to Saudi Arabia. With a World Cup looming, this summer is pivotal for Dalot and friends.",
      "",
      "Niclas Fullkrug (West Ham and Germany)\nLike Pedro and Brazil, the No.9 spot is there for the taking for Germany. Kai Havertz is a shoo-in as things stand – and that’s not even his natural position. Then again, what is?",
      "West Ham’s 2024/25 season was a disaster. Fullkrug’s assessment of their “s**t” performances was the most entertainment they offered. The German needs service to score – and hasn’t had any. He didn’t adapt, and poor seasons from Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and co. didn’t help.",
      "A swift return to the Bundesliga could be perfect. He scored 12 and assisted eight in 29 league games for Borussia Dortmund in 2023/24, and has 14 goals in 22 caps for Germany. If he stays at West Ham, the only justification for calling him up would be that goal record.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool and England)\nGomez feels like a stellar squad player option for England, but even that might be out of reach if he spends another season doing next to nothing at Liverpool.",
      "It’s a surprise he hasn’t pushed for a move already. There’s no sign of him flying up Arne Slot’s defensive pecking order – not as a right-back, centre-back or left-back. That versatility makes him valuable for club and country. But not if no-one’s using it.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho (Manchester United and England)\nBack to square one, then? Where does Sancho go from here? A permanent exit from Manchester United is inevitable, but who’s going to take him?",
      "Swallowing his pride and moving to a West Ham or Crystal Palace might be his best option in the Premier League – they can offer European football, which United can’t. But it might be smarter to head abroad again. Borussia Dortmund gave him a lifeline and he repaid them by helping them reach a Champions League final. Maybe they’ll do him a favour again.",
      "Either way, Sancho needs to be playing regularly and impressively if he wants even a sniff of a World Cup return. Right now, he’s not even in the conversation.",

      "Man Utd have initiated “new contacts” as they “call again” to get a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres over the line, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are desperate to sign a new striker this summer after struggling to score goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term as they finished 15th under Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund scored just seven Premier League goals between them and the Red Devils are looking for a proven goalscorer to lead the line.",
      "Improving their attack in general has been the focus of their early summer business with Matheus Cunha signing from Wolves for £62.5m, while they have had two bids rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "They had been keen on signing Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap but Chelsea beat them to the Englishman and now Man Utd are now looking at different options.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd used by CL winner but forward offers boost",
      "A move for Gyokeres had been seen as unlikely after they failed to qualify for the Champions League but journalist Ben Jacobs recently claimed the Sweden international would be ‘keen’ on a move to Old Trafford regardless.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",
      "And now transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that he is “99 per cent convinced” that Man Utd would have had a deal wrapped up by now for Gyokeres if they’d qualified for the Champions League.",
      "But the Italian reporter insists that Arsenal’s decision to go after Benjamin Sesko, rather than Gyokeres, has given Man Utd an opportunity again.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Gyokeres was and remains an option for Arsenal in terms of new striker. Because at the moment my information is Arsenal are advancing on the deal for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“So Sesko is the clear favourite, there are conversations ongoing. But it’s still not a done deal. So until the Sesko deal is a done we have to be careful.",
      "“At the moment Sesko remains the favourite, Viktor Gyokeres remains the other option on the table, but as it’s now two or three weeks that Arsenal are still not advancing on the Gyokeres deal, all the other clubs keep calling his agents.",
      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly ‘furious’ over a broken transfer ‘promise’ as Sporting Lisbon have set a new ‘demand’ for the Manchester United target.",

      "The Swedish international is a frontrunner to be this year’s top scorer in Europe and he’s attracted interest from several sides in recent months.",
      "Man Utd and Arsenal have been the main Premier League clubs in the running to land Gyokeres, but the Red Devils appear to be more likely to sign the forward as the Gunners are currently pursuing RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Gyokeres could join the two No.10s in signing for Man Utd, but they have hurdles to overcome to sign the prolific striker.",
      "In recent months, it’s been reported that he has a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to leave Sporting Lisbon for a set fee in the region of €70m (£59m), but a new report in Portugal claims they have instead decided to hold out for a higher price.",
      "This is according to Portuguese outlet Record, who claim Gyokeres is ‘furious’ at this latest development.",
      "It was previously ‘agreed’ that his €100m release clause would ‘not be an obstacle’ and he ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "However, Sporting chiefs are ‘not respecting’ these set terms and are ‘demanding a higher amount’ than that was initially ‘stipulated’ as they want €80m for their prized asset.",
      "‘This has not gone down well’ with Gyokeres as he ‘believes that the club is failing to deliver on what it promised at the beginning of the season’.",
      "The report also lifts the lid on a previous meeting between Gyokeres and the club’s hierarchy.",
      "‘Another source close to the process confirmed that at the beginning of the season there was a meeting between Frederico Varandas and Sporting’s former football director, Hugo Viana, with Gyökeres and his agent, in which it was explained to the player that the club would not demand the value of the termination clause due to his age (at the time of the events, 26 years old), without the president of the lions having set a value to release him.",
      "‘The same source added that, to date, Sporting has not received any official offer for the forward.’",

And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "“And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don’t know, modern players, I don’t know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren’t playing.",
      "“Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn’t. Garnacho talks like he’s got a million games under his belt.",

      "“He’s a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he’s a senior player in his late twenties, but right now he’s still learning. There’s talk of him going to Italy – let’s see how that goes for him.”",

      "Tah has joined Vincent Kompany’s side on a free transfer, prompting Bayern to look to move Kim on.",
      "That’s according to The Boot Room journalist Graeme Bailey, who reports the 28-year-old has been ‘offered’ to several Premier League clubs.",
      "It’s claimed that United, Tottenham, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle are all ‘aware that Kim could be available this summer’.",

      "19) Marco Verratti (Al-Arabi)\nWill he take more money in the Middle East or head back to Europe for a final hurrah?",

      "",
      "16) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "15) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He claims he is staying in Saudi.",
      "",
      "14) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "13) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",

      "8) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, and it looks like it might earn him a move to Strasbourg, though Burnley are keen to sign him on again.",

      "6) Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\nApparently set to sign a new one-year contract and potentially play in the World Cup at the age of 38/39.",

      "3) Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nNapoli looks the likeliest destination as the Premier League’s assist king is not ready to be put out to MLS pasture just yet.",
      "",
      "2) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March. But the two parties are far enough apart to apparently alert Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",

      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho is nearing the exit door as he has fallen out with Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim and needs a fresh start elsewhere.",
      "The talented winger endured a difficult season in 2024/25 and dropped out of United‘s squad for December’s Manchester derby, with Amorim citing his poor performance/attitude in training.",
      "Marcus Rashford was also omitted and while he was sent on loan to Aston Villa in January, Garnacho returned to the Man Utd fold and was a bit-part player for the Premier League giants during the run-in.",
      "Garnacho is one of United’s most dangerous attacking players, but his poor decision-making let him down under Amorim and he’s also not suited to the No.10 role in the head coach’s preferred 3-4-3 system.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: New Man Utd fear; Chelsea, City deadline looms",
      "The 20-year-old’s position became untenable after he fired a dig at Amorim and Man Utd after he only made a brief cameo off the bench in the Europa League final, with it later reported that he’s been told to ‘find a new club’.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli were mooted as possible destinations for Garnacho in January as Man Utd looked to offload valuable talents to raise funds.",
      "Over the weekend, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano provided an update on Garnacho’s future, claiming three Premier League clubs have ‘called’ to confirm their interest.",
      "Romano revealed: ‘Alejandro Garnacho will leave Man United, decision confirmed on player and club side — set to part ways.",
      "‘Understand staying in Premier League serious option with 3 clubs already very keen… after Bayer Leverkusen and Italian clubs calling.’",
      "The identity of these Premier League clubs was initially unclear, but journalist Gaston Edul claims Arsenal and Chelsea are two of them, while he’s also revealed the winger’s “preference”.",
      "He said: “Two of the three clubs that enquired about Garnacho are Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "“Garnacho has a preference to stay in the Premier League.”",
      "Arsenal’s main priority is to sign a striker, but they are also in the market for a winger as they need competition/an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli.",
      "Garnacho would not be a clear upgrade on Martinelli currently and this supposed transfer would not go down well. He would fall on his feet if he lands at Arsenal, with former England international Chris Waddle claiming he needs to “shut up”.",
      "Waddle explained: “Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn’t.",
      "“Garnacho talks like he’s got a million games under his belt. We know he’s a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they’re on the bench, well, that’s a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it",
      "“He’s a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it.",
      "“He talks like he’s a senior player in his late twenties, but right now he’s still learning. There’s talk of him going to Italy – let’s see how that goes for him.”",

      "While that figure would put the 51-year-old about 56th in a list of the club’s most expensive transfers ever – they once spent more on Clinton N’Jie – the usual reluctance from a club to countenance dropping such sums on a manager means talks may now slow down somewhat.",

      "Brendan Rodgers – £6m\nSwansea felt £5m was “suitable compensation” for “such a talented, young British manager” and three members of his backroom staff when Liverpool came calling in 2012.",
      "Seven years later, Chris Davies and Glen Driscoll again jumped ship with Rodgers for Leicester, but the addition of first-team coach Kolo Toure understandably brought the overall package closer to £10m for a frustrated Celtic.",
      "The appointment of Rodgers alone cost the Foxes £6m as they quickly identified and secured their main target to replace the sacked Claude Puel in February 2019. It immediately felt like a potentially bounteous union and for a long while proved as such.",
      "Rodgers extended his contract before the year was out, with his first two full seasons culminating in almighty bottlings of Champions League qualification after vague threats of title challenges.",
      "There was silverware in the form of the FA Cup and consecutive European campaigns only look more impressive the further Leicester in their current guise spiral out of control.",
      "But it ultimately ended in relegation heartbreak, with Rodgers sacked shortly before a drop into the Championship. The manager was due a pay-off of around £10m but is thought to have foregone some of that payment. Being replaced by Dean Smith does that to a man.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim – £9.25m\nThere was a similar sense with Amorim that Manchester United might have found a perfect match; that feeling lasted about a fortnight.",
      "Amorim had been on the Old Trafford radar for months, including through the hilariously bungled backing and sacking of Erik ten Hag, but it was decided that one final summer transfer window of recruiting at great expense more players specifically wanted by the Dutchman and entirely incompatible with his eventual successor was the best and indeed only possible course of action for a club which believes free lunches, charity work and employing non-footballers to be the problem.",
      "Sporting paid about £8m to release Amorim from his Braga contract after just 13 games in charge in March 2020 and it was a masterstroke: he transformed the Lisbon club to the extent that they won two Primeira Liga crowns after an almost two-decade drought, while putting them on course for a third before his departure.",
      "Manchester United wasted £21.4m on replacing Ten Hag with Amorim in November 2024 after threatening/promising the Portuguese that the opportunity to manage them would not come around again.",
      "Having spent the first eight months of his reign explaining in unnecessarily public and painstaking detail precisely how incompetent he believes himself, his players and the club which has helped torch his burgeoning reputation to be, it is easy to imagine he might regret not calling their bluff.",
      "All manner of low bars were dragged towards the centre of the Earth in an atrocious season which concluded with an embarrassing Europa League final no-show. The manager who so thoroughly out-coached his rival to procure the trophy and Champions League qualification with it was obviously ruthlessly dispensed with soon after; Sunk-Cost Fallacy FC doubled down on failure and rewarded Amorim with a £62.5m signing 11 days later.",
      "",
      "Arne Slot – £9.4m\n“Everybody understands Feyenoord will want to receive as much money as they can get, but I get the feeling that they will not begrudge me this move,” said Slot when it became clear that, through the noise surrounding Amorim and Xabi Alonso, he would be handed the Jurgen Klopp dynasty.",
      "The Eredivisie runners-up were perfectly satisfied with a £7.7m fee and £1.7m in add-ons which might well have been triggered over the course of a Premier League-winning debut season. Liverpool, too, were content with a succession plan which convinced few outside the club.",
      "Among those might well have been Spurs, on whom the joke is contractually bound to always be. They considered the credentials of Slot in The Great Managerial Search of summer 2023, although when it was reported that Feyenoord wanted £15m or so in restitution, it does not requite a vivid imagination to envision Daniel Levy’s non-response.",
      "Slot parlayed that interest into a contract extension after playing Spurs like a fiddle. When it was an upwardly mobile Liverpool on the end of the phone less than a year later, negotiations inevitably went far smoother.",

      "Enzo Maresca – £10m\nLeicester were ‘disappointed’ when Maresca ‘decided at this stage that he no longer wants to be part of our vision,’ but they cannot possibly have been surprised.",
      "The Italian recognised that his stock was high after winning the Championship title; he understandably chose to cash in when Chelsea made an approach for a coach they felt would be more malleable to their unique operations and machinations.",
      "The wheels on the bandwagon felt loose for months after but Maresca and his team managed to stabilise themselves, qualify for the Champions League and win the Europa Conference.",

      "",
      "Andre Villas-Boas – £13.3m\nWith Carlo Ancelotti handed one of the harsher sackings in Premier League history, Chelsea felt it necessary to conduct an absurdly expensive experiment to deduce whether lightning could indeed strike twice.",
      "The hypothesis was fair. The club’s greatest era was triggered in no small part by the prodigious brilliance of a young Portuguese manager who had just won the Treble with Porto. Jose Mourinho himself once referred to Villas-Boas as “my eyes and ears” so when the 33-year-old won the Primeira Liga, Europa League and Portuguese Cup, the comparison became unavoidably intoxicating.",
      "Roman Abramovich certainly agreed, sanctioning what was a world-record compensation package for a manager he would spend about as much to sack within eight months, at least partly because he tried to make John Terry sit in economy.",
      "‘Andre was the outstanding candidate for the job,’ the Blues said when appointing him. By the time he was dispensed with there was ‘disappointment that the relationship has ended so early’ – and presumably so expensively.",
      "",
      "Graham Potter – £21.5m\nIt was presumed that Chelsea’s financially incontinent revolving door managerial policy would end with Abramovich’s ownership, but Clearlake ensured to honour that proud history with their first appointment.",
      "Thomas Tuchel was soon shown the door Potter would be invited through thanks to his work at Brighton. As ever, the Seagulls were fully prepared for such an eventuality and guaranteed they would be reimbursed for their troubles.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi was already in place as Potter’s replacement when it was revealed that Chelsea’s latest direct debit payment to Brighton amounted to just over £21m for the manager and five of his backroom team.",
      "He was probably the best Chelsea manager that season but that only hilariously damns the Blues, who preferred to be dragged into the actual sea by Frank Lampard.",

      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
