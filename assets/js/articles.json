      "Manchester United have a chance to capitalise on their momentum by grabbing a second consecutive win in their derby clash against rivals Manchester City this weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men went into the international break with a hard-earned 3-2 win at home to Burnley but now face a tough test away at the Etihad - though Pep Guardiola's men have shown they have vulnerabilities too.",
      "City have lost two of their first three games this season and are under pressure going into this game, which they cannot afford to lose if they want to keep pace with the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "United won this fixture 2-1 away from home last season - which was his second victory against Guardiola in 2024-25 - so Amorim will be fairly confident of getting a result.",
      "Amorim will certainly be under pressure if he continues to pick up poor results this season, with some pundits claiming he should be axed after guiding the team to a 15th placed finish last season.",
      "United only have one win under the Portuguese boss in 2025-26 and the club's higher-ups will be expecting him to bring in more positive results in due course.",
      "Should Amorim be sacked in the future, there would be a number of top managers linked with the role - including ex-Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who has constantly been rumoured to be a contender in recent years.",
      "But former Burnley, Southampton and QPR star Charlie Austin has offered a more left-field option and tipped his ex-Clarets boss Sean Dyche for the role. He said that Zidane would be his No 1 pick, but if he was not available he'd appoint Dyche because he would give the team \"structure\".",
      "\"I think he's got to go, if it's my decision, I'm going after Zinedine Zidane,\" he said. \"Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you've got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton,\" Austin added. \"For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",
      "Amorim knows he won't have Onana in his squad this weekend after the Cameroonian shot-stopper was granted a loan move to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, with no loan fee or obligation to buy included in the deal.",
      "United signed young keeper Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day and he is now expected to be the club's new No 1.",
      "Onana came under huge pressure during his time at Old Trafford after making a succession of mistakes, including a handful during the team's humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby this season.",
      "He appeared to take a swipe at United after being welcomed in by hordes of Trabzonspor fans this week, admitting he had \"never felt so much love from people around me\".",
      "\"I am very happy. I can say that I am very happy,\" Onana told local outlet 61 Saat. I am starting a new project, a new adventure for me, I am very happy to be here.",
      "\"This is a feeling that makes me so happy. I've never felt so much love from people around me.",
      "\"It's a wonderful feeling to be made to feel at home from the very first moment. I want to start working as soon as possible and reciprocate that love by making them happy on the field.\"",
      "United fans have been crying out for a change in ownership for years after being left seething over the Glazers' running of the club.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since come in after investing around Â£1.3bn to give himself a minority stake in United, but he is yet to convince supporters he can bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.",
      "While the Glazers haven't been popular in Manchester, a number of American-based businessman have had success investing in football club after actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney took Wrexham from non league to the Championship.",
      "Birmingham are also having a resurgence since NFL superstar Tom Brady took them over, helping the club return to the Championship.",
      "Golf legend Woods has been tipped to get involved in a similar football takeover by former Premier League star Matt Jansen, who played for Blackburn, urging him to invest at United.",
      "Fellow former Rovers star Brad Friedel agreed that Woods would be a great asset to United if he decided to go down the ownership route, but urged him to snub United and instead join his former club Liverpool.",
      "\"I saw Matt Jansen say he'd like Tiger Woods to take over Man United,\" the American told Mr-gamble.com. \"I would prefer he does not go to Old Trafford. But it would be brilliant for the Premier League if he did. Go to Liverpool instead, Tiger!\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim have both revealed they'll be missing several key stars for Sunday afternoon's Manchester derby showdown at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "United face fewer headaches, though Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have suffered recent blows. Both players hobbled off during the thrilling 3-2 triumph over Burnley a fortnight ago, while Diogo Dalot withdrew from Portugal duty in September's break.",
      "The trio have been ruled out by Amorim for the cross-city clash. They in turn join Lisandro Martinez in Carrington's medical room at United's Carrington base.",
      "\"They are out for this game, I don't know how long it's going to take,\" Amorim stated in Friday's press conference. \"We need these guys to be a competitive team.",
      "\"We have very good players, who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out.\"",
      "When pressed on the potential length of their absences, Amorim continued: \"I don't want to say. If you talk to Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game. They are pushing really hard.\"",
      "As for City, Guardiola appears set to be without several vital figures. However, the Catalan head coach may also welcome back a crucial trio.",
      "On the brighter side, there, Josko Gvardiol and Savinho have both resumed training lately and might therefore be involved, while Phil Foden is anticipated to be available. The September international break didn't treat Guardiola kindly, with Omar Marmoush picking up an injury while representing Egypt, just days after John Stones had to pull out from the England squad.",
      "The City boss provided updates on these two. He also confirmed other names on the injury list.",
      "\"Omar is injured. Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki [is injured]. The rest are fine,\" he stated on Friday.",
      "\"Stones as well is a doubt. Not a big issue, but he is a doubt for Sunday.\"",
      "When quizzed about how long Marmoush might be side-lined, Guardiola disclosed: \"We have to make the last tests. A few weeks. Before the [October] international break he will be ready.\"",
      "Players like Mateo Kovacic, Marcus Bettinelli, Kalvin Phillips and Abdukodir Khusanov have been nursing injuries recently. However, the latter duo could be fit, having been spotted in training.",

      "Erling Haaland has hit out at his Manchester City teammates for their poor start to the 2025/26 Premier League ahead of this weekend's clash with Manchester United. City have lost two of their first three games and currently sit a frustrating 13th in the top-flight standings.",
      "Last time out, they squandered a lead at Brighton to lose 2-1 after also falling to a 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Pep Guardiola's side had started the season with a 4-0 thrashing of Wolves but they have not once since.",
      "After the first international break of the season, Haaland has labelled their season start as \"not good enough\". This week, City take on United in the first Manchester derby of the season and they will be looking to seek revenge for last season's defeat.",
      "\"We've lost two games in a row, it's not good enough, it's way too bad,\" he told ViaPlay. \"We need to figure it out, get back to winning ways.",
      "\"We can't afford to lose games as there's so many good teams. It's perfect to turn things around against United.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has wasted little time making an impact at Chelsea's Cobham training ground after his move from Manchester United. After signing the winger to a seven-year contract with Stamford Bridge, Blues manager Enzo Maresca didn't hesitate to put Garnacho through his paces.",
      "The Chelsea coaching staff were keen to assess the Argentinian international's fitness, so he was assigned a series of strength and conditioning tasks. Garnacho and compatriot Facundo Buonanotte, who joined the Blues on loan from Brighton on deadline day, began their regime in the gym before joining their new teammates on the pitch.",
      "Once they joined Maresca's squad, the pair were subjected to an intense running drill. In a video shared across the club's social media platforms, Garnacho appeared worn out, but team-mate Wesley Fofana offered little sympathy.",
      "\"Welcome to Chelsea Football Club,\" Fofana told his new colleague, with Garnacho responding: \"I can't move my legs now, man\". The former United winger seems to have settled well in west London, though, with his dedication and conduct not going unnoticed.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Cobham on Friday morning, Maresca commended Garnacho, hinting that he might make his debut against Brentford this weekend. The Chelsea boss said: \"He's working well. For sure he needs to work because he arrived here probably not 100 per cent fit. So he needs to work. He's working well and we'll see. But hopefully soon we can give him minutes.\"",
      "Garnacho gave an interview when he swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge at the end of last month, laying out why he made the move. Speaking to the official club website, he said: \"I have a winning mentality. I have passion and a big personality.",
      "\"It's a natural fit with a club like Chelsea, which have just won the Club World Cup. Chelsea are at the top now, and it's important to fight for the club like the fans deserve. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special â it means we're the best team in the world!\".",
      "\"It's not common to have played a lot of games at this age, but it has helped me a lot. I'm only 21 and I have a lot of experience from these different types of games, stadiums and moments.\"",
      "Garnacho had been a key player under Ruben Amorim until he was unexpectedly benched for the Europa League final. The winger had featured in every previous knockout match in the tournament, so the choice immediately raised questions about his future.",
      "Days later, the United manager left him out of the matchday squad entirely for the Premier League season finale. Garnacho was told he could depart - and promptly sealed a Â£40million switch to Chelsea.",

      "Shaun Wright-Phillips has revealed that Mario Balotelli once told Manchester police he'd \"robbed a bank\" after scoring twice to help City beat United 6-1 in the derby. The Italian striker spent two-and-a-half seasons with Manchester City and was notorious for his on and off-field antics, which frequently landed him in hot water.",
      "City fans will always fondly remember Balotelli's performance in one particular derby, where reigning Premier League champions Manchester United were humiliated 6-1 at Old Trafford. Balotelli scored twice and famously lifted his shirt to reveal an undershirt that read 'Why Always Me?', a nod to the constant scrutiny he faced while playing in England.",
      "Wright-Phillips, who had two spells with City spanning seven seasons, appeared on BBC Sport's YouTube channel to discuss the upcoming derby this weekend and reminisced about his time during these intense matches.",
      "Speaking about Balotelli, Wright-Phillips said: \"He was like a 12-year-old in almost like an adult's body. Like the things he would do, you'd expect from a 12 or 13-year-old, like the fireworks in his bathroom. Like, who would think of that when you've got a garden? Why would you light fireworks in your bathroom?\"",
      "The 43-year-old recounted a hilarious incident involving Balotelli after the notorious 6-1 match, where the Italian striker found himself in hot water with the police.",
      "\"He said to me one time when he came to training, he's like, 'Shaun, you'll never guess what happened to me yesterday,'\" Wright-Phillips said.",
      "\"So he said to me, 'After the game, I decided I'm just going to drive through Alderley Edge with my roof down and sing Manchester City songs because we beat United.' And then he said he got pulled over.",
      "\"He's obviously got cash on him because he's going somewhere. Police have asked him why he's got cash. He's turned around, he said to me, 'I told them I robbed the bank.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Why would you like think of that?' That's just his personality. Like he said, it's just his character. I bet some player he could've been, and some player he was at the time.\"",
      "Balotelli spent almost three seasons with City, scoring 30 goals and providing six assists in 80 appearances for the club. His time in Manchester was marred by injuries and suspensions, as the young forward also struggled to keep his on-pitch antics in check.",
      "Throughout his entire City career, the now-35 year old was yellow carded 21 times, two of which led to second offences and a sending off, and two straight red cards as well.",
      "Despite his notorious behaviour, Balotelli will forever be etched in memory for his legendary celebration during the once uncommon City victory in the Manchester derby. Regrettably for United, Pep Guardiola's squad now frequently secure the three points in this fierce game.",
      "But now, Ruben Amorim is planning to carry forward the momentum from United's 3-2 triumph over Burnley prior to this month's international break, as the two long-standing rivals prepare to clash once more at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",

      "Wayne Rooney opened up on the footballing advice he's handed his children as his eldest son, Kai, deals with injury. The 15-year-old, who is a Manchester United youth player, has followed in his father's footsteps by turning out for the Red Devils and recently earned promotion to the club's Under-19s squad, demonstrating the potential he possesses.",
      "However, the teenager's momentum - which saw him score a left-foot volley for the Under-18s - has been halted in cruel fashion after he took to Instagram to upload a mirror selfie that showed him on crutches whilst wearing a protective boot on his right foot.",
      "Kai, 15, captioned the photo writing: \"Life can't get worse,\" adding a crying emoji alongside the brief message, suggesting he's suffered an injury while playing for United's academy. While the nature of the injury or the length of his absence has yet to confirmed, it remains to be seen when the youngster can expect to return to action.",
      "It was in 2020 when he first joined the United youth set-up at 11 years old, and while he usually plays centrally, similar to Rooney Sr, he's shown versatility in his performances on the flanks.",
      "On top of the coaching he's received at United, he does possess a person at home with a wealth of knowledge of the game â his father. It was during Friday's edition of The Wayne Rooney Show that the 39-year-old delved into the guidance he'd give his sons when it comes to improving their footballing skills.",
      "\"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he said to Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Despite having handed words of wisdom to his children over the years when it comes to football matters, the former England captain admitted he's a proponent of allowing Kai to find his feet in the sport without constant advice from himself.",
      "Speaking with BBC Sport during the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it.",
      "\"Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\" After leaving Plymouth Argyle last year following just 25 games in charge, Rooney has yet to return to management.",

      "âSometimes you as a club you try to see different options. We have an option [in Lammens] who can give us different things in this moment, but who also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a number of years.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that new signing Senne Lammens WON'T start the Manchester derby, instead preferring Altay Bayindir. But three Manchester United stars will miss the game through injury.",
      "Lammens, 23, was signed from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day, with the Red Devils agreeing to pay an initial Â£18.2million plus Â£3.5m in add-ons for the Belgian goalkeeper. A debate quickly ensued regarding who'd get the nod in goal when United take on bitter rivals Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday.",
      "But Amorim has cleared up the speculation more than 48 hours before kick-off. \"It's the same thing I do with different positions, but Altay is going to continue,\" the Red Devils boss said at his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"I believe in Altay he is ready to play. It's a different league, a different country, a different ball. So they will fight for the position. We are really pleased [with Lammens]. He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "\"We are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience, but we also have to look at the present, with a focus on the future, so it's a bit of both. He will be ready.",
      "\"Sometimes you as a club you try to see different options. We have an option [in Lammens] who can give us different things in this moment, but who also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a number of years.\"",
      "Turkey international Bayindir started all three of United's Premier League games before the international break, regularly looking suspect. That was after the 27-year-old was promoted to first-choice goalkeeper by Amorim, dislodging Andre Onana, who's now joined Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "\"Andre had a very good season and the quality is there, but in the club sometimes things are getting harder and harder and at this club the pressure is so hard in every detail, so sometimes you need a change,\" the United manager explained.",
      "\"I think we - and Andre - understood that this needed a change and sometimes it's hard to point out why. Sometimes it's the moment, the bad luck in some moments, it's hard on him and on us.",
      "\"Our thinking was to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre, he was really good, working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.\"",
      "Lammens is expected to be on the bench come Sunday, unlike three of his new team-mates. Amorim confirmed that Diogo Dalot, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha will all be unavailable due to injury.",
      "Mount and Cunha were both taken off during United's last game before the international break, a dramatic 3-2 win against Burnley. Dalot, meanwhile, left the Portugal camp early after suffering an injury.",
      "\"I think they are out for this game,\" Amorim revealed. \"I don't know how long it is going to take. We need those players to be a very, very competitive team, but we have very good players that are eager to play so we will be competitive on Sunday, but they are out, they cannot help us in this game.",
      "\"I don't want to say [how long they will be out]. If you talk with Cunha, if you catch Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game! So I don't know. We will manage day by day, but they are pushing hard and that is a good thing.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United star Morgan Schneiderlin looks to have had a seamless transition in his post-football career. The Frenchman, 35, enjoyed a 19-year career that saw him represent the likes of Southampton, Everton and the Red Devils in the Premier League.",
      "After beginning his professional career with boyhood club Strasbourg, it was in 2008 that the midfielder swapped the side for the Saints and went on to stay on the south coast for the next seven years.",
      "His consistent performances in the English top-flight caught the eye of the Premier League's elite, which saw him sign for the Red Devils in a Â£24million transfer in 2015. With the career-defining move came a significant bump in pay as he was awarded a whopping Â£100,000-a-week contract.",
      "Despite the staggering numbers of his new deal, that didn't stop his wife, Camille Sold, from contributing financially in their relationship. Upon their arrival in Manchester, the couple resided at the five-star Lowry Hotel, with Camille spending her days manning the till and helping customers on the shop floor of the Adidas store in the city centre.",
      "The pair have been together for over a decade, with their romance first being sparked in early 2015. It was in 2016 when Schneiderlin proposed to the former shop assistant during a holiday to the French Riviera before later marrying her the following year.",
      "The Frenchman, who retired from football in 2024, left England in 2020 after a three-year stint at Goodison Park. He went on to play for the likes of Nice, Western Sydney Wanderers, Konyaspor and A.E. Kifisia.",
      "Since calling time on his career, Schneiderlin, as per his Instagram bio, is in the process of completing his UEFA A license, the highest practical coaching award available. He's also ventured into media as a pundit for Canal+ Sport.",
      "His sporting endeavours have not vanished completely as he's become a keen runner alongside his wife and recently completed his first marathon in April at the Paris Marathon. While Schneiderlin went on to experience life in three different countries after departing United, he later admitted that he ended his stay in Manchester prematurely.",
      "\"I learned a lot from my departure from Manchester United,\" the now 35-year-old told LâEquipe in 2022. \"I had played 40 matches the previous season with Manchester. When I come back from the Euros, I take 10 days off and I play very little for three, four months.",
      "\"Then, I have Ronald Koeman and Everton who are pushing hard to get me, every day, from October. I will remember it all my life: I should have played against Liverpool, starter, and the coach (Mourinho) comes to see me.",
      "\"He tells me he doesnât feel me inside the group. I tell him that indeed, with what has happened in the last three months, I am not in it and I want to go to Everton. I regretted it very quickly.",
      "\"Even if it went very well at Everton, when you play for Manchester United, when youâre at a club like that, itâs not for a moment of doubt that you have to question everything. Look at Ander Herrera: the first year I arrived, he was on the bench; he persevered, and today he is at PSG.\"",

      "Edinson Cavani provided Rafa Cotelo with vital funds when his daughter needed emergency surgery. The former Manchester United striker's friendship with the TV presenter is well documented in their native Uruguay, as is Cotelo's relationship with other stars like Luis Suarez.",
      "And Cavani's true colours shone through for all to see when he ensured that Cotelo's daughter, Emma, received the money for surgery required as a result of being born with hydrocephalus. Described by the NHS as \"a build-up of fluid in the brain,\" hydrocephalus can cause brain damage and even become fatal if left untreated.",
      "During a lengthy boat trip to Buenos Aires, Emma's condition began to worsen by the minute before she was taken to a clinic to be assessed by an assistant neurosurgeon. There, Cotelo was told that his daughter needed immediate surgery.",
      "As Emma was rushed into the operating theatre, Cotelo headed to pay for the operation, only to be hit with a major obstacle. The clinic performing the procedure demanded that the journalist pay in cash, despite him offering to make a bank transfer or to pay by card.",
      "Speaking about the heartbreaking encounter, he told Radio La Red: \"I had brought enough cash for a routine consultation, but as she required further treatment, the costs skyrocketed,\" adding that he was forced to turn to Cavani for help, given he was living in Argentina while playing for Boca Juniors.",
      "He added: \"Desperate, I called him, but he didn't answer. He was asleep. I had his wife's number, who is lovely, so I called her and woke her up. I explained the situation and apologised profusely.",
      "\"She put me through to Edi and he said, 'I happen to have that amount in cash, I'll be right over.' Five minutes later, he called me back, saying he'd set the GPS and was an hour away. 'I have a friend 10 minutes away, he'll take the money to you.'",
      "\"I got out with Emma's mum, freezing cold and scared, and in the dark a skinny guy appeared with a bag full of Argentinean money and said to me, 'Edi sent me, this is for you; if you need more, let me know.' It brought me back to life.",
      "\"He was like an angel to me, standing on the street, with a box full of money that Edi had sent me. I paid with that, it was enough, and the operation was carried out.\"",
      "Thankfully, Emma's operation ran smoothly, and today, Cotelo describes his daughter as: \"beautiful and happy, concerned only about her 15th birthday,\" largely thanks to Cavani's act of kindness. He also explained that after the story of the heroic feat went viral, he apologised to the player for making it public.",
      "He also ensured that his daughter handed the money back to Cavani personally, despite never asking for it to be returned. He added: \"He never mentioned it, but luckily I was able to give it back to him.",
      "\"It was my concern, and he said to me, 'What are you talking about? The important thing is that Emma is well.' The nicest thing was that Emma gave it back to him 15 days later, when we were discharged.\"",
      "In an interesting turn of events, Cavani's friend who gave Cotelo the money on the evening of the operation raised the funds from a tango bar he owns, with the presenter explaining how he emptied the till after a shift and took all the money he had to ensure that Emma could have her operation in an act of selflessness.",
      "After impressing with the likes of Danubio, Palermo, Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain, Cavani made the move to Manchester United in 2020 under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. There, he scored 19 goals in 59 games before transferring to Valencia.",
      "Following a season under the Spanish sun, Cavani signed for Boca Juniors in 2023, where he has remained since. At the age of 38, Cavani is still proving his worth in the Torneo Clausura, with a goal to his name from six outings for the Buenos Aires-based side.",

      "Premier League icon Brad Friedel has tipped Tiger Woods to be a roaring success if he were to invest in a club like Manchester United. However, he'd preferably like to see the golf great end up at another English giant instead.",
      "The modern age has given way to a number of high-profile athletes and celebrities getting involved in the ownership of British clubs. NFL legends Tom Brady and JJ Watt have succeeded since buying stakes in Birmingham City and Burnley, respectively, while Wrexham have soared up the ranks under the reign of Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "This transformation in the ownership landscape sparked comments from former Premier League star Matt Jansen, who tipped a figure like Woods to be a success if he made a similar investment. And former Liverpool goalkeeper Friedel, who is also a self-confessed fan of the club, agreed it would be a coup for any top club to attract such a name.",
      "\"I saw Matt Jansen say he'd like Tiger Woods to take over Man United,\" the American told Mr-gamble.com. \"I would prefer he does not go to Old Trafford. But it would be brilliant for the Premier League if he did. Go to Liverpool instead, Tiger!\"",
      "Despite the initial excitement surrounding Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority takeover of United, fortunes on the pitch are yet to have been transformed under the British billionaire's regime. In fact, the Red Devils have registered their two lowest Premier League finishes since he started running the club's affairs in early 2024.",
      "It was back in August of this year that three-time Blackburn Player of the Season Jansen, who was once targeted by United, spoke glowingly of the new investment model in British football. And he brought up names like Woods and NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan as two examples of generational stars who could make an impact with the elite.",
      "\"I think Tom Brady is a good one,\" he recently told BettingLounge.co.uk. \"Maybe Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, people whoâve been at the top of their sport, the No. 1 in their sport, will always be impressive and can relate a little bit more to football than the music industry.",
      "\"It could be any club, couldnât it? But the likes of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods would probably be looking at Liverpool, Chelsea or Man United, those kinds of clubs. Theyâre that big a star. So is Tom Brady, but Birmingham are really putting their money where their mouth is. I think they'll be a force this season.",
      "\"They could target clubs in the EFL. Look at what Wrexham started and they've been a success. It'll be other people putting it to the likes of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, rather than them approaching clubs.\"",
      "Jansen went on to note the discontent currently surrounding Ratcliffe's running of the Red Devils. And while Woods may not be a learned mind in the world of football, he believes the 15-time major champion's \"aura could bring success.\"",
      "Woods' move to Old Trafford could be a match made in heaven, though Jansen also teased the idea of him staging a takeover at Lancashire rivals Blackburn. As Jansen noted, Rovers are \"in a bit of a mess\" with incumbent owners Venky's and could welcome the financial influence of a sporting magnate.",

      "Roy Keane has slammed the Football Association of Ireland, claiming they \"couldn't organise a p*** up in a brewery\" following dismal World Cup qualifying performances. The Manchester United icon hinted at his interest in managing his country after discussions, but appears to have ruled out that prospect.",
      "Keane earned 67 caps for Ireland between 1991 and 2005, experiencing a stormy international career that included the infamous Saipan controversy. He subsequently worked alongside Martin O'Neill as assistant manager with the national team for five years until 2018.",
      "Discussions between the 54-year-old and the FAI emerged last year, with Keane acknowledging he harboured ambitions to return to international management. However, following two disappointing World Cup qualifying clashes, his stance appears to have shifted considerably.",
      "\"They're up against it,\" said Keane, speaking on the Stick to Football podcast this week. \"I don't think the players are playing enough at the higher level for the bigger clubs. It's been tough on the manager. Physically, they're not great. My goodness.\"",
      "Asked by former team-mate Gary Neville if he has spoken to the FAI about becoming manager, Keane replied: \"Yeah, I spoke to them, of course. But I think they spoke to everybody.",
      "\"The reason you might take the job is that you think you could help the team. They might lack quality. Try to get them organised with a bit of fight and a bit of spirit.",
      "\"[But] it's a farce. The amount of people who have come up in the last six months saying they were offered a job or they've spoken to them. That's the FAI for you, they couldn't organise a p*** up in a brewery,\" he added.",
      "\"You look at the manager, and you fear for him. He's up against it. To lose to Armenia and be well beaten is a sore one. They've had some tough results over the last few years.\"",
      "This signals a significant shift from Keane's attitude last year, when he made it quite clear that taking the Ireland job could be on his agenda. Such a stark change comes on the back of poor Irish results under boss Heimir HallgrÃ­msson.",
      "They suffered a 2-1 defeat to Armenia this week after previously managing just a 2-2 stalemate with Hungary. This leaves them at the bottom of UEFA World Cup qualification Group F and facing an uphill battle, with leaders Portugal still to come.",
      "\"I did enjoy the international set-up when I was working with Martin as a coach. I like the dynamics, the flow of international football,\" Keane revealed on the same podcast in 2024.",
      "\"It wasn't 24 hours a day, but you're still working at a good level, so if you're on about dream jobs, I suppose - it's a bit silly saying it, but maybe the Irish job.",
      "\"But obviously, I think that ship has sailed as well. The only thing I have inside me is - I know I'm going back a long time, and obviously I worked with Martin for a while with Ireland - I do think I could do a good job.",
      "\"Maybe it's a bit of ego, I don't know. Maybe that will never leave me. But also, if I didn't go back into management, I'm fine with that. I've a great life. I've never been so contented in my life, so be careful what you wish for.",
      "\"I still have a feeling I could do something. Maybe that will never leave me. That's not a bad thing. But also, I'm very comfortable with what I'm doing.\"",

      "The Cameroonian goalkeeper was made surplus to requirements by United boss Ruben Amorim, who dropped him at the start of the Premier League campaign in favour of Altay Bayindir. Following Bayindir's shoddy start to the season and Onana's error-filled appearance in their humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town, United signed another goalkeeper, Senne Lammens.",
      "Lammens' arrival, for an initial Â£18.2million plus Â£3.5m in potential add-ons, pushed Onana further down the pecking order and he was unlikely to even make the bench for league games under Amorim. In search of regular game-time ahead of the 2026 World Cup, Onana decided to leave Old Trafford and sign for Trabzonspor ahead of the Turkish transfer window closing on Friday.",
      "The 29-year-old landed at Trabzon Airport alongside his wife, Melanie, and was immediately mobbed by supporters, putting a smile back on his face after making another error during Cameroon's 1-0 loss against Cape Verde on Tuesday. \"I am very happy. I can say that I am very happy,\" Onana told local outlet 61 Saat.",
      "\"I am starting a new project, a new adventure for me, I am very happy to be here. This is a feeling that makes me so happy. I've never felt so much love from people around me.",
      "\"It's a wonderful feeling to be made to feel at home from the very first moment. I want to start working as soon as possible and reciprocate that love by making them happy on the field.\"",
      "The loan, which doesn't include an option to buy, will see Trabzonspor cover his Â£120,000-a-week wages in full. Onana could make his debut as soon as Sunday, as his new team travel to Istanbul to face Fenerbahce.",
      "\"I'm always ready. Every player wants to play and take part in these kinds of matches,\" the Cameroon international added. \"Of course, we'll be playing against an important and strong opponent. But we're also aware of our strength.\"",
      "Onana spent two seasons with the Red Devils after joining from Inter Milan in July 2023. United forked out Â£47.2m to sign the former Ajax star, who was fresh off helping Inter reach the Champions League final.",
      "His first season was littered with errors and he did little to boost his reputation in his second term. Onana will wear his favoured No.24 shirt at Trabzonspor, who are currently second in the league table, having collected 10 points from four games.",

On top of a dismal debut campaign in Manchester last season, where he led the club to a lowly 15th-placed league finish, Amorim entered this season knowing that he was under pressure to produce results.",
      "\"I think he's got to go, if it's my decision, I'm going after Zinedine Zidane,\" the former Queens Park Rangers man said. \"I'll try to convince him to come to Manchester United. [It] shouldn't need doing but at this moment in time, you do.",

I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",

      "Dyche has been without a job since January, when he was dismissed by Everton, while Zidane has been out of management since 2021 after leaving Real Madrid.

      "The Premier League is back this weekend after a two-week international break which has deprived some managers of star players.",
      "While international breaks give managers a chance to take stock, they can also bring dread in the form of injuries. They are unfortunately a part of the game, but when they occur on the watch of the national team, they can come with added tension.",
      "The Manchester Derby on Sunday is undoubtedly the headline attraction this weekend, but the return of Ange Postecoglou with Nottingham Forest, against Arsenal, is a close second.",
      "Mikel Arteta has some significant injury worries ahead of Saturdayâs early kick-off against Forest. Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus remain long-term absentees, while Bukayo Saka is also on the sidelines with a hamstring injury which Arteta admitted could be âsignificantâ.",
      "William Saliba withdrew from international duty with France after twisting his ankle at Anfield. French media had reported that he was facing a significant spell on the sidelines, but Arteta had some positive news in his pre-match press conference on friday afternoon: \"William trained today so we have a decision to make.\"",
      "Summer signings Cristhian Mosquera and Piero Hincapie are ready to deputise if needed. Ben White is expected to return for the Forest game, having not featured since the Manchester United game, while Christian Norgaard should also be available and could make his Arsenal debut.",
      "Matty Cash, Amadou Onana and Boubacar Kamara are all doubts for Villaâs match against Everton. Cash picked up âa severe bruiseâ to his quadriceps while on international duty with Poland, while Onana and Kamara both have hamstring issues. Unai Emery will have to balance the risk with the trio, while Ross Barkley is still likely to be considered short of match fitness.",
      "Cherries captain Adam Smith suffered a hamstring injury before the international break. Lewis Cook is a doubt with a knee injury and Enes Unal remains out with a serious knee injury sustained last season.",
      "Vitaly Janelt could rejoin the fold after working on his fitness following injury. Paris Maghoma is in a similar boat, having missed pre-season due to injury, while Gustavo Nunes is still battling to get fit. Yunus Konak could return after an ankle injury.",
      "Mats Wieffer could be involved for the Seagulls as they play Bournemouth, but Adam Webster and Solly March are still long-term absentees.",
      "Connor Roberts could make his return from a knee injury, but Jordan Beyer, Zeki Amdouni and Manuel Benson are still unavailable for Scott Parkerâs side.",
      "Uncertainty surrounds the status of Cole Palmer after he pulled up in the warm-up ahead of Chelsea âs 5-1 win at West Ham with a groin issue. But Levi Colwill (ACL) and Liam Delap (hamstring) are definitely out for the foreseeable future.",
      "Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia are unlikely to return just yet. âI don't think they will be back after the international break, but they will be closer,â Enzo Maresca said last month. Dario Essugo has undergone surgery on a thigh issue picked up on international duty with Portugal under-21s.",
      "Maresca may leave Reece James on the bench after he started both England games during the international break; the defenderâs workload continues to be managed at Chelsea.",
      "Oliver Glasner managed to keep hold of Marc Guehi on deadline day, but he does have injuries to worry about. Ismaila Sarr is unavailable with a hamstring injury and Adam Wharton is also a major doubt with a muscle injury.",
      "Eddie Nketiah, Cheick Doucoure and Chadi Riad are all still out, managing longer-term issues, but Matheus Franca is on the comeback from injury.",
      "David Moyes started the season with a decimated defence and Jarrad Branthwaite and Vitaliy Mykolenko were still absent from training earlier this week. Nathan Patterson is also a doubt, but we should know more after Moyesâ pre-match press conference.",
      "Marco Silva could have a clean bill of health for the home match against Leeds on Saturday. Issa Diop missed the 2-0 defeat by Chelsea before the break, but should be fit enough to return to the squad.",
      "Goalkeeper Lucas Perri has already been ruled out for two games with a thigh injury, meaning Karl Darlow will start in goal at Craven Cottage. Daniel Farke has already spoken to the media and confirmed positive news on Ethan Ampadu and Ao Tanaka.",
      "âSome good news with Ethan and Ao Tanaka,â he said. âSince the beginning of this week, both have integrated in major parts of team training. We have 48 hours more, and we will take a late decision with them. It is possible we travel with both; it is also possible that neither will travel.â But there are doubts over forwards Lukas Nmecha, who missed training this week, and Joel Piroe, who has a bruised calf.",
      "Alexander Isak could make his debut this weekend after a Â£125million move from Newcastle, but his minutes will be managed after a limited pre-season. Arne Slot was full of praise for the way Sweden handled him during the international break after he sat out of the 2-2 draw with Slovenia and played a limited role against Kosovo.",
      "âWe will treat Alex the same, so don't expect 90 mins every week, he missed pre-season and team sessions so we have to build him up gradually,â Slot said. Expect Isak to start on the bench.",
      "Ibrahima Konate went off with cramp in the 1-0 win over Arsenal on August 31, but featured for France earlier this week so will be fine. Jeremie Frimpong could make a return this weekend, having returned to training after picking up a thigh injury last month.",
      "Pep Guardiola has the highest number of injuries of any Premier League boss right now after Omar Marmoush picked up a knee injury while playing for Egypt and will be out for a few weeks. Rayan Cherki, Mateo Kovacic and Kalvin Phillips are long-term absentees, Rayan Ait-Nouri is unavailable and John Stones another doubt after being forced to pull out of the England squad with a muscle injury. \"Not a big issue but heâs a doubt for Sunday,\" Guardiola said of Stones.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov was pulled out of the Brighton game with a knock, but is fine and is expected to return against United while Josko Gvardiol is yet to feature this season. Phil Foden and Savinho could also return this weekend for the derby.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount picked up injuries in the win over Burnley before the international break. Cunha has been busy posting positive updates on social media, so could return, while Diogo Dalot pulled out of international duty with a muscle injury. Lisandro Martinez is a long-term absentee with a knee injury.",
      "The big news for the Magpies is that Â£55m new striker Yoane Wissa is injured, having picked up a problem while playing for DR Congo. \"He won't make this game,\" Eddie Howe said. \"He is feeling the effects of the injury just before he came off. He will go away for tests and maybe see a specialist to see.\"",
      "Fellow new arrival Jacob Ramsey is also out with an ankle injury picked up in the 0-0 draw with Leeds before the break and Anthony Gordon is suspended after getting sent off for chopping down Virgil van Dijk. Howe hopes to have Joelinton back available after he missed the last game.",
      "Ola Aina picked up an injury on international duty with Nigeria so is a major doubt. Oleksandr Zinchenko canât face his parent club Arsenal. Nicolas Dominguez is still sidelined.",
      "The Black Cats will be without Romaine Mundle, Denis Cirkin, Leo Hjelde, Dan Ballard, Luke OâNien and Aji Alese, who are all out injured, but Niall Huggins could return this weekend.",
      "James Maddison, Radu Dragusin and Dejan Kulusevski are long-term absentees, but Yves Bissouma and Dominic Solanke could return this weekend. Solanke has been managing an ankle issue, while Thomas Frank didnât sound concerned about the issue that had kept Bissouma out last month.",
      "The only issue for Graham Potter appears to be Niclas Fullkrug, who returned from international duty with a minor injury that needs assessing. âWe've got Niclas, who has had a slight issue with his calf from international duty, so he came [back] early. He's trained lightly today, so we'll see how he reacts,â he said.",
      "Itâs all eyes on Jorgen Strand Larsen this weekend after the forward pulled out of international duty with Norway with an Achilles issue. He missed the 3-2 defeat by Everton on August 30 and will be a big miss if heâs unavailable to face Newcastle too. Ki-Jana Hoever and Hugo Bueno will face fitness tests before the match this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ferdinand had worked for the broadcaster for a decade since his retirement from the top-flight in 2015, offering up his commentary and bold opinions on various major matches across the Premier League and Champions League. The 46-year-old has often been one to divide opinion, consistently voicing his thoughts on his former club United and their struggles over recent years.",
      "While many may have expected the ex-defender to take the leap into management, similar to his former team-mates Gary Neville and Roy Keane, that plan is off the table for Ferdinand. Speaking to the Mail, he said: \"I wouldnât have moved away if I wanted to go into management.",
      "He still keeps up with various other media responsibilities, including his YouTube channel that focuses mainly on the latest at Old Trafford and also in the Premier League. Discussing how his son keeps up with the top flight while thousands of miles away, Ferdinand added: \"We are watching games. Obviously, he has to stay up a little bit later than normal but itâs still been good.\"",
      "He still hopes to make it to more games in person, but admits he is looking forward to just taking in the sport and not watching for his work's sake. Ferdinand said: \"Working at TNT and being heavily involved in travelling to games, Iâm not doing that as much now.",
      "\"But as the season goes by Iâll get to more and more games. Thatâs inevitable because when you love football the way I do, you just want to watch some football. Iâll be taking in some games locally as well, Iâm sure.",
      "\"Iâm still working and doing bits and pieces, but being around the family and being more present was one of the reasons for coming here and itâs really paying off, so thatâs nice.\"",
      "Despite taking a step back from punditry, Ferdinand is still making his feelings known on United ahead of the all-important Manchester derby this weekend. Ruben Amorim's side will take on Pep Guardiola's City on Sunday at 4:30pm, and the ex-Red Devils star was on hand to deliver his thoughts on the upcoming game.",
      "Reflecting on which current United players are good enough to start in a combined Manchester XI, Ferdinand said: \"Bruno [Fernandes]. I put Leny Yoro in there. I think he is going to be a standout this year. [Bryan] Mbeumo probably gets in there now. [Matheus] Cunha might have a chance.",
      "\"At the moment City have got a better squad than us, I think thatâs a fact. I donât think many people would argue with that. Thatâs just the way it is at the moment. But Man United have had a good transfer window, ins and outs, and hopefully weâll see the benefits of that by the end of the season.",
      "\"We needed more pace and players who can execute a transition both ways; more durability, more ability to keep pace with teams. They have addressed that, definitely in the forward areas. I still think more of a dynamic midfielder could have been brought in. I think they attempted but it didnât materialise. I think theyâre going the right way in that.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney once admitted it's too early to bank on his aspiring footballer son, Kai, turning professional for Manchester United. That was before Kai, 15, issued a heartbreaking update after sustaining an injury, where he said, \"life can't get worse\".",
      "Rooney junior has had big boots to fill since joining United's academy set-up as an 11-year-old in 2020, given that his dad is one of the greatest English footballers ever and the club's all-time leading goal scorer.",
      "Yet, the youngster reportedly scored 56 goals in his debut season with the Red Devils. He's followed in his dad's footsteps by usually operating in a central position but also impacting games in wider areas, earning him comparisons with the United legend.",
      "Kai's ascent through the youth ranks saw him recently called up to the United-19s squad, where he played with other prospects who are four years older than him. His call-up was followed by a sweet goal he scored for the Under-18s, which saw him fire a left-footed volley into the top corner.",
      "But the teenager's momentum has now come to a crashing halt. This week, Kai took to Instagram to upload a mirror selfie showing him on crutches while wearing a protective boot on his right foot.",
      "In a caption overlaying the photo, he wrote: \"Life can't get worse,\" alongside a crying emoji, suggesting he has picked up a major injury while playing in United's development team.",
      "The tone of his post suggests it may be a long time until he is back playing for United again. While he is yet to wrestle the spotlight onto himself in the same way as his iconic father did when he burst onto the scene at Everton aged 16, Kai's ability and playing style is certainly reminiscent of his famous father in his pomp at Old Trafford.",
      "But Rooney has been quick to remove any pressure from his son by taking things one step at a time, consistently stating it's too early to tell whether Kai will make it and warning his son there is a long road ahead.",
      "Even before the injury, the 39-year-old sought to keep Kai level-headed and not get his hopes up. Speaking with Gary Neville, he said: \"[He has] my physique, but he'll be taller than me and he's a goal scorer, he's in the box, he sniffs chances out and that's his game, so he's doing okay.\"",
      "Fellow United legend Neville then asked: \"Obviously you can't remember yourself, but is he at that sort of level where you think he's got a chance, or is it too early?\"",
      "Rooney replied: \"I think it's too early, you never know. I think he's showing potential and good signs. So, obviously, he'll be at United now for the next two years, and that's when they make decisions on you, so just wait and see.\"",

      "Manchester United are in talks to play a series of lucrative midweek friendlies in order to fill the gaping void left by their lack of European football. The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League last term and lost the Europa League final, resulting in them failing to qualify for Europe for the first time since the 2013-14 season.",
      "United were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup last month in humiliating fashion, meaning that they're on track to play their fewest amount of matches in a season since the First World War - unless they reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim believes that there's a major silver lining, as he'll have work time on the training ground to work with his players. Amorim has also suggested that his team aren't yet ready to be competitive both domestically and in Europe.",
      "But the bigwigs at Old Trafford have other plans, having missed out on a Â£100million payday after their failure to qualify for the Champions League. The Sun report that United are considering playing midweek matches against a host of other clubs on the continent who aren't involved European competition.",
      "It's said that the likes of AC Milan, Lazio, RB Leipzig and Sevilla - who all find themselves in the same predicament as Amorim's side - are among their potential opponents.",
      "In addition, the matches could be played in front of paying crowds, for example in the UAE. United, who have 11 free midweeks between now and Christmas, earned an estimated Â£7.8million during their post-season tour of Asia, boosting their financial resources ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim is planning to take his squad on a number of team bonding trips during the season. The Portuguese reportedly reckons that visits to the Algarve and the Middle East would allow his players to spend more time in each other's company and strengthen their connection both on and off the pitch.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Ahead of the 2025-26 campaign, in which they've only won one of their four matches so far, defender Harry Maguire said that United's quieter schedule gives them 'no excuses' and an advantage over their rivals. \"We're going to have a lot of time to prepare for the Premier League games, and we've got to make sure we're ready,\" Maguire told MUTV.",
      "The Red Devils are back in Premier League action on Sunday. Maguire and Co. face bitter rivals City in this season's first Manchester derby.",

      "After welcoming their players back from international duty, United face Manchester City on Sunday afternoon. The game will have a fresh feeling for both sides, who could start new goalkeepers in the form of Senne Lammens and Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "United signed Lammens on transfer deadline day and are sending Andre Onana out on loan to Trabzonspor as Ruben Amorim tinkers with his goalkeepers. He has decisions to make all across the pitch, with the new-look attack of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha yet to click into gear, and midfield issues persisting.",
      "\"I just hope they're not making the same mistake with this player, because he's only young, had no experience in the Premier League, and I think that's where I would have liked maybe Ollie Watkins or someone coming in to Man United, who's been there, seen it, knows the league, can help a young player.",
      "\"So I hope they don't expect him to come straight into the football club and go and hit the ground running and scoring goals. Certainly, obviously, everyone wants him to do that, but it's a really tough ask to go into that football club and have a young player who has no experience to go in.\"",
      "Andre Onana flew from Paris to Trabzon in Turkey yesterday to complete his season-long loan deal with Trabzsonspor. The Cameroon international joined United two seasons ago and has been the No.1 goalkeeper ever since, but has been ousted this summer.",
      "After Altay Bayindir started the opening three Premier League games, United paid Â£18.2m to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. The 23-year-old Belgian could make his debut in the derby on Sunday, while Onana has departed to play football elsewhere.",
      "It is some turnaround for Onana, who arrived for Â£47m from Inter Milan, having helped them reach the Champions League final, but has seen his reputation destroyed at Old Trafford.",
      "It's fair to say that Manuel Ugarte has not proven to be the transformational signing United fans hoped. The ex-Paris Saint-Germain midfielder joined the club a year ago in a deal potentially worth Â£50.5million, but he's yet to make his mark in a position the club desperately need filling.",
      "Casemiro is still preferred in holding midfield, while Kobbie Mainoo and Ugarte have to be happy with a place on the bench under Amorim's management. Ugarte is an experienced Uruguay international, but former Scotland player Craig Burley is bemused by him.",
      "Laying into the player on ESPN, he said: \"Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He's just like a wet blanket. Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, 'Who the hell is this guy?' Seriously.\"",

      "Andre Onana will double his money at Trabzonspor after finally sealing a loan escape route from his Manchester United misery.",
      "Cameroon goalkeeper Onana flew into Turkey with his wife Melanie on Thursday afternoon to seal a switch to the Turkish Super Lig club having only appeared once for United this season, in the shock Carabao Cup loss to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought in Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day, and that move coupled with Onana's shaky form since his Â£47.2million move from Inter Milan two years ago effectively sealed the 29-year-old's exit.",
      "However, the Mail report that there is no option for Trabzonspor to buy Onana next summer included in the loan deal, and nor have the Turkish club paid United a loan fee to recruit him for the campaign.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, the report adds that Onana will double his weekly wages with Trabzonspor covering them in their entirety for the year. Onana recently saw his wages drop from around Â£170,000 a week to Â£120,000 a week - Â£67,000 a week after tax - due to United failing to qualify for the Champions League, and Turkey has a more favourable tax rate.",
      "United wished Onana well in a statement, saying: \"In his first season at United, Andre was part of the squad that lifted the Emirates FA Cup following a 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium.",
      "\"Onana played 50 times in his second campaign and our no.24 has now agreed a loan move to Trabzonspor. The move has been completed ahead of the Turkish transfer window closing on Friday. We would like to wish Andre good luck.\"",
      "But after a string of high-profile errors during his time at the club, plenty of United fans welcomed the move on social media.",

      "Another added: \"Please just let him leave for free in case they bring him back, we won't mind,\" while a third said simply: \"End of an error.\"",
      "Onana did receive some support online after the move though, with one fan writing: \"The problem isnât you, the problem is the Manchester United dump. Everyone who escapes from that dump ends up hitting their prime anyway, Onana.\"",

      "\"Sometimes you as a club, you try to see different options, sometimes you are able to do one option or another, we have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has the potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years. That was our choice in the end.",
      "\"Altay is going to continue (in goal) because itâs a different league, a different country, different trainings, different ball, so we will try to maintain that. They will fight for the position. For this game, it is clear Altay will start.\"",
      "Amorim declined to offer a return date for Mount, Cunha and Dalot. \"They are out for this game, I donât know how long itâs going to take, we need the guys to be a very, very competitive team. We have players who are eager, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out, they cannot help us in this game.",
      "\"I donât want to say. If you talk with Cunha, if you catch Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game! I don't know. We will manage day by day but they are pushing really hard. And that is a good thing.\"",
      "Amorim felt it was in the best interests of all parties that Onana left on loan. âNot just us as a club but also Andre, I think we understood this needed a change. Sometimes itâs hard to point why. Itâs the performance, itâs the moment, the bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us.",
      "âOur thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana. He was really good on working, trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need to change the environment to return to your level. That was a feeling for us and for Andre.â",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised to prolong Manchester United's record of including an academy player in every first team matchday squad dating back to October 1937.",
      "United only have four academy members in their current first team squad following the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea. Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson is likely to struggle for playing time after his first-half performance in the League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town, Kobbie Mainoo has started in 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge and 17-year-old striker Chido Obi is yet to be included in a matchday squad this term.",
      "Mainoo, 20, wanted to leave on loan last month but was blocked by the club amid a shortage of specialist midfielders. The Mancunian scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City and could start in Sunday's derby at the Etihad in the absence of injured duo Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The derby will mark the 4,326th consecutive United match with an academy player in their squad. \"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "United were unbeaten against City across three derbies last season and won at the Etihad in Amorim's seventh match in charge through two late goals.",
      "City suffered their first trophyless season since Pep Guardiola's first at the club in 2016-17 and dropped to third in the table, having won four successive Premier League titles. They have spent more than Â£300m on signings this calendar year but have lost two of their first three league games and head into the derby below United.",
      "\"It's a top team with the best coach in the league,\" Amorim added. \"A team that is really hard to imagine how they are going to play.",
      "\"They change all the time. But we are prepared for that.",
      "\"And we believe in our team. And I have that feeling. So it will be a very good game. We know what to do, we have one more training. The table, in the moment, it doesn't matter. I'm just worried about maintaining the same principles. The way we fight for every ball. The small details that sometimes we drop a little bit. Not in these games.",
      "\"So I'm more comfortable in these kinds of games. But we will be ready against a very, very good team.\"",
      "Amorim is convinced United have improved since they defeated City nine months ago. \"I think we are a better team. Any aspect, if you see the data, we are a different team. We are ready to play the game. But we have to show onside. So I think we are a better team.\"",
      "Amorim's close friend, Hugo Viana, is now the City sporting director. Viana and Amorim worked together at Sporting and the prospect of a reunion at the Etihad was floated before United hired Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag in October.",
      "Viana and Amorim still socialise but their friendship will have no bearing on the weekend's game. \"No, it has no influence. We have different jobs, we have different clubs. We have dinner all the time and don't talk about football.",
      "\"I'm red, he's blue. But we are really, really close friends. That will not change. So I hope to win Sunday and that's it.\"",

      "Whilst strolling through the quaint streets of Lyon hours before Manchester Unitedâs Europa League quarter-final, a WhatsApp voice note arrived from a contact. It contained an instruction.",
      "In the event that United won, this correspondent was advised to get Andre Onanaâs attention in the mixed zone by addressing him with a specific phrase in Italian. Onana would then stop to chat and do something âfunnyâ to defuse the fallout from his pre-match comments that United were âway betterâ than Lyon. Onanaâs own brand of comedy was reserved for his performance that evening.",
      "There were two more errors, the second an added-time fumble that invited Rayan Cherki to equalise. Before kick-off at the Groupama Stadium, Onana, iPhone headphones on, casually strolled over to one of the goal frames to check that they were stable. They were. He wasnât.",
      "Officials at United were unhappy about the âway betterâ quip that Onana uttered to four of us in the makeshift mixed zone at Old Trafford, the only memorable event from a dour derby. Onanaâs delivery was not disparaging yet it elicited a withering response from Nemanja Matic at the pre-match press conference.",
      "âIf you are one of the worst 'keepers in Manchester United history, you need to take care,\" Matic warned. \"If David de Gea, Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar said that, I would question myself.",
      "\"But if, statistically, you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's modern history, he needs to show that before he says.\"",
      "Onana never truly recovered from that week. The public ridicule preceded his withdrawal from the weekend shellacking by Newcastle United. Ruben Amorim took him out of the firing line and has now effectively fired him. His exit route to Turkey signals career decline at 29, a premature age for a goalkeeper.",
      "A montage of Onanaâs âmistakesâ has gained 2.2 million views online. Some additions are unfair and some glaring errors are also conspicuous by their absence. In 102 appearances, Onana comfortably conceded at least two dozen saveable or avoidable goals, depending on the slack you cut a âkeeper.",
      "A quirk of his second sorry season is that it was going well until Amorim arrived. No memorable cock-ups, important saves in key games at Southampton and Porto and a save of the season contender at Crystal Palace. The regression was instigated by Arsenal and their set pieces three days before Morgan Gibbs-Whiteâs pot-shot unfathomably flummoxed Onana.",
      "Senior figures at United were downplaying a goalkeeping addition in the final weeks of last season. The priority was the attack and people at the club liked Onanaâs character. Us journalists can attest to this.",
      "On a chilly evening at the City Ground, Onana was warm company as he admitted how trying his first six months in Manchester had been off the pitch. He is a bullish and candid conversationalist befitting a United goalie. He could talk the talk but not walk the walk.",
      "Onana was under the impression he was safe on account of his warm rapport with Amorim. Perhaps Amorim lulled him into a false sense of security. Onana had a tight bond with Erik ten Hag and was never going to be as close with Amorim, who has leant heavily on fellow Portuguese speakers Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Casemiro and now Matheus Cunha. Ultimately, their working relationship was moot as Onana continued to err.",
      "Historically, United have had to bide their time when it comes to replacing an incumbent number one. De Gea was released after weeks of indecision. Tim Howard, Fabien Barthez and Mark Bosnich had ceased to be the first choice by the time they were jettisoned. Alex Stepney had a second lease of life after Wilf McGuinness was sacked with the reappointment of Sir Matt Busby. Onana is not halfway through a five-year contract and his escape routes were reduced to Turkey or Saudi Arabia.",
      "He has not even moved to one of Turkey's eminent clubs. Jose Mourinho, an admirer of Onanaâs, had no intention of moving for Onana before he was dismissed by Fenerbahce, who opted for the other phased-out goalie from Manchester in Ederson. Galatasaray were also keen on the Brazilian.",
      "Not for the first time, United have botched a succession plan in goal. Onana represented a more modern goalie than De Gea yet his once-famed distribution deserted him last season.",
      "United have settled for, or rather saddled with, Altay Bayindir. The consensus at United is the club is \"too demanding\" for a goalie who warmed the bench for Turkey during their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "Come Onana's last final appearance at Blundell Park, he was booed. United matchgoers became regularly irked by his delayed restarts at goal kicks last season, their mood not helped by Onana occasionally urging them to relax.",
      "This jarred with his pre-season promise: \"I will take a lot of risks. I can tell you in advance already!\" he chuckled to a few of us pitchside at UCLA. \"Be prepared because itâs gonna be this season, trust me! I will enjoy it even more when this season starts.\"",
      "A few weeks after the aborted âfunnyâ in Lyon, United were revelling in one of their most accomplished European away victories of the last decade in Bilbao. Onana strolled past me in the San Mames mixed zone and offered a knowing wink.",
      "He sometimes kept goal as if one eye was permanently closed.",

      "Kayserispor have been identified as a good fit for Mather as he looks to take the next steps in his career.",
      "Although Mather's contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027, there is hunger on the player's behalf for regular starts after outgrowing academy football with the Under-21s.",
      "Mather has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role and the player is understood to be keen to play regular competitive football.",
      "United agreed an eleventh-hour loan move for Mather to join Tranmere Rovers in the January transfer window, but Nigel Adkins was sacked just a few weeks after the youngster's arrival.",

      "Despite the transfer window closing over a week ago, Manchester United are still being linked with players from across Europe. With Ruben Amorim unable to bring in more players, the focus has now shifted to offloading some of the squad.",
      "The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open, so there may see some departures from Old Trafford. Although the summer transfer window has closed in England, several United players could be on their way out as the trading periods in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are still active.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is one player who has left after securing a season-long loan move to Trabzonspor on Thursday. Tyrell Malacia's loan move to Elche fell through, but a temporary switch to Eyupspor is reportedly on the cards.",
      "However, there were reports on Wednesday evening suggesting that the defender was not keen on the move. Meanwhile, potential future signings are also being considered, with a long-term plan in place for Brighton's Carlos Baleba after United were unable to finalise a deal this summer.",
      "Follow all the United transfer news updates throughout the day below...",
      "Manchester United have submitted their Premier League squad for the first half of the 2025/26 season.",
      "Premier League clubs submit up to 25 players to form their squads. The list can be tweaked in the January transfer window, but each side have now submitted their squad before this weekend's round of fixtures.",
      "United have just 21 players in their squad, but the number is bolstered by players named in the Under-21 section, which include Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo, Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven.",
      "Premier League rules state U21 players do not need to be named in the main squad, which can include no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the homegrown player criteria.",
      "A homegrown player is deemed somebody who, irrespective of nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the FA or the FAW for a period of three entire seasons, or 36 months, before his 21st birthday, or the end of the season during which he turns 21.",
      "United's homegrown players are Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee, Rhys Bennett, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Amad.",

Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he boldly said the latter, who joined the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "So far, the 22-year-old has only started one game under Ruben Amorim, which was the disastrous League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, after seeing both Haaland and Sesko when they were both raw football talents, Aufhaser is confident the United forward will fulfil his potential.",

Having held that position for four years, the ex-Scotland international became technical assistant for nearly half a year before eventually taking on the role of technical director.",

To some extent, it did, with Ruben Amorim's side deserved winners overall, even if they needed a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes to earn all three points.",

      "A new midfielder was wanted by Ruben Amorim in the summer but United failed with their move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba. Interest in Wharton followed soon after that with the 21-year-old perhaps not receiving the plaudits his performances deserve.",
      "The lack of external hype in his game is reflected in his CIES Observatory ranking, which states a \"fair market\" value for his services is between Â£39m and Â£46m.",
      "It's far away from Palace's reported Â£100m price tag - a figure slated as \"mad\" and \"daft\" by Jamie Carragher - but's it's a significant rise from his January value of Â£28m, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Manchester United were focused on a goalkeeper signing in the final hours of the summer transfer window but attempts were made to bring in an attacker, according to reports.",

      "Remember, Mike Maignan is a free transfer next summer, so there will be experienced goalkeepers available.",

      "Sunday's Manchester derby will mark the 4,326th United first team match with a homegrown player in their squad. Before Ruben Amorim sat down at Carrington on Friday, it was forgivable to think the sequence was under more threat than his position.",
      "\"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "In the 25-man senior squad Amorim has assembled, there are now only four academy members. The 39-year-old Tom Heaton has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson may not play for United again after his first half horror show at Grimsby Town, Chido Obi has not had a kick this season and Kobbie Mainoo last started a Premier League match in May.",
      "Mainoo missed four months of last season through injury. In the hypothetical scenario that every United player bar Mainoo is available for a match, Amorim could feasibly pick a 20-man squad of Bayindir, Lammens, Dalot, Mazraoui, Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez, Heaven, Shaw, Dorgu, Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount, Amad, Cunha, Mbeumo, Zirkzee and Sesko.",
      "Heaven and Diego Leon, though teenagers, do not qualify as academy members. It was a grey area when Louis van Gaal's debutants were totted up. Reece James and Regan Poole did not qualify as they never played in the youth team.",
      "Amorim has put two 'keepers on the bench before, as Erik ten Hag occasionally used to. It would be a cop-out if the only academy representative in a United matchday squad is Heaton, who turns 40 in April.",
      "United have won only three of the past 11 Manchester derbies and two were decided by academy products. With Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount injured for Sunday's derby, Mainoo is in line for a recall.",
      "Since the Busby Babes, there has always been an academy poster boy through the decades. United's top five appearance makers - Ryan Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville - are graduates. George Best is 15th in the list. Sammy McIlroy and Arthur Albiston are in the top 25.",
      "Every United manager post-Ferguson has had an academy legacy: David Moyes's was Adnan Januzaj, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard came under Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho saw something in Scott McTominay, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer championed Mason Greenwood, Ralf Rangnick brought Anthony Elanga in from the cold while Erik ten Hag had Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Concern was briefly voiced that United's academy run, which dates back to October 1937, could be jeopardised by Van Gaal amid the Van Gaalactico summer of 2014 when Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were headline signings. Van Gaal ended up doling out 12 debutants to academy members, ranging from Saidy Janko to Rashford.",
      "Solskjaer trumped Van Gaal, affording names as obscure as D'Mani Mellor and Will Fish a chance. There were six academy debutants against Kazakhstani side Astana alone. After Solskjaer left, United sources were dismissive of his penchant for granting debuts to talents with little or no chance of breaking into the first team squad.",
      "Mourinho and Ten Hag were more selective, though the latter unfathomably promoted Omari Forson to the starting XI for the home defeat to Fulham in February 2024. Rangnick was also particular and championed Elanga, Garnacho, Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Carreras.",
      "It was sobering to hear Dan Ashworth opine that the era of the one-club player was effectively over a year ago. Ashworth, two months into his brief tenure as United's sporting director, was philosophically addressing the departure of McTominay, a sale that has become more contentious since he won the Scudetto with Napoli, was named Serie A's MVP and nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "The former United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was dismayed that the club had only two Ballon d'Or nominees in 2013 (Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney). They did have two Golden Boy nominees last year: Mainoo and Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho is gone and Mainoo was intent on going before United blocked him last month. He has started in a derisory 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge but a recall is in the offing against City.",
      "Three of the debutants under Amorim have come from the academy: Obi, Fredricson and Harry Amass. Amass did not train with the first team at all in pre-season and eventually joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan last Monday.",
      "With Noussair Mazraoui fit again, Fredricson is back in the stands. Obi, not 18 until late November, is having to bide his time in the under 21s, for whom he has scored two goals in two starts.",
      "Obi removed United from his Instagram bio last month. He has since restored it and he is not the first teenage footballer to act in a puerile manner. United have two strikers they invested more than Â£100million ahead of him and Obi has not set the world alight in his eight senior appearances. He has to bide his time.",
      "\"We all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games,\" the under 21 coach Travis Binnion told the MEN. \"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "United are undergoing a change of identity. Vital academy products have become sellable assets (McTominay's last start was in the 2024 FA Cup final) as they strive to comply with the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. A club famed for their wing play does not use conventional wingers as they dance to the tune of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and there will be a new Old Trafford in the 2030s.",
      "Eleven academy talents were included in Amorim's maiden pre-season squad but he is not one for gimmes. Dermot Mee, Will Murdock, Jack Fletcher and Reece Munro did not get a kick in the United States. Murdock enjoyed his work experience as Andre Onana was unfit.",
      "Bendito Mantato returned to the glamour of a mid-August friendly at Tamworth. Ethan Williams, a scorer in Chicago, came back down to earth on these shores with a Monday night at Middlesbrough.",
      "In a season where United could have as few as 40 fixtures, that first team ceiling could be impregnable for academy members. At least one will always be on the teamsheet, though.",

      "\"Fergie, sign him up,\" chanted Manchester United fans as Carlos Tevez sauntered back to the halfway line.",
      "Tevez scored the second goal in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City in May 2009, a win that meant United moved a step closer to successfully defending their Premier League crown.",
      "But Tevez's future had dominated headlines in the build-up to the Manchester derby. âI didnât read any of the papers. Heâs a Manchester United player,â insisted Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Tevez's future at Old Trafford had been dramatically thrown into doubt after he gave an exclusive interview to the News of the World. \"I am very sad about this, but I guess what Iâm saying is goodbye. I donât think Iâll be a United player next season,\" he said.",
      "\"They have never made me an offer or given me a contract. I have not been treated as a member of the family. The fans treat me like family, but United have not signed me, so they donât respect me.\"",
      "Tevez was coming to the end of his two-year United loan, but the deal was expected to be made permanent, with chief executive David Gill stating the situation would be resolved in 'early June'.",
      "Although United had communicated their intention to sign Tevez permanently throughout the season, the framework for a deal hadn't been finalised and the player felt he'd been disrespected, which led to a dramatic departure.",
      "United submitted their proposal, but it was too late. Tevez's representatives informed the club he would be leaving, and reports then emerged linking him with Liverpool and 'noisy neighbours' City entered discussions.",
      "âHe [Tevez] was a thorn in our side. I thought he played exceptionally well,\" said Mark Hughes after City's defeat in the derby. \"Iâve read the reports, but I donât want to comment.\"",
      "Tevez completed his move to City for Â£25.5million in mid-July and said: \"City showed me their ambition to be one of the biggest clubs in the world and I was happy to join.",
      "\"Money was not the most important thing about my move. I have a coach who wants me and a good fanbase and environment around me. I'm excited about working with Mark Hughes and building a good relationship with him. The objective is to win the league and I'm here to win things.\"",
      "Speaking about the controversial transfer years later, Rio Ferdinand told William Hill: \"The big one was when Tevez went there from us. That moment I was like 'rah' because I knew how good he was.",
      "\"We knew exactly what player they were getting. We were like 'nah', at the time I was like 'this guy doesn't understand the rivalry, what is he doing?' But at the same time, I knew the story behind it.",
      "\"He wanted to sign the contract at Man United well before that time. United delayed and didn't come to him, and the kind of guy he is, I have respect for him in the end for it, because he said you know what, you have disrespected me.",
      "\"He thought, 'I don't care what you offer me I am not signing'. I remember David Gill, the chairman at the time, asked me to ring him and speak to him and his agent and try to tell him to listen and sign.",
      "\"I remember his agent saying, 'Rio, it doesn't matter what money they offer him, he won't sign. He feels he has been disrespected, so that's it'. As much as I was disappointed, I respected it.\"",
      "However, signing Tevez from under Ferguson's nose wasn't enough for City, who commissioned a billboard to rub their rivals' face in it. David Pullan was Cityâs chief brand and marketing officer and wanted to make a grand statement.",
      "Pullan masterminded the 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard and persuaded club chiefs to commission it",
      "âHe didnât want to run it because he felt it was antagonistic towards United fans at a time when the whole Abu Dhabi ethos was to be respectful,â Pullan told The Athletic.",
      "âThey [the owners] didnât want to play that game of being antagonistic. I sat down with him and said, âLook, this isnât a big two fingers up at United. Itâs tongue-in-cheek, itâs funny, itâs a way of showing our fans that, despite all the changes and all the money coming into the club, we still understand them and we still care about them. We arenât being disrespectful'.",
      "\"Itâs celebratory. Itâs the first opportunity for City fans to celebrate getting one over on their old rivals, so why not? He was persuaded that it wasnât a negative thing to do. The fans loved it. And the rest is history.â",
      "The billboard was positioned in the heart of town in Deansgate. The artwork was soon splattered with red paint and it continued to be targeted by angry fans.",
      "Pullan continued: âEvery morning, there would be socks filled with red paint lying on the street at the bottom of the poster. Overnight, the United fans would come down with tins of red paint, fill up these socks and throw them at the poster to try to turn it red.\"",
      "The billboard cost Â£30,000, but Pullan described it as \"one of the most valuable pieces of marketing ever\".",
      "The world was listening when Ferguson responded to the stunt. \"The billboard in Manchester is just City all over, isn't it? They are a small club with a small mentality, and all they can talk about is Manchester United,\" he said.",
      "\"That's all they've done and they can't get away from it. The poster is a stupid thing using Tevez in that way and they've shown an arrogance which does them no favours.",
      "\"It's clear that it's a go at us because they think taking Tevez away from Manchester United is a triumph. But it's poor stuff. I thought Tevez would go to City a long time ago, so it didn't come as any surprise.\"",
      "Ferguson continued: \"There is an edge being put on us because of all the buying City have done. For me, City's biggest triumph could simply be getting those players to the club. I don't know if they will do anything.",
      "\"It's not easy to get into that top four. City's spending is demoralising only if you panic about the buying. They have the money, and when they offer it, most of it will be cash.",
      "\"But, at the end of the day, Everton did well against us, they did brilliantly against Liverpool and well against Chelsea last season. So it will not be easy for City and they don't even come into my equation at all.",
      "\"I don't look upon City as my biggest challenge. The best City team against the best Everton team is still a game, isn't it? For all the buying they have done, they still have to pick a team with balance.",
      "\"And that won't be easy for Mark. What's he got, eight strikers? So if he picks a squad to go to Chelsea he has to leave four behind. He has to deal with that and I know it will not be easy.\"",
      "Ferguson's response caused a stir in the Etihad boardroom. âThe fact it irritated him caused a bit of a wobble with the owners. They didnât want to take him on, head-on,\" Pullan explained.",
      "\"They didnât want to make it out that City was the future, United were the past. We werenât trying to annoy Ferguson, but the fact he allowed himself to get annoyed by something so small tells you everything about the direction of travel at that time.",
      "\"It wasnât the intention, but the fact it got to him would have been seen, certainly among the fans, as a very positive side-effect.â",
      "Tevez later scored a brace in a 2-1 win against United in the League Cup semi-final and sprinted to the touchline with a message for Gary Neville, gesturing that he talked too much.",
      "Neville had spoken in the media to say United were justified in not signing Tevez. The tensions between the clubs continued to simmer and reached boiling point when City visited Old Trafford in the league.",
      "United won 4-3 thanks to a late Michael Owen goal, and Ferguson gave Cityâs chief communications officer, Vicky Kloss, the hairdryer treatment for the 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard in the tunnel.",
      "Ferguson believed Kloss had been responsible for the stunt. \"The goal for this club is to win the league, it doesn't matter what we do against Man City. We want to be at the top,\" he said after the game.",
      "\"Okay, at the moment, we have a neighbour and sometimes they're noisy. You cannot do anything about that. You just have to get on with your life. The demonstration of our playing power was obvious to everyone, we were fantastic today.\"",
      "Tevez was involved in more controversy at the end of the 2011/12 season when he waved a banner reading 'RIP Fergie' during a title-winning parade.",
      "The banner was intended to respond to Fergusonâs claim that \"not in his lifetime\" would City be superior in Manchester, but it was widely considered distasteful, and City apologised.",
      "A City spokeswoman said: \"The creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in accepting and brandishing it, Carlos has made a significant error of judgment.",
      "\"The club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United Football Club for any offence or distress caused.\"",
      "Tevez attempted to clarify: \"I got carried away in the excitement of the moment and I certainly didn't mean any disrespect to Sir Alex Ferguson, who I admire as a man and a manager.\"",
      "United were happy with City's statement and it seemed the incident had been put to bed, but Tevez stoked the fire again when speaking to Spanish media. âIt seems like Ferguson is the president of England,\" he said.",
      "\"Because every time he speaks badly of a player or when he always talked rubbish about me, I never went out to say he had to apologise. When you mess up you should go out and apologise, but I do not apologise.â",
      "Despite there appearing to be some bad blood between Tevez and Ferguson, the player insisted in 2016 there was no fallout.",
      "âWith Ferguson, nothing bad happened, it was a normal relationship. I went to United for two years on loan, and in the final year, Ferguson told me that they were going to buy me permanently,\" he said.",
      "âWe got to the Champions League final in Rome and I didnât have any contract on the table, even though theyâd spent the whole year telling me that, so I went to City and they complained, but I never had the option of signing for United, so I was free.â",
      "Ferguson did not speak to Tevez after his exit and was unimpressed to learn some of his squad remained friendly with him. \"Carlos Tevez was my close friend, but I was not pleased when he joined Manchester City,\" Patrice Evra said.",
      "ââCarlitoâ, I said. âWhat are you doing? This shirt isnât you. I have been to your house and you still have a picture of yourself wearing a United shirt near your pool table. You are a Red, you know deep in your heart that you are a Redâ. Deep down, I think he still had a great affection for United.",
      "\"He once told me that he would always respect United fans. I know he did well for City, I know he was a great player for them, but heâd won league titles and the Champions League with United.\"",
      "Tevez was sold by City to Juventus in 2013 having won the Premier League and FA Cup during his time at the Etihad.",

      "Manchester United reportedly failed in their attempts to sign another high-profile forward before the summer transfer window closed.",
      "United made five new additions to their squad this summer; namely Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens - who all headed to Old Trafford. Lammens was the club's final signing of the window, with his deal being confirmed on deadline day.",
      "It was not merely just incomings which saw United have a busy transfer window - with several players leaving the club. In terms of forwards, United sanctioned the exits of Marcus Rashford, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho before last week's deadline.",
      "A report from Foot Mercato in France has claimed that Garnacho's exit in particular saw United enter the market for a new forward. It has been claimed that the Reds made an attempt to try and sign Lyon star Malick Fofana to replace Garnacho on the left wing, while also reacting to the injury to Cunha before the deadline.",
      "However, the report claims that United never received a green light from Fofana's representatives for a swoop to take place. This was despite the 20-year-old apparently been keen on joining United if any deal could be struck-up between the two clubs.",
      "United already made significant changes to their forward line this summer with the arrivals of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko. It remains to be seen if the interest in Fofana was genuine, and if so, whether or not a proposed move could be revisited during the January window.",
      "Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Everton were all credited with an interest in signing Fofana - while the summer transfer window was open.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was spotted at Ipswich Town's Championship clash against Sheffield United on Friday night.",
      "Blades' boss Ruben Selles is under pressure, having lost the opening five games of their Championship campaign - after narrowly missing out on promotion last season.",
      "Sheffield United were defeated 2-1 by Sunderland in the play-off final last year, parting ways with manager Chris Wilder following that disappointing defeat and it's been a torrid start to the season for the new Blades manager.",
      "The Tractor Boys made light work of Sheffield United this evening, too, winning 5-0 with a hat-trick from Jaden Philogen, a Jack Clarke finish and George Hirst strike, which leaves the Blades rock bottom of the division.",
      "Solskjaer's appearance at Portman Road prompted some speculation online, suggesting the former United boss could be a contender to take over at Bramall Lane if Sheffield United parted ways with Selles.",
      "However, there's likely a more simple explanation. Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna is also a former Manchester United coach and was actually part of Solskjaer's backroom staff during his time as Old Trafford boss.",
      "McKenna and Michael Carrick were promoted to assistant coaches under Jose Mourinho and they stayed with the club following his departure and Solskjaer's appointment.",
      "The pair are close friends from their time at Old Trafford, with McKenna leaving United in 2021 for Ipswich. He's since helped guide the Tractor Boys from League One up to the Premier League last season - but his side were relegated back to the Championship this summer.",

Sometimes itâs hard to point why, the performance, the moment, the bad luck in some moments was hard on him. Our thinking was to have a change with the goalkeepers, but I wish the best with Andre Onana. He was really good at working and helping the players. But sometimes you need to change the environment.\"",

      "We want to maintain that, I donât want to be the guy to break that record, or that idea. If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids who grow up here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future, so I should try maintain that, that is for sure.\"",
      "\"I think sometimes to connect with Andre. Andre Onana did a very good season in Inter, the quality is there but in the club sometimes things is getting harder and harder but in this club the pressure is so hard in every detail sometimes you need a change. I believe in Altay he is ready to play.\"",

      "The winger travelled to Spain on a private jet alongside his agent, Junior Pedroso, to complete a move to Betis with hours of the transfer window remaining. United received a fixed fee of â¬22million (Â£19m), with a potential â¬3m (Â£2.6m) in add-ons, and included a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal.",

      "As of the final days of August, Onana was adamant he would stay at United. However, his error-strewn performance in the humiliating League Cup second round elimination by fourth tier Grimsby Town preceded his demotion for the Premier League win against Burnley three days later. Sources say Onana effectively felt forced out following the arrival of the 23-year-old Lammens.",
      "United had not considered a new goalie to be a priority in the window but head coach Ruben Amorimâs view of Onana evolved to the extent that he picked Altay Bayindir over the Cameroonian in the opening league fixtures against Arsenal and Fulham.",

      "Paul Pogba has shared a mysterious message on social media as he edges closer to his return to professional football following a two-year absence.",
      "The former Manchester United midfielder hasn't featured since testing positive for a banned substance during his second stint at Juventus, but is now firmly on the road back to action. The Frenchman's initial four-year suspension was cut to 18 months following an appeal, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling his doping violation was 'not intentional', clearing him to resume playing in March 2025.",
      "The wait has extended slightly beyond that timeframe, but Pogba, whose Â£89million return from Juventus is still United's record transfer, has secured a new club in Monaco. Perhaps after looking back on a difficult four years, Pogba had a cryptic message for his Instagram followers.",
      "In an 11-word message uploaded to his social media page, he said: \"You stay grounded in faith, even when the path isn't clear.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Pogba was handed a provisional October comeback date upon his arrival at Stade Louis II, though manager Adi Hutter seems prepared to allow him additional time to reach the standard required for top-level performance. According to reports in France, Hutter doesn't anticipate having Pogba available before the October international break but is optimistic about his return shortly afterwards.",
      "Speaking about the Frenchman, Hutter said: \"After the next international break, I think we'll be able to see him play for AS Monaco. He's on the right track.",
      "\"It's taking a little longer than for Ansu (Fati, who arrived on loan from Barcelona), but he's doing well. I wouldn't say I'm surprised, but I'm impressed by what he's doing every day to come back. He's a very professional player. I hope to see him again after the next international break.\"",
      "Pogba's projected return date suggests he may not be fit in time to face Manchester City in the Champions League on October 1. However, Hutter has included him in Monaco's Champions League squad, meaning the French international could potentially play later in the league phase against Tottenham, Real Madrid or Juventus.",
      "The World Cup-winning midfielder was visibly moved in his signing video and discussed the moment with club media. He said: \"It's true that I was overwhelmed with emotion at that moment.",
      "\"I must say that it's very rare to see me cry like that, so I hope you enjoyed it. A lot of images that came to mind, in relation to what I went through.",
      "\"So to come back and sign for AS Monaco, for a club that believed in me, all of that came back to me at the moment of my signing, which meant that I couldn't hold back.",
      "\"But above all, it was a moment of joy! But I also feel a lot of determination in me, and I think I made the best choice in coming here.\"",
      "Monaco secured third place in Ligue 1 last season to earn Champions League qualification and currently sit fourth in the table following three matches of the new campaign. On Saturday they make the trip to Auxerre with the aim of claiming their first away points of the new season.",

      "Manchester United rebuilt their frontline without maintaining the engine over the summer.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked bright this season, while the jury is most definitely still out on Benjamin Sesko. The club is more than aware they will often find themselves overpaying for players, as a result of reckless and vast spending habits from the past.",
      "A Â£100million price-tag was slapped on Carlos Baleba, who remained at Brighton and Hove Albion this summer. In and amongst the headlines linking the Cameroonian to Old Trafford, Adam Wharton was pirouetting and passing his way through games under the radar at Crystal Palace.",
      "With his buzzcut short back and sides, rolled down socks and modest goals and assists tally - seven goals and 18 assists in 147 appearances in all competitions including the Championship - Wharton has not been heralded in the media like many of his English counterparts. His less than glamorous exterior may prompt many to brand him a hard worker, rather than the technically gifted maestro he is.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He is dictating games for Palace, moving the ball forward at will and acting as a defensive blanket for his backline. Elliott Anderson grabbed the headlines, rightly, for his display against Serbia for England, but it may have been Wharton's name up in lights, had the Palace man not pulled out of the squad with an injury.",
      "The lack of external hype in his game is reflected in his CIES Observatory ranking, which states a \"fair market\" value for his services is between Â£39m and Â£46m.",
      "It's far away from Palace's purported Â£100m price tag - a figure slated as \"mad\" and \"daft\" by Jamie Carragher - but's it's a significant rise from his January value of Â£28m, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "It could rise even further, as reports from the Sun before transfer deadline day claimed Wharton has Real Madrid's attention. The Spanish powerhouses have been sniffing out free agents like bargain hunting sharks.",
      "But, their interest in Wharton, whose deal at Selhurst Park does not expire until 2029, suggests they view the midfielder as an investment potentially worth making.",
      "Real Madrid know few players turn them down. The European heavyweights will happily wait for contracts to expire or prices to drop when they've planted visions of the iconic white shirt and the Bernabeu in their target's mind.",
      "United still hold significant cache, as Cunha and Mbeumo's snubbing of Newcastle and Tottenham respectively, has demonstrated. But this will continue to wane with every poor campaign.",
      "The Red Devils may need to act fast, maybe even in January, if they want to bring Wharton to United. If a bidding war with Real Madrid takes place, Los Blancos will fancy their chances.",
      "They may not have the stomach to win a financial bidding war, but they are in a better position to win the player's minds. Wharton may not get the crowd of their feet with goals and assists, but he can plug all sorts of holes in the United midfield, in which there are many.",
      "In the same way United pinpointed their forward line targets in the summer window just gone, similar action may be needed for the Palace ace next year.",

      "Kai Rooney has been making waves with Manchester United's academy, but has suffered the first substantial injury setback of his career.",
      "The 15-year-old, son of United legend Wayne, shared a photo of himself on social media with his foot in a protective boot.",
      "It is unclear at the time of writing how long the teenager will be out of action, but his caption of \"Life can't get worse\" points to how heartbroken he is at being unable to play the game he loves.",
      "Kai, who has rapidly risen through the age groups in United's academy, is far from the first member of a footballing dynasty to make waves - either at their famous father's club or elsewhere.",
      "We've already United give minutes to sons of famous fathers who plied their trade elsewhere.",
      "Johan Cruyff's son Jordi spent time at Old Trafford in the 90s, while Daley Blind joined United in between spells at the Ajax team where his father Danny served as player and manager, and Diego Forlan's father Pablo played at two World Cups for Uruguay.",
      "There are plenty of United players in the Premier League era alone who have seen their sons follow their lead, and we've looked at just a few of those family dynasties.",
      "Unlike his centre-back father, Lorenz Ferdinand is a goalkeeper. The 19-year-old has come through Brighton's academy, playing twice in the 2023/24 FA Youth Cup, and signed his first pro contract with the Seagulls this summer after a year out on loan.",
      "Born in London when his father Robin played for Arsenal, Shaqueel van Persie is now 18 and a Dutch youth international. The forward has begun his career at Feyenoord, where his dad took over as first team manager in February, and has played for the Rotterdam side's academy in the UEFA Youth League.",
      "United legend David's middle son Romeo had a bit of a false start to his football career, spending time out of the game after a stint in Arsenal's academy. After returning to the game with Inter Miami, he had a year with Brentford's B team but ended up hanging up his boots for good at the age of 22.",
      "Kasper Schmeichel was just seven years old when he was pictured during United's double celebrations with father Peter in 1994, but 22 years later he became a Premier League champion in his own right. Now 38, the former Leicester and Manchester City keeper is on Celtic's books.",
      "Scotland international midfielder Darren came through United's academy before winning the Champions League with the club, and his twin sons are looking to follow suit. England Under-18 midfielder Jack was on the bench for five Premier League games last term, while his brother Tyler has played in the same team as him for United's Under-21s this season.",
      "Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo fired United to trophies in the first of two Old Trafford spells, and his 15-year-old son - also named Cristiano - made his Under-15s debut for Portugal in May. The teenager, currently in the academy of his father's club Al Nassr, scored twice for his country's under-15s in a win against Croatia this year.",
      "Jamaica striker Johnson came through United's academy but arguably played his best football with Nottingham Forest. His son Brennan also made a big impact at the City Ground, and scored the winner against United for Tottenham Hotspur in last season's Europa League final.",
      "Henrik's Manchester United spell was short but sweet, and son Jordan - like Brennan Johnson - came back to haunt his father's former club. The Sweden international, who has also played club football in Russia and Germany, was part of the FC Copenhagen side which stunned United in the 2023/24 Champions League - though he missed a penalty in the reverse fixture",
      "Plenty of former United stars have carved out solid lower-league careers, including Andy Cole's son Devante and Steve Bruce's son Alex (who also had a couple of years in the Premier League). Paul Ince's son Tom has been a real mainstay up and down the pyramid, though, coming through the academy of United's rivals Liverpool and is now closing in on a 500th senior league appearance at the age of 33."

The defender played a key role in helping United reach the Europa League final last season and was one of the most consistent performers for Amorim and former manager Erik ten Hag - often finding himself filling in at other positions when his teammates suffered injuries as well as making an impact in his favoured right-back slot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United will be delighted to have the full-back, who can also play on the left or in the centre of defence, back available after the international break. The 27-year-old recently spoke about what it's like working with Amorim, including the expectations from the United head coach.",
      "\"He is a great manager, a great person. I really love to work with him. I like him a lot,\" Mazraoui said in an interview with The National.",
      "\"His way of thinking, his way of managing, his way of talking. He's like a manager with a lot of values, which I have the same. So, yeah, that works great together.\"",
      "He also opened up on his own fitness as he vowed to 'be fit and ready' for as many games as possible.",
      "\"On a personal level, my fitness and the amount of games I played, I can look back to a good season,\" he said. \"In fitness, the Premier League is always different than the other competitions.",
      "\"No winter break, obviously. The games were following up really fast.\" He added: \"You hope to stay fit and play as much as possible. That hadn't always been the case for me.",
      "\"The Premier League is a bigger demand than other competitions, so you must take even more of your body. I had a switch in my mindset - be fit and ready and I think that helped me play so many games.\"",
      "Those words may well have given United the injury boost that could change their season due to the defender's versatility to play across the entire backline - and Amorim will no doubt be keen for Mazraoui to be back to his best as soon as possible.",

      "Wistfully, we reminisced over our personal favourites. Winty went for David Silva because, well, heâs magic. Continuing the theme of pint-sized sorcerers, Joe Williams opted for Juninho. Some other names thrown around the desk: Cantona, Klinsmann, Hazard, Henry, Agueroâ¦",
      "So no consensus there over the best nation to import from. Come to think of it, how do we answer that question?",
      "We could build an algorithm to mine the dataâ¦ f*** that. Spelling âalgorithmâ is arduous enough for a Friday, weâre definitely not building one.",
      "Like the rest of the nationâs workforce, we hoped AI might help us get an early dart to the pub. ChatGPTâs answer: âFrance for quantity and consistency; Portugal and Spain for elite influence.â Thanks for f*** all.",
      "No, instead of digging deep ourselves to answer this question, weâre mining our greatest resource: the knowledgeable and devilishly-handsome F365 readers. You started it, so you can finish it.",
      "So get involved, first by giving a simple answer to a complex question in the poll below.",
      "Then head Below The Line to state your case, and offer up your favourite individual imports. Weâve given you some stats and numbers below if thatâs your thing.",
      "Be warned: discussing your personal foreign hero can quickly descend into a game of âname the most random foreign player you can think ofâ and, instantly, productivity plummets to zero. So you might as well get off now and do it in the pub anywayâ¦",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start ahead of Senne Lammens against Man City in the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",
      "After bringing in Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day, Onana was allowed to join Trabzonspor on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Reports have claimed that Amorim saw Onanaâs exit from Old Trafford as key to his rebuild of the club and it was felt that the Cameroon international âwas showing a lack of involvement and interest in working for the team in the final days before the international break.â",
      "Itâs not yet clear whether Lammens has been brought in as number one or to challenge Bayindir but Amorim confirmed on Friday that the latter is starting against Man City on Sunday.",
      "READ:Â Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Amorim told a press conference: âAltay is going to continue. It is a different league, a different country, different training, different ball. So we will try to maintain that and they will fight for the position but for me in this game is clear, Altay will start.â",
      "On Lammens, the Man Utd boss added: âHe is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. I know that we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience. We are also in the moment where we have to look at the present but also with a focus on the future â so it is a little bit of both. Heâs a guy with a great potential that is one more option [for us] to play, and he will be ready.â",
      "When asked why Man Utd signed Lammens over Aston Villaâs Emi Martinez, Amorim continued: âWe have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years so that was out choice in the end.â",
      "On why Onana had to leave Old Trafford, Amorim said:Â âI think we understood that this needed a change and sometimes it is hard to point out why. Sometimes it is the moment, the bad luck in some moments.",
      "âIt is hard on him, on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana.",
      "âHe was really good at working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.â",
      "Injured trio Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot, who cost Man UtdÂ Â£136.5m in total, will be missing against Man City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim said of the trio: âThey are out for this game. I donât know how long it is going to take. We need our guys to be a very competitive team but we have very good players who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday but they are out. They cannot help us in this game.â",
      "When asked how long they will be out for, Amorim replied:Â âI donât want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I donât know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing.â",
      "A âabsolutely hopelessâ Manchester United star has been blasted ahead of this weekendâs derby against Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is one of the players on Juventusâ list to replace Dusan Vlahovic in Turin, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "Man Utd are increasingly âunhappyâ at how head coach Ruben Amorim deals with certain situations in the media, according to reports.",

      "âHe needs a regular run. I donât think heâs had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "âThere were reports that he wasnât quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think heâs going to prove a real key player next season.â",

      "After talks between Fernandesâ agent,Â Miguel Pinho, and the Saudi club, the Man Utd captain decided to stay at the Premier League club for the time being.",
      "Revealing why he opted to stay at Man Utd over a move to Saudi, Fernandes â who has also attracted interest from Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad â said:Â âThe president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it.",
      "âThere was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",

      "Fernandes added:Â âIt was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "âThen, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "âIt was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",

      "The report continues: âThe English club is experiencing financial difficulties and could seriously consider selling one of its most valuable assets if an attractive offer comes in. Fernandes is entering the final stretch of his contract, increasing the pressure to define his future.â",

      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If itâs United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",

      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next weekâs trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end Cityâs Premier League season before weâve even reached the second international break.",

Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadnât given a momentâs thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nunoâs midnight axe.",
      "Really, itâs just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. Thatâs just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way theyâve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what youâve lost.",
      "Or, of course, thereâs the other option, which is to look at whatâs worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad youâd built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "Itâs a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. Itâs a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesnât.",
      "If youâre not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Angeâs patented inspirational team talks.",
      "Thereâs a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. Itâs just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "Itâs unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the playersâ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant âWTF?â impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",
      "Lose, and he can just come out in the post-match interview and say âWarra trophy, mateâ and he still wins. Perfect.",
      "",
      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. Weâve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really donât actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that heâs short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, itâs very possible â likely even â that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "Thatâs only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, theyâre likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier Leagueâs best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "West Hamâs 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",
      "Kneejerk assessments had been made of West Ham in the previous fortnight, and the consensus was clear: they were rubbish, and many people feared for them, they really did. We did. We do.",
      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammersâ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last seasonâs Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenhamâs bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham havenât lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinhoâs first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didnât look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",
      "",
      "The real El Clasicoast returns as a league fixture for the first time since a 2-2 Championship draw in April 2012, and 13 years in which assorted miseries have befallen both clubs. Especially Southampton, but especially Portsmouth.",
      "A Premier League team in 2010 became a League Two one by 2013 and itâs been a long slow climb back to the second tier and renewed acquaintances with their local rivals.",
      "Southampton themselves were in League One during Portsmouthâs final Premier League season, and just seven years later were completing a fourth successive season in the top flightâs top eight under managers like Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman.",
      "They then fell off, bobbed around a bit and last year, as Portsmouth finally dragged themselves back up into the Championship, Southampton tumbled back into it after the second worst Premier League season in history.",
      "And itâs Portsmouth whoâve now made the better start to this season ahead of the short trip to St Maryâs.",

      "Juventus havenât, in truth, been wholly convincing against either Parma or Genoa, but two wins from two games without conceding a goal is never to be sniffed at.",

World-record signing Grace Geyoro could come straight into the side, while a thin-looking United squad could well be a touch weary after a 1-0 midweek defeat in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Brann.",

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "People will say Amorim has created much of his own mess at Old Trafford with his tactical stubbornness and outspoken, speak-before-you-think nature in press conferences and interviews.",
      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ:Â Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hagâs first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending Â£227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of âhis own playersâ. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined Â£166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utdâs hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu â a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coachâs 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation thatâs still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",
      "Onana has now followed Ten Hag signings Antony and Hojlund out under Amorimâs watch.",
      "Those are three extremely expensive mistakes. There are suggestions that Ten Hag preferred other strikers, like Harry Kane, over Hojlund, but thereâs no doubt the Dutchman desperately wanted Antony and Onana, both of whom he managed at Ajax.",
      "The goalkeeper situation was one Amorim wanted to address in the summer but knew it was easier said than done with more pressing issues in attack and a restricted budget.",
      "A pre-season injury suffered by Onana got the ball rolling, as Man Utd ended up signing Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the 29-year-old falling from first to third choice in just two months.",
      "Signed for a reported Â£47m from Inter, Onana has now joined Trabzonspor, who finished seventh in last seasonâs Turkish Super Lig, on a season-long loan.",
      "Itâs another catastrophic transfer loss for Man Utd, who thought they were getting a world-class goalkeeper but ended up with one of the most error-prone and least commanding keepers in the clubâs recent history.",

      "Manchester United reportedly made a late move to sign Lyon winger Malick Fofana on deadline day after agreeing to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea.",
      "Ruben Amorim endured a miserable first season in charge at Old Trafford, guiding Man Utd to a 15th-placed Premier League finish and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Despite missing out on Champions League football â and the Â£100m windfall that comes with it â INEOS still backed Amorim heavily in the summer window.",
      "Man Utd spent more than Â£200m, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko strengthening the attack, alongside goalkeeper Senne Lammens and young wing-back Diego Leon.",
      "Going into the window, Amorim had decided that Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were not part of his long-term plans.",
      "READ: Barcelona want to âsend Rashford homeâ to Man Utd? Of course they doâ¦",
      "By September 1, only Malacia remained. Antony, Garnacho and Sancho all departed on deadline day after months of speculation.",
      "Garnachoâs Â£40m move to Chelsea could have freed space and funds for another forward, especially after Cunha picked up an injury against Burnley on August 30.",
      "And according to Foot Mercato, Man Utd tried to do exactly that by approaching Lyonâs Malick Fofana.",
      "The Belgian winger had already been linked with Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest earlier in the summer, and Man Utd entered the race late on.",
      "Itâs claimed that âbehind the scenesâ the Red Devils âpushed to try to snatchâ the Lyon forward.",
      "Though not his direct agent, Jorge Mendes is said to have acted as an intermediary between United and Fofanaâs father.",
      "The report suggests Fofana was âtempted by the idea of joiningâ United, but the club âwaited for a signal from the playerâs fatherâ to begin negotiations.",
      "That signal never arrived, and with it, Fofanaâs immediate future was sealed at Lyon.",
      "As Foot Mercato put it:",
      "We obviously start withÂ Malick Fofana. While the name of the Belgian nugget from OL has been circulating at Everton, Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Chelsea, another club behind the scenes pushed to try to snatch the Lyon striker in the last two days of the transfer window when Garnacho left Manchester United and Matheus Cunha was injured against Burnley on August 30th.",
      "Under the impetus of Jorge Mendes who played the intermediary between Manchester United and the playerâs father, the Red Devils tried their luck. While the Belgian international was tempted by the idea of ââjoining MU, the English club was just waiting for a signal from the playerâs father to start hostilities. A signal that never came and which sealed Fofanaâs future between RhÃ´ne and SaÃ´ne.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United failed with a âcrazy attemptâ to sign a Liverpool target âin the last two daysâ of the summer transfer window.",

      "A Liverpool target has âdecided to stayâ at Lyon this summer despite Nottingham Forest seeing a bid accepted earlier in the window, according to reports.",
      "Romano has revealed that Liverpool have held âinternal talksâ over a Luis Diaz replacement but insists Alexander Isak is the âpriorityâ, with âtalks progressing wellâ.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed Liverpool interest in Lyon winger Malick Fofana in the summer transfer window.",
      "Liverpool are looking to bring in Lyon winger Malick Fofana as a potential replacement if Luis Diaz leaves for Bayern Munich, according to reports."

      "We were baffled by the response when we had Newcastle that high less than two months ago. Fair enough, weâre less baffled now. Because what we actually were was wrong. Desperately, badly wrong.",
      "Sometimes it takes a big man to admit theyâve made a mistake. And sometimes the mistake is writing âNo apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players â most notably of course Alexander Isakâ and you are so bang to rights you have no choice but to admit youâve f*cked it.",
      "It was hilariously soon after those fateful words that the whole Alexander Isak Saga kicked off and so dominated the final six weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The good news, at least, is that we are no longer baffled by Newcastle fans feeling down in the dumps, and that surely must lift their spirits significantly. Guys? Guys? No? Fair enough, suit yourselves.",
      "As bad as the drawn-out and bitter Isak saga was the ritual humiliations Newcastle endured in trying to source a suitable replacement, and the fact that when they eventually did in bringing Yoane Wissa to St Jamesâ Park, it played out in such a way that they all had to look awkwardly at their shoes or abandon all semblance of self-awareness after spending the previous weeks declaring Isakâs open disloyalty had brought indelible and grave shame on him and his legacy for the rest of days.",
      "Newcastle did also manage to sign Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but â while weâre loathe to jump to any conclusions â weâre not sure thereâs ever been a more conspicuous and desperate example of the Bundesliga Tax. Suffice to say this was one deal where Newcastle were in absolutely no danger of being hijacked or gazumped at the last by a rival bid.",
      "On the field, itâs been a largely grim start to the season. The goalless draws against Villa and Leeds exposed the already very obvious weakness in Newcastleâs squad to a sarcastic degree, while the admirable heart and fight shown with 10 men against Liverpool only ended up exposing them to the most sickening of sucker-punches.",

      "Not for a team that was giddily winning six matches in a row, scoring 15 goals in the process, only five months ago.",
      "And yet it also feels just so predictable. That run ended any lingering relegation concerns for Wolves, but when they followed it by taking just a single point from the four remaining games of the season you already just knew how this one would begin.",
      "A maddening exercise in self-fulfilling prophecies at this point. Sure, theyâll probably be fine in the end. History tells us that.",
      "But history also tells us that a club that has had managerial changes in June 2021, October 2022, August 2023 and December 2024 might have to also make a sacrificial lamb Vitor Pereira in order to fulfil the prophecy. And that just feels like a terrible waste.",

      "There has perhaps been no individual result across the early days and weeks of this season more water-muddying than West Hamâs genuinely inexplicable 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest.",
      "It was a result that provided Mr Marinakis just enough cover to make the managerial change he â and increasingly obviously by the end even Nuno Espirito Santo himself â wanted to make at the City Ground, but what if anything does it mean for West Ham?",
      "Until then, it was all very straightforward: absolutely everything was f*cked. The team was playing football the fans hated at a stadium the fans hate under owners the fans hate and a manager whose departure already seemed to be a case of when not if.",
      "They had been slapped silly on the opening day by Sunderland, mercilessly thrashed by Chelsea, and dumped out of the Carabao by rock-bottom Wolves despite leading 2-1 going into the final 10 minutes at Molineux.",
      "A shambolic early exit from the Carabao on the back of chastening defeat to giddy promoted team and a shortcomings-exposing paddling from a title contender just appeared such classic staging posts on the road to an early managerial change that any other course of action appeared unthinkable.",
      "And then came those crazy closing minutes at the City Ground to cast doubt upon everything we thought we knew.",

      "But they didnât and so in the end it did. And it was such a stupid defeat, too, to such a stupid team. And the significance of its consequences are already starting to be laid bare.",
      "From Emi Martinezâs absurd red card against the team he would later unsuccessfully attempt to join to one of the more ridiculous disallowed goals weâve ever seen in the VAR era, you have to be wilfully obtuse not to understand Villa fansâ gnawing frustration and hurt about it all.",
      "It shouldnât necessarily have felt quite so much like a sudden jolting stop to three years of progress, and if last season taught us anything itâs that the Europa League can cover a multitude of sins, but it did feel like something ended that day.",
      "Having failed to make either Marcus Rashford or Marco Asensioâs blockbuster loan moves permanent, a slightly desperate Villa moved late in the window to throw a vast chunk of Jadon Sanchoâs wages the way of a grateful Manchester United.",
      "It does rather scream of lessons not being learned at a club that continues to teeter and totter on the very brink of PSR ruin with an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "At no other club does the ranting about the unfairness of PSR feel more misplaced than Villa, who will be making all the same noise and looking anywhere but at themselves when they find themselves forced to cash in on Morgan Rogers next summer.",

      "Oh boy. The club is a mess, obviously, the team is a mess, obviously. Manchester United is now a club so consumed by banter that even when losing in the second round of the Carabao â a Carabao round where even just having to play in it while being Manchester United is already a sign of failure â to Grimsby Town isnât the end of the banter.",
      "The revelation that Grimsby fielded an ineligible player in that tie left United in the grip of an inescapable banter prison. They had already committed the seasonâs most humiliating act by losing that game, and were now in a position where they either accepted that fate or looked to profit from either an expulsion or a replay. Which would arguably have been even more humiliating and would certainly have prompted even greater waves of banter.",
      "That the one saving grace of their season currently is managing to scrape past promoted Burnley 3-2 at home in a game where they tossed away two leads before having the good sense to take the third lead so late that not even they could spaff it is revealing in its own way.",
      "They are not very good, and even after spending vast sums of money after spending the last two years pleading poverty and making penny-pinching, miserly savings at the expense of ordinary employees, they are still not very good.",
      "They face Manchester City this weekend in a game that is both derby and an early-season Crisis Club play-off.",

Itâs a return that sits somewhere right towards the top end of reasonable expectation for pretty much anyone outside the Big Six/Eight/Whatever from that set of games.",
      "But the mood is nowhere near as buoyant as it otherwise would be due to the unavoidable sense that Leeds and Daniel Farke were badly let down by the owners in the closing days and weeks of the window.",
      "There was some good work done early on, but the 49ers lads had made a lot of noise about setting Leeds up to truly compete in the Premier League, so to respond to Farkeâs desperate yet obviously correct insistence after the final pre-interlull game that he needed two more attacking players by signing, in fact, no more attacking players has sucked all the early-season optimism out of Elland Road.",
      "Those four points have been amassed via a late and contentious penalty winner against Everton, a goalless draw against an at-the-time similarly toothless Newcastle and an in-your-place hiding from Arsenal. And it does feel rather like a blueprint has been set for Leeds games this year, one where they will be swiftly outclassed by the best and rely on everything going their way and absolutely nothing going wrong against everyone else.",

      "But itâs still a start that comes with concerns and caveats. Their one win was against a fellow promoted side, and shipping three goals in both the games against established Premier League sides is a stark early reminder that âwe will simply concede no goalsâ was never likely to be as effective a survival tool as it was a promotion one.",

They might have muddled through okay until January following the loss of Guehi, but there really wouldnât have been a transfer fee imaginable that could have made up for losing Glasner with the season under way.",

      "And that means that while yes, this is a club well used to constant churn, chop and change, this is still nevertheless a time of even greater flux and uncertainty.",
      "Because for the last 25 years, there behind it all has been Levy, a rare executive chair in a world of non-execs and CEOs.",
      "With his departure, the sands shift once again beneath Tottenhamâs feet. There is huge celebration among plenty of fans who had grown tired and increasingly frustrated by Levyâs supposed penny-pinching and inability or unwillingness to make the sort of transfer splash â and thus accept not always getting the best possible price for every incoming and outgoing â that might allow them a fighting chance at achieving his stated goals of winning one of the two big prizes.",
      "There are others who are wary of the change, more appreciative of the work Levy did to transform Spurs from mid-table sleeping giant into a member of the Big Six. The idea that Levy has been great for Spurs off the pitch but disastrous for them on the pitch has always been a loud and compelling one, with plenty of reasonable frustrations underpinning it.",
      "But itâs also worth remembering that Spurs had been mostly crap on the pitch for most of the 90s having pretty emphatically missed the Premier League Boat they as a club did so much to help launch.",

      "His new-found willingness to front up both for in-house interviews and with Gary Neville on The Overlap hinted at a man who suddenly, for the first time, felt it necessary to try and explain himself. There have been new arrivals that, in hindsight, always looked like they could be used to ease Levy out. Long-time Lewis confidant Peter Charrington â now in position as non-executive chairman â came to the club six months ago, followed by former Arsenal man Vinai Venkatesham.",
      "He is now the CEO and will be the closest thing to a replacement for Levy in the new, more standard structure.",
      "There is a very valid argument that Levy had taken Spurs as far as he possibly could. That everything he had achieved in repositioning the club as a 21st century behemoth off the field would never be replicated on the field while he remained wedded to retaining the Premier Leagueâs lowest wage:turnover ratio.",
      "It might very well be a change that had to happen. Spurs might now compete more robustly in the transfer market with the rest of the Big Six, and are perhaps now in less danger of being instead swallowed up by Aston Villa and Newcastle and other upwardly-mobile members of the Premier Leagueâs middle-classes.",

      "Instead his Bournemouth side have scared the crap out of Liverpool at Anfield, beaten Wolves and then gone with an entirely new-look defence to a full-of-beans Spurs and shut their entire system down entirely in an enormously impressive victory the story of which barely has its surface scratched by a 1-0 scoreline.",

      "But for Chelsea? And as a model in the specific transfer market and football economy that we have today? It is absolutely good.",
      "What you have to do with Chelsea is to stop viewing them as a football club altogether. Itâs a stretch to say the football is incidental, but only a stretch rather than an absurdity.",
      "Chelsea obviously arenât alone in placing significance on the future value of an asset (or âfootballerâ as they used to be called) but are the only club where this at times appears to be the only significance. Or certainly the primary one.",
      "Everyone else is trying â some not as hard as others, looking at you, Aston Villa â to be financially responsible but the obvious primary goal is to build a successful, coherent and functional squad of football players to play actual football matches with an acceptable degree of success.",
      "Thatâs not really the model Chelsea are now pursuing. They will have good teams and good squads and the ensuing on-field success, but that feels more and more like a by-product of the primary business. Which is player trading.",
      "What Clearlake have done is taken what was the necessary evil of player trading and made it the core business. And itâs worth noting that all theyâve actually done is to just go further along a path Roman Abramovich had already started down.",
      "Chelsea now acquire players the way other businesses acquire assets. They might be useful to the side-hustle of trying to win football matches, they might not. Itâs almost stopped mattering â to the business, if not the fans.",
      "The long contracts Chelsea tie their players down to are something we were all guilty of misunderstanding in the early stages. They werenât just a ruse to help with amortisation but that would ultimately stitch them up down the line; they were key to the whole caper.",
      "If youâre signing players as tradeable assets, itâs no use if theyâre just going to be available for free four years later.",
      "Sure, youâre going to run into problems with this approach from time to time and end up paying Raheem Sterling Â£300k a week to train with the youth team, but in the main what Chelsea are doing is protecting the resale value of every player they sign.",
      "Itâs already visible on the balance sheet. The absurd front-end outlays and selling-hotels-to-themselves machinations of the early windows have gone. They have pretty much broken even this window despite another vast outlay running into the hundreds of millions.",
      "Theyâll take a loss here and there, but they make a profit in the round, and every now and then accidentally sign a Cole Palmer who turns out to be a generational talent, so thatâs nice.",
      "Itâs also why blasting players for perceived lack of loyalty is only becoming more and more futile. You can shake your head sadly at Viktor Gyokeres or Alexander Isak doing what they did to âget their moveâ but Gyokeres was entirely right to point out that this is a two-way street and clubs show no loyalty of their own to players they no longer want.",
      "Itâs not a pleasant reality, but this is 2025. We donât do pleasant realities any more.",
      "Chelseaâs multi-club structure helps provide further space to accommodate all the players they acquire, and potential shop windows via loans. And Chelsea know the reality of football right now and the sheer scale of the Premier Leagueâs financial heft means there will (almost) always be takers when itâs deemed time to cash in.",
      "Weâre already at a stage where even Bayern Munich arenât above rummaging around in Chelseaâs garbage and handing over eye-watering sums for the privilege.",
      "Itâs not the transfer model football needs, but it is the transfer model football deserves. One where players are treated not like athletes or even human beings but simply another commodity to be bought and sold.",

      "Giddy and chipper would appear to be that prevailing thought after they sacked the manager who took them to Europe and replaced him with the manager who finished 10 points and 27 points behind them last season.",
      "Which weâd argue is an unusual response to such a scenario. But weâre being facetious, of course. Because Ange Postecoglou is a manager who inevitably prompts giddiness. It is very intoxicating as an idea, is Angeball.",
      "The obvious fear, of course, is that weâve already seen what happens to it after extended exposure to the harsh glare of Premier League reality. And that was with a far more suitable squad.",
      "Weâve already made the point elsewhere that going for Ange at this delicate stage of their encouraging development as an improving Premier League side might prove a damagingly hubristic act, with the mischievous thought that of the two wild high-profile appointments that appealed to Mr Marinakis it really might be that Jose Mourinho was the less damaging.",
      "It really is hard to imagine more directly opposite methods than Nunoâs tight, compact, controlled football that had worked so well and Postecoglouâs chaos. And itâs also worth remembering that the times when Forest did come unstuck last season were often on the occasions when they tried to move away from or beyond what was working so well.",
      "But the squad isnât entirely unsuited to Angeâs ways, especially the attacking players. It does also feel like it will make or quite literally break Elliot Anderson as an elite all-round midfielder.",
      "Itâs the defence that we worry about, though. We suspect Oleksandr Zinchenko possesses the nous and technical quality to work quite well as a Pedro Porro-style full-back-No 10 hybrid, but nothing about the rest of that defence screams âset up camp on the halfway lineâ.",
      "Thereâs nothing wrong with a managerial change providing such a stark shift in style. Itâs often, by definition, precisely what was needed. But it can also be an indicator of chaos, of uncertainty, of a lack of overall clarity in vision.",
      "Weâre not saying for sure which one this is. Just that September is the worst possible month to attempt such a shift. And itâs not like Nuno has been removed because of his on-field methods.",

      "We do, though, just as vividly remember thinking at the time that people saying this would represent a fundamental long-lasting shift in how football fans spoke and treated each other were always going to be well wide of the mark.",
      "And sure enough, two months later, everythingâs gone back pretty much exactly to the way it was before, with the esteemed F365 Mailbox coming in recent weeks to be thoroughly dominated by other fans telling Liverpool they are buying the league and we thought you hated that, and Liverpool fans replying in their definitely not-rattled masses to explain why itâs different, actually.",
      "Nature is healing. And you know what? We think on balance we really wouldnât have it any other way. Sure, we donât all need to be going around being horrible to each other all the time, but at the same time football fandom isnât and shouldnât be some sanitised and pleasant thing. The rivalries, the needle, the niggle are all part of it. When done rightly, like for instance arguing relentlessly about net spend.",
      "One because it makes it slightly less likely they just run away with the league because letâs face it all of us without a dog in the fight would quite like a proper title race again please, but also because it already looks set to make Liverpool even more entertaining to watch even if they do run away with it again.",
      "There is a vulnerability to them that wasnât there last season, and the fact it might not even actually matter at all is sensational.",
      "They are a new-look team that very clearly hasnât fully bedded in yet, have vast scope for improvement, have already had those potential defensive flaws alarmingly exposed by Bournemouth and a 10-man Newcastle side who havenât managed to score another goal anywhere else all season.",
      "And yet theyâve also won three games out of three, including a vital early three points against the team that looks like their biggest and very possibly only meaningful rival.",

They really could be perfect wins, providing both the confidence of belonging at this level by coming against a pair of established Premier League sides, yet also being six-pointer successes against teams that could absolutely be holding the Black Cats above the dropzone when everything starts to get properly real further down the line.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglouâs sacking and the identity of his replacement, itâs also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didnât when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Nevilleâs new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like weâre odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",

      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact theyâve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",

      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Weâre going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a foolâs errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just whoâs going to be good and whoâs not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the âsimply donât concede any goals at allâ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnleyâs start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last seasonâs (relative) struggles. There hasnât been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides heâs had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and itâs always worth remembering that weâre talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional âSack Raceâ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brightonâs season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and theyâd have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton donât make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if youâre a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But itâs still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given theyâve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? Itâs a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Feels both absurdly high to be on this list before a ball is kicked, yet also perfectly fair. Postecoglouâs football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forestâs, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While itâs all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, itâs really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly.",
      "",
      "",
      "It would have made Spursâ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds â and Burnley for that matter â could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away neednât be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesnât bode well for future games against teams who arenât as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Wonât be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palaceâs level thereâs a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work heâs done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, anÂ opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man CityÂ and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "Thatâs what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until heâd had the chance to get a pre-seasonâs worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams whoâve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full âYou fear for themâ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paquetaâs donât-come-and-get-me pleaÂ was impeccably timed. It wouldâve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earthâs most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "The 27-year-old was easily barged out of the way of the ball as Ricardo Calafiori scored the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Old Trafford, despite a dominant United display on the opening day. Bayindir was also flung into the spotlight when he parried the ball into the path of Jaidon Anthony during United's 3-2 win over Burnley last time out.",
      "His performances led to some calls from fans to see Lammens given the nod for the derby; however, Amorim maintains that the club will be feeding players in differently to ensure players thrive at the club.",
      "\"It's not just the pressure of Manchester United, but it's a different club,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are building stability at the club to make new players better. If you go back into the past, this club had a really good base with Roy Keane, Gary Neville, all of these types of guys, but I remember world-class players like [Juan-SebastiÃ¡n] Veron had problems.",
      "\"We had a situation in the past with goalkeepers where we spent a lot of time trying to get a goalkeeper and then Edwin van der Sar came and was like a different player in that position.",
      "\"It's not something that is happening now. It's happening now because we cannot win a lot of titles and that adds more pressure to every player, but we've had these kind of moments at this kind of club.",
      "\"We will try to build stability and a base to help all of these players and we are building that. So in this moment, it's really hard for different players to adapt to this club.\"",
      "Asked who the club's next Van der Sar is, Amorim said:",
      "\"This week I hope to see Altay Bayindir doing well like Van der Sar. Then in the future, they have to fight for the places. We as a team can help the goalkeepers be better. We are doing that.\"",
      "Amorim says it was the right time for both the club and Onana to part ways.",
      "Onana, like Bayindir, was beaten to the ball easily as Grimsby doubled their lead over Man Utd in normal time before United fought back to reach a penalty shootout.",
      "United ultimately lost that game, but Amorim denies the notion that the game influenced Onana's loan departure.",
      "\"Sometimes things are not working in some environments, some moments.",
      "\"I think we, as a club, and Andre felt it was a moment to do a little change. We don't know the future, but it was time to change Onana.",
      "\"You look at the moment and the performance, it's not about Onana's last game, but you can feel the environment. We felt it was a good moment to make a change in that position.\"",
      "Amorim also believes that after the transfer window, he can see more things in the team that he likes. United signed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who helped take Man Utd's spending to Â£232.4m.",
      "Outgoings included Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho, who secured loan moves elsewhere and permanent departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim believes his side are better and that owes to losing the Europa League final, which means fewer games and more time on the training pitch.",
      "\"It's going to take time, but we are better,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I can see more things in my team that I like. More of the things I don't like in my [current] team are more mental because I know the quality is there. We proved in different weekends.\"",
      "\"I think it's hard for the fans, people and some pundits to understand because the Europa League win would have brought us more money to spend and change a lot of things in the team and more games to rotate the team for more players to be happy, but I think we need time.",
      "\"So for me it was the best thing about losing the final, if there can be a best thing. It was time to improve not just the team but also the club.",
      "\"We've shown that a little bit in the games, we play better, we are more dominant, we create more chances, we avoid more chances from the opponent. We are going to use every minute to improve our base. To have our way of playing to be ready for the adaptation, for them to understand every detail of their positions.",
      "Now we have a full week to have a schedule and show the mistakes and now you are showing what you did well in the last game. Now we have more days to focus on the strategy for the next game.\"",

      "Manchester City and Manchester United have a rebuild on their hands, but, despite indifferent starts, have they shown signs of promise going into the new season?;the Manchester derby takes place at the Etihad, live on Sky this Sunday, with kick-off at 4.30pm",
      "Friday 12 September 2025 17:02, UK",
      "The winds of change are sweeping through Manchester.",
      "Manchester City and Manchester United meet at the Etihad on Sunday as the validity of their respective rebuilds continues to be scrutinised.",
      "For the first time in four seasons, the Premier League trophy is in a different home. Tasked with bringing back what has been City's on six of the last eight occasions is Pep Guardiola, but he is in uncomfortable territory.",
      "United are all too familiar with the promise of a rebuild. Ruben Amorim represents the sixth permanent time of asking for a manager at the Old Trafford club to restore the glories of the past.",
      "While for Guardiola, after nine years - his longest spell at a club - he navigates another reboot to restore more recent success, for the first time in his managerial career.",
      "Still yet to provide proof that his footballing concepts can bear fruit, Amorim, on the other hand, must convince fans that a record low finish of 15th in the Premier League was a blip in his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have made an indifferent start to the new season. There was a sense of positivity despite defeat in the season opener to Arsenal. Old habits crept in as United gave away a lead at Fulham and Carabao Cup embarrassment at League Two Grimsby wearied both fans and Amorim himself of whether he could continue as the boss.",
      "After the penalty shoot-out defeat at Grimsby, the Portuguese boss suggested \"something had to change\", implying that it could not be the players, leaving the door open to speculation over his future. Days later, Amorim backtracked on his comments, putting them down to emotion, explaining, \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\".",
      "That frustration perhaps could be borne out of the fact that United are doing the right things but are lacking the results and points to reflect their improvements. United have only scored one goal from open play this season, but the underlying numbers appear much more favourable for United.",
      "It is very early on in the season, but Amorim's side have generated the most expected goals, have had the most shots and created the most chances in the Premier League so far this term, reflecting a freer, flowing attack.",
      "United have also hit the post four times across their three opening fixtures as their new-look forward line attempts to improve on their return.",
      "Incomings in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have made for a more expressive United in forward areas, but there has also been a greater emphasis on a more direct style with United also leading the Premier League in long passes completed.",
      "Signs of improvement extend to United's newly-found willingness to battle, a side of their game that has often been criticised. Only one side has bettered United this season when it comes to duels won and aerial duels won.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for his side's promising numbers to translate into victories. United's win over Burnley before the break was a much-needed one but the Manchester derby offers further opportunity to reflect proof of concept.",
      "Guardiola is the only current manager that Amorim has faced more than once in the Premier League while remaining undefeated.",
      "Amorim beat Guardiola twice during the 2024/25 season, the first as he led Sporting to a 4-1 victory in the Champions League days before taking up his post at Old Trafford. Amad then sealed a late comeback win for Amorim at the Etihad last December. The Manchester derby ended goalless when the two last met in April.",
      "City's unprecedented dip in form last season pushed the club into uncharted territory. Their lowest points total under Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term prompted a summer rebuild. But their woes have dripped into the new season with Guardiola making his worst start to a league campaign since 2008.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne's departure signalled a new era at the Etihad. Summer signings James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders added to January acquisitions of Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Omar Marmoush, among others to create a new-look City under a new director of football, Hugo Viana.",
      "However, with just one win on the table in the Premier League so far, the 'new Man City' have made a stuttering start.",
      "Changes to the technical staff appear to have had some impact. Former Liverpool assistant Pep Ljinders has joined Guardiola in the dugout alongside Kolo Toure. Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man, was famed for his part in Liverpool's dynamic, high-octane approach.",
      "Jamie Carragher, after City's resounding opening victory at Wolves, noted City's \"rock-and-roll\" approach, akin to Klopp's Liverpool.",
      "\"It felt like in the game, it's almost like a little bit of an obsession, certainly in the first half, about catching them offside,\" Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"We always know Pep's team like to push up. We get all that, but that was something a little bit different. It just makes me think of the influence of Pep Lijnders in terms of the offside.",
      "\"When you think of Liverpool as well, keeping back to Pep Lijnders, the amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohammed] Salah, breaking forward. When I looked at the goal from Reinders in the game. It was fantastic.",
      "\"But one of the goals was what you'd think of as a counter-attack, not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal. They win it, and then they're off.\"",
      "A change in approach has been evident. With Cherki now involved and the reintroduction of Oscar Bobb, there has been a slightly greater emphasis on individual flair, with City having completed the most take-ons of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Despite Rodri returning to fitness, City appear to have struggled to control games, giving up their lead over Brighton and being blown away by Thomas Frank's rampant Tottenham. It is that perceived lack of control that will be bothering Guardiola the most ahead of the derby.",
      "United head into the derby above City for the first time in five years, but that does not remove the feeling of trepidation that surrounds Old Trafford at the moment.",
      "The added context of key City absentees in the form of Marmoush and Cherki will offer confidence. As will Amorim's record against Guardiola and City's only win in their last four meetings, being the Community Shield shoot-out victory last season.",
      "Derby games are the proverbial great leveller, but when both sides have been equally uninspiring in terms of results, it becomes a must-win for both managers that could be indicative of the validity of their rebuilds.",

      "The 1-0 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side arrived from a Riccardo Calafiori header after Bayindir failed to command his area, while victory was almost snatched away against Burnley when Bayindir spilled the ball back into his own penalty area for Jaidon Anthony to tap home.",

      "No goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season during his 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League. He also had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "A debut in the derby has been clearly been deemed too much of a risk by Amorim - but it will not be long before Lammens is given a chance to impress.",
      "Breaking into the AC Milan squad as a teenager, playing at the San Siro against rivals Inter at 16, two penalty saves in the shoot-out against England to guide Italy to the Euros title in 2021, Champions League hero and a two-time Yashin Trophy winner.",

      "\"I always try to adapt to the quality of the players,\" said Guardiola at his press conference ahead of the derby.",
      "\"I wouldn't demand 'Gigi' do something he is uncomfortable with. We are talking about the best (goalkeeper) I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson.",

      "That quality is shot-stopping. City have faced 15 shots on target across the opening three games, the most of any side in the top flight, meaning Donnarumma's strength in this area will be welcomed with open arms by Guardiola and his staff.",
      "United lead the league in shots taken so far this season (56) and come in at second behind Liverpool for shots on target (15). Right now, City need a goalkeeper to address that threat. Donnarumma is the perfect option.",

      "Trabzonspor have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Andre Onana from Manchester United on a season-long loan deal.",
      "After a series of errors, Onana had lost his Premier League starting spot at United and now leaves the club following the Â£18.2m arrival of Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on Deadline Day.",
      "Onana made just one appearance for United so far this season, which arrived in the defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town on penalties in the Carabao Cup.",
      "United signed Onana in a Â£47.2m deal from Inter Milan in July 2023.",
      "Despite Onana now away on loan and Bayindir having made a shaky start to the season, Lammens will not start in the Manchester derby on Sunday.",
      "\"Altay [Bayindir] is going to continue because we need to,\" Amorim said. \"This game is clear. Altay will start. It's a show of faith in Altay.\"",
      "\"Lammens, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp - United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years' time.\"",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back to preview all 10 Premier League games with a 4/1 double on his radar.",
      "You couldn't get a more seismic shift in football philosophy from the pragmatism and safety of Nuno Espirito Santo to Ange Postecoglou's front-foot philosophy.",
      "It's a wild appointment from Forest, one showered with risk.",
      "There will be teething problems, especially at the heart of the defence.",
      "Nuno's centre-backs, often protected by a double pivot and narrow shape, were rarely exposed to isolation or high-line races. They weren't expected to be part of the attack, they were there to clear, block and survive. It's what made Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo such an imposing duo last season.",
      "However, Postecoglou doesn't just want control, he wants chaos. The press is high and aggressive. The defensive line creeps ever closer to halfway and centre-backs are no longer shielded - they become part of the plan in possession.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo are going to take time to adapt which means their prices to be carded offer great value while being caught out of possession is going to be extremely likely. Both are 3/1 with Sky Bet to pick up a booking.",
      "This should be full of goals.",
      "Bournemouth press relentlessly, commit bodies forward in numbers, and play with almost a disregard for defensive structure that leaves their centre-backs asked to do lots of one-on-one work. It's high-risk, high-reward football that leads to goals at both ends when the opposition can hurt them. Brighton are the perfect dance partner in that regard with their last 16 away games in all competitions averaging 3.88 goals per game.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line is on offer at 13/8 with Sky Bet and that looks a price to take seriously.",
      "Oliver Glasner is arguably one of the best pound-for-pound managers in world football and his skills are going to be tested over the next few weeks to keep Palace moving forward. Eberechi Eze has gone while Ismaila Sarr and Adam Wharton are both set to be out for this one.",
      "One player who could take advantage of opportunities is Justin Devenny and if you're digging around the player shots market this weekend, him to have a shot on target at 4/5 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy price. With injuries forcing Glasner to shuffle his pack, Devenny looks set to be handed a more attacking remit and he does love to shoot as outlined by his 2.65 shots per 90 data from his appearances for Palace so far.",
      "There was a time when backing goals in an Everton game felt like throwing cash into a firepit. In recent years with Sean Dyche at the helm the football has been functional, efficient and predictable.",
      "They've been an under-goals gamblers dream.",
      "How times have changed though. Everton are now opening up the game. And the arrival of Jack Grealish has added the kind of attacking intent and tempo that's turning David Moyes' team into a great watch. Backing goals in their games looks to be a sweet spot of value to attack as the markets are sleeping and holding too much emphasis on the Dyche days.",
      "Over 2.5 goals here at Evens is one of the best punts of the weekend.",
      "Opposition centre-backs beware - there's a foul drawing supremo playing as the Leeds centre-forward. And as bettors we must try and take advantage of this edge when assessing the player fouls markets.",
      "Lukas Nmecha isn't renowned as a regular goalscorer but what he does do well is the dirty work needed from a striker. He wins fouls, he's good at the dark arts.",
      "Across his last 50 appearances, he's drawing 3.1 fouls per 90 and has drawn four fouls in his first two starts for Leeds. These types of markets rarely adjust foul lines for defenders based on the specific forward they're facing, so there's an angle to exploit here with Joachim Andersen's price of 5/2 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls standing out.",
      "This stinks of a Newcastle to win to nil betting opportunity at 13/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Eddie Howe's side may not get the plaudits they deserve for defensive organisation, but this is a team drilled to an elite level. Despite a tough fixture list of Aston Villa, Liverpool and Leeds, Newcastle have managed the best expected goals against process of any team this season, offering up just 1.58 worth of chances. They've also faced the fewest shots (18), showcasing just how strong they are as a unit.",
      "Meanwhile, without Matheus Cunha injecting his quality and class, Wolves look like a team running out of ideas already in the final third. Boosting the raw Newcastle win price of 2/5 with Sky Bet by adding in the clean sheet looks a smart play.",
      "The narrative of Mohammed Kudus returning to West Ham following his move to Tottenham for Â£55m adds lots of intrigue to an already spicy London derby. Kudus is the first player to join Spurs from West Ham since Scott Parker in 2011 and - as they should - Hammers fans have taken Kudus' move very personally.",
      "He's in for a hot reception and strikes me as a character who will embrace the hostility.",
      "This makes his price of 13/8 with Sky Bet to rack up five or more foul involvements very appealing.",
      "Across his last 50 games in the Premier League playing for West Ham and Spurs, his per 90 foul involvement average is 3.75. And in his four appearances for Spurs already, he's racked up 15 foul involvements.",
      "If you just pull his foul involvement averages against the bigger clubs - in his last 15 appearances against teams that finished in the top 10 of the Premier League and PSG in the Super Cup final, the number comes in at 5.4 per 90. He can hit that average here.",
      "If Chelsea are to challenge for the Premier League title this season, these are the meat-and-drink fixtures that require a no-thrills return of maximum points.",
      "It's something they are becoming very accustomed to doing, though, as Enzo Maresca's side have won 16 of their last 19 games in all competitions. Chelsea are a very reliable team to trust. There's a calmness and control about this team now.",
      "They possess a machine-like quality, quietly getting results in matches they're expected to win. That makes them a dangerous animal for Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City this season.",
      "These newly-promoted teams at home are going to be bigger forces to be reckoned with than last season. Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won five home games between them while the new boys are already at four wins combined from just five matches.",
      "Burnley at Turf Moor can make this scrappy and fiddly for Liverpool. Scott Parker's team are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games and although that run is likely to end here, there will be positive vibes with the players likely to feed off the fact they're very used to winning games in front of their own supporters.",
      "Despite Liverpool's perfect start results-wise, it has been clear they've struggled to find their flow and that stodge may just continue for another week due to the international break limiting time on the training pitch for Arne Slot. The Reds beat Leicester, Wolves and Southampton twice across all competitions by a one-goal margin last season on the road. It's 11/4 with Sky Bet to happen again at Turf Moor.",
      "The Premier League might be back on your screen, and you're ready to go goals galore with your punting after sitting through England vs Andorra for the 32,000th time but the trends suggest this is a time in the calendar where goals drop like a stone.",
      "Players have been flying halfway across the globe and managers have had barely a day or two with their full squads.",
      "The result? Slower starts, lower intensity, fewer chances.",
      "Across the last two seasons, this matchday immediately after the international break, the average goals per game sits at a lowly 2.35 which is way down on the overall average of 3.1 per game during those two seasons.",
      "Also, of the last 40 Premier League games played immediately after the first international break, 20 of them have been 0-0 at the break and the average first half goals scored is 0.9 per game.",
      "Matches can be cagey and this one fits the bill where the market is overplaying the chances of goals. That makes the under 2.5 line at 13/8 with Sky Bet a nice edge to attack in a fixture which has only averaged 2.6 goals per game across the last 10.",
