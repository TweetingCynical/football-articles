      "Manchester United defender Tyrell Malacia has only just returned to training after injury but suffered a scare when the car he was travelling in was crashed into",
      "Tyrell Malacia was taken to hospital after being involved in a collision while travelling team-mate Marcus Rashford's Range Rover.",
      "Manchester United star Rashford was not behind the wheel of the car. It is understood the England international was in a separate vehicle behind his team-mate at the time of the collision, which occurred two days before Rashford was banned from driving for six months.",
      "The Dutch left-back was treated following the crash, as was the driver of the vehicle. According to The Sun, their car was hit by a black Mercedes, whose driver was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.",
      "Malacia is said to have been cleared following checks by doctors. He was spotted in training the day after the incident, as was team-mate Rashford. Mirror Football has contacted Manchester United for comment.",
      "Malacia and Rashford have been involved in different training preparations ahead of the 2024-25 season. Malacia only recently returned after missing the entirety of last season, and has remained in the UK for rehabilitation work with United's medical staff",
      "Rashford is part of Erik ten Hag's squad for United's pre-season tour of the United States. Senior colleagues including Casemiro and Mason Mount have also made the trip, as has new signing Leny Yoro.",
      "Fellow new arrival Joshua Zirkzee remains on leave after The Netherlands' run to the semi-finals of Euro 2024. Altay Bayindir, Diogo Dalot, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Martinez, Facundo Pellistri and Luke Shaw will also link up with their team-mates at a later date following their international exertions.",
      "“We’re looking in all the positions to reinforce,\" United manager Erik ten Hag told reporters in the US when asked about adding reinforcements at left-back. \"But yeah, we need a plan in our squad to assure ourselves that we are always occupied in that position. That's clear.”",
      "United struggled with injuries throughout last season, with Malacia and fellow left-back Shaw not the only ones to miss games. \"One of the things so important in your structures is that you cover that, that fitness part with the medical staff, with performance and that you have to things right,\" Ten Hag said.",
      "\"But also the players, they have to work in the right way because when the standards are so high, then you have to fulfil them. It's only possible when you fulfill the highest standards. It’s not only on game day. On every day.”",
      "After a pair of friendlies in Europe, United will play the first of their US friendlies against Arsenal on Saturday. They will then take on Real Betis and Liverpool, before returning to the UK for the Community Shield.",

      "Manchester United have bought in Ruud van Nistelrooy as an assistant and the ex-forward has been looking to stamp his authority with drills that could change their attacking plan",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy led Manchester United training on Friday with the Dutchman encouraging a change in attacking approach.",
      "The Dutchman, one of the most lethal finishers in Premier League history, has opted to return to Old Trafford and work as a coach under Erik ten Hag. The ex-PSV boss will particularly aid United's productivity in the final third and has been urging them to make more of their wingers.",
      "The Red Devils have based themselves at the Wallis Annenberg Stadium across campus at UCLA and Van Nistelrooy led an attacking drill that saw the respective teams score double points if they scored directly from a cross, with zones coned off to emphasise the areas to attack, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "Van Nistelrooy is clearly attempting to get the United players to further utilise their wide players and highlight the advantages that come from putting balls into the box. The club have some of their most exciting players, the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, operating from out wide.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund proved last term that he was a threat when balls were delivered into the box and that may be a motivation behind United's attacking drills.",
      "The Red Devils were the joint lowest scorers in the Premier League's top ten last term - only finding the net on 57 occasions. That was some 39 less than the league best and was in part down to some of their leading lights in attack failing to fire.",
      "Marcus Rashford was among those to endure a poor campaign, which came after the most prolific season of his career. Ten Hag is hopeful that Van Nistelrooy, who scored 150 times across five seasons in Manchester, can help the forward rediscover his best form.",
      "He said: “That is a reason why he is here, but not only for the strikers. He is much more than this. But Rashford can only prove himself and he is capable of it. He has scored so many goals already at a relatively young age. So, he's capable of it. So I'm confident and 100% believe he can do the same as two years ago.”",
      "United have signed frontman Joshua Zirkzee in an attempt to further improve their attacking options. He isn't part of their pre-season in LA because players who made the semi-finals of the Euros were given more time off after the tournament. Zirzkee is likely to report to Carrington the week before the Community Shield against on August 10.",

      "The upshot was that United's session began later than planned, which meant Ten Hag's press conference for Saturday's friendly with Arsenal was pushed back by half-an-hour.",
      "But the Dutchman was adamant his players should reward the fans for their loyalty and patience, by signing as many autographs as possible and posing for pictures.",
      "United midfield star Kobbie Mainoo is enjoying a well-earned extended break following his exploits for England at Euro 2024, where he became an automatic starter for Gareth Southgte's side.",
      "Mainoo flew to Los Angeles for part of his break, posting pictures of his holiday on his official Instagram account, but has so far not met up with his United team-mates.",
      "United's new signing, Joshua Zirkzee, is also in LA on holiday, after representing Holland at the Euros, but has also not met up with his new team-mates yet.",

      "On Friday, Erik ten Hag and his newly-assembled coaching staff put the 29-man squad through a demanding double session, both of them taking part in front of hundreds of United fans, including Manchester-born Lord of the Rings star Dominic Monaghan.",
      "While Ten Hag and his coaching staff put the squad through their paces in 28C heat in training on Friday, four players – Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans, new signing Leny Yoro and third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton – sat out the afternoon session, with the understanding their omission was down to managing their individual workloads, rather than any significant fitness or injury issues.",

      "The Dutchman faced an uncertain future after his second campaign ended following the Red Devils' lowest ever Premier League finish. Victory in the FA Cup final arguably saved him amid suggestions he could be about to receive his marching orders.",
      "Ten Hag remained defiant - claiming he would go and win elsewhere if the club didn't want him - before he ended up staying. The Dutchman pointed to United's lack of success prior to his arrival and maintained that he needs the players and those above him to be aligned if they want to challenge consistently for honours.",
      "He said: “We are now in a new season, we left everything behind and we are looking forward. It's a great project, the process is nice, we go with ups and downs, but now we are very energised, good dynamic, good spirit, looking forward, we want to work and we want to win.",
      "“I never think if I'm in a strong position or weak position, but when you take over a dressing room that didn't win one trophy in six years, you have to prove [yourself]. But I don't think I am strong or weak. I want to collaborate and I can't do this on my own - players, staff, leadership, everyone - I'm sure we will have even more success.",
      "“We proved we can beat the best team [ Manchester City ] not only one time, but we did it twice. A lot of other games were very close to them, but our challenge is to be more consistent.”",
      "Ten Hag has been able to deliver trophies in both seasons he's been at the helm, but that has somewhat covered up cracks in their league and European campaigns. With INEOS now at the helm Sir Jim Ratcliffe has surrounded Ten Hag with quality operators, which should aid their ambitions.",
      "Some pointed to the lack of obvious candidates to replace Ten Hag as a reason behind United retaining him. Several of Europe's top clubs were looking for new managers with few getting their top choice.",
      "Sporting director Dan Ashworth said after United triggered Ten Hag's one-year extension: \"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently. With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.”",

      "United retain interest in Jarrad Branthwaite, but have refused to meet Everton's £70m valuation, with Bayern Munich's Matthijs De Ligt a more realistic target at £42m.",

The good thing is we already signed two players, but it belongs to a club like Manchester United that you are still looking - if the opportunity is there - for better and we still have time, until August 30.\"",

      "Many may not have noticed because it kicked off before the Olympic Games opening ceremony, but the football has already started in the French capital. Unlike the European Championship or Copa America, the football event is capped at Under-23 players, with only three 'over-age' exemptions being allowed for each nation.",
      "While many big names may not be involved, it provides a platform for talented youngsters or players who are not able to get into their national team. And there are plenty competing in the Games who could add immediate value to Ten Hag's squad.",
      "Mirror Football has a look at five Olympic stars the Red Devils could potentially target in the summer.",
      "If United are interested in the Rennes forward, they may have to fight off competition from Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Doue earned his place in the French squad by contributing four goals and six assists in 43 appearances for the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "Bayern Munich are understood to have already seen a £29m offer be turned down. Ten Hag's options on the wing are limited, particularly with Jadon Sancho's future still uncertain and Antony continuing to struggle.",

      "He is young, 6ft 4in and looks hungry to cause havoc - Samuel Omorodion could lead Ten Hag's line or be the ultimate Plan B. Ten Hag leant on Wout Weghorst over the course of his first season and the gangly Dutchman helped bring out the best in United's other forward options.",
      "Omorodion could play a similar role to Weghorst while also offering so much more. While on loan at Alaves from Atletico Madrid last season, the 20-year-old scored eight goals and contributed one assist in La Liga – an impressive return for a young forward.",
      "He has a big future ahead. And the Olympics could be his opportunity to make his name on a big stage.",
      "He is considered to be one of Villarreal's most promising academy prospects in years, Alex Baena is an exciting player to look out for. The Spaniard is a talented playmaker who contributed 14 assists for the La Liga giants last season - only Alejandro Grimaldo and Nico Williams contributed more in the top five leagues in Europe.",
      "If United are to lose Bruno Fernandes, as some reports have claimed is possible, Baena could be the perfect replacement for the Portuguese international. However, if they did hang on to their captain, Baena could potentially play in midfield with Fernandes.",
      "He can dictate play from deep positions or play across the forward line where he can also make late runs into the penalty area. But he will not come cheap as Villarreal reportedly value him at around £50m.",

      "United reportedly lodged a bid of around £25m for Fermin Lopez, who scored eight goals in 31 appearances for Barcelona last season. Lopez was also part of the Spain squad that won Euro 2024, but he only made one appearance from the bench in Luis de la Fuente's side 1-0 victory over Albania.",
      "However, the Olympics could be the perfect springboard for his career. Lopez is a versatile attacker who can play on the left, behind the striker or even within the midfield three. The 21-year-old has been at Barcelona since 2016, where he moved from the Real Betis youth development system into Barcelona's famed La Masia.",
      "But his future is uncertain amid Barcelona's pursuit of Nico Williams and their other links to Dani Olmo. With the club still struggling with their finances, they may be convinced to part with the young Spaniard as a means for raising funds. If Ten Hag rates Lopez, Barcelona's situation could play into United's hands.",
      "Of course, Achraf Hakimi cannot be considered as a young prospect, but he is exactly what United need. As the captain of Morocco's Olympic squad, Hakimi is one of the highest profile players at the Games.",
      "United struggled in the full-back areas last season as injuries and inconsistent performances from Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka meant they were missing sharpness at both ends of the pitch. With Wan-Bissaka's future currently uncertain as a result of interest from the likes of West Ham United and Inter Milan, Hakimi would be a perfect replacement.",
      "He brings experience, leadership qualities and pace at both ends of the pitch. Moreover, now could be the time for United to launch a bid, as he only has two years left on his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. As they have already watched Mbappe depart the club on a free transfer, the Parisians would not want the same to happen again. United are, however, interesred in other right-back options such as Bayern Munich's Noussair Mazraoui and Inter's Denzel Dumfries.",

He only just moved to the Portuguese capital from Lecce, penning a lengthy deal, which also included a release clause of €80million (£67.3m).",
      "There is no desire from Sporting to let Hjulmand leave on the cheap over the coming months. Portuguese news outlet Correio da Manha claimed that Sporting boss Ruben Amorim has a handful of players who he views as 'untouchable' and Hjulmand is one of them - thus why he will only lose him for a mammoth fee.",

      "The Red Devils are considering a swoop for the wing-back, who has long been linked with a switch to Old Trafford. Dumfries and Wan-Bissaka both have their deals running out in 12 months' time. United have been looking to get the former Crystal Palace man off their books with West Ham among those interested - but the player himself is not interested in a switch to London.",
      "If Ten Hag is to offload Wan-Bissaka then he'll have to take a huge financial hit, but a swap deal could yet suit both the Red Devils and Inter. According to The Athletic, intermediaries have proposed the potential deal and although talks are not at an advanced stage, interest remains.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite will hold off on signing a new contract with Everton unless they match the terms he agreed with the Manchester outfit - which would see him earn £160,000-a-week",
      "The highly-rated defender has been identified as a top summer transfer target by those in Manchester, although United have been unsuccessful in their pursuit thus far. They have seen two bids for Branthwaite rejected after falling to meet Everton's £70m valuation of the player but have agreed personal terms should they have a bid accepted.",
      "United have since signed Leny Yoro and will not overpay for Branthwaite, who will be offered a new contract by Everton, but much may depend on whether they can match the finances he would receive at Old Trafford.",

      "Erik ten Hag has challenged Marcus Rashford to prove he can rediscover the form that saw him plunder a career-best 30 goals.",
      "Rashford endured the worst season of his career last term, managing just eight goals, his loss of form seeing him miss out on a place in England's Euro 2024 squad.",
      "It was a far cry from the season before, Ten Hag's first in charge, when Rashford, 26, scored 30 goals in all competitions, earning a lucrative new contract worth £300,000-a-week.",
      "But on the eve of the first game of United's US tour against Arsenal in Los Angeles, Ten Hag backed Rashford to get back to his best form and show last season was a one-off.",
      "“Rashford can only improve himself,” said Ten Hag. “He is capable, he has scored so many goals, and at a relatively young age, so he is capable of it.",
      "“I'm confident and have 100 percent belief he can do the same as he did two years ago.”",
      "United slumped to their worst Premier League finish last season, ending in eighth spot, but ended the campaign on a high, by beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup and claim a Europa League place.",
      "Despite that win, Ten Hag was left in limbo for two-and-a-half weeks by the United hierarchy, who considered potential replacements, before deciding to stick with the 54-year-old Dutchman.",
      "Reflecting on that period of uncertainty, Ten Hag said: “We are now in a new season, we left everything behind and we are looking forward.",
      "“It's a great project, the process is nice, we go with ups and downs, but now we are very energised, good dynamic, good spirit, looking forward, we want to work and we want to win.",
      "“I never think if I'm in a strong position or weak position, but when you take over a dressing room that didn't win one trophy in six years, you have to prove [yourself].",
      "“But I don't think I am strong or weak. I want to collaborate and I can't do this on my own - players, staff, leadership, everyone - I'm sure we will have even more success.",
      "“We proved we can beat the best team [Manchester City] not only one time, but we did it twice. A lot of other games were very close to them, but our challenge is to be more consistent.”",
      "United have added striker Joshua Zirkzee and defender Leny Yoro to the squad, but Ten Hag said he needs more signings this summer to bolster the depth of his squad.",
      "“We already have two very good buys, so when everyone is fit we have a team who can beat anyone,” said Ten Hag.",
      "“But the squad depth means we have to catch up, because we had injuries last season, we are vulnerable and we have to avoid this by getting fewer injuries.",
      "“Secondly, our squad has to be that good. The quality in terms of what we have in depth, we have to catch up on that, but even more because this season will be the survival of the fittest.”",
      "“We are looking to reinforce in all of the positions and we are looking for a plan in our squad to reassure ourselves that we are always occupied [in terms of cover].”",

      "Erik ten Hag's side have seen two bids turned down for Jarrod Branthwaite by Everton. The Toffees have been steadfast in their belief that the England international should command a fee in the region of £70m.",
      "United have also been credited with a move for Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt but an agreement is yet to be made between the European giants.",
      "Bayern would likely suffer a significant loss on the Dutchman they signed for £68m in 2022. It is said a deal worth £42m could be enough to persuade the Bundesliga runners-up and the club's honorary president, Uli Hoeness has admitted a defender could leave.",
      "\"It's possible that a defender will leave,\" the Bayern chief told Sky Germany. \"I would have no problem if [De Ligt] stays.\" Hoeness, however, then expressed his desire for De Ligt's team-mate, Dayot Upamecano, to stay. \"Personally, I would not sell Upamecano.\"",
      "It appears United could have found another option for a similar fee in Silva. The 20-year-old defender has a release clause of £84m but reports in Portugal suggest he could be available for half as much.",
      "That has left United optimistic over negotiating a deal, even though a bid is yet to be forthcoming for Silva. It will leave the club with a decision over where to spend a modest transfer budget that will be boosted by player sales.",
      "Speaking about a possible move during the season, Silva appeared unflustered. \"I don't know how next season will be, but my focus at the moment, is on Benfica,\" he said.",
      "\"I am under contract [until 2027] and I trust my dad a lot, he has his say in most things and I also believe in my agent, they're the ones that take care of my life. And I just want to be focussed on Benfica. I feel very valued here at the club and what will happen, will happen.\"",

      "Sofyan Ambrabat is another man who could move to Manchester having spent the season there on loan at Old Trafford last term, but it is far more likely that he'll head back to Fiorentina.",
      "United's Hjulmand pursuit is also hampered by their lack of funds in what is INEOS's first summer at the helm. Ten Hag has a limited budget having already spent more than £40m to land frontman Joshua Zirkzee and defender Leny Yoro from Lille.",
      "If the Red Devils are to land the Dane, who scored the long range equaliser for his country against England at this summer's Euros, they may have to move players on, namely Casemiro. The Brazilian occupies a midfield berth but endured a poor season with his hefty wages a problem.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has established himself as a starter in the middle of the pitch but beyond that plenty of spaces are up for grabs. Scott McTominay was another man to enjoy plenty of midfield minutes but he - like many of the squad - could be moved on if the right money is offered.",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has spoken out on the speculation over Erik ten Hag's future at the end of last season and claims it affected players' performances",
      "Harry Maguire claimed the uncertainty surrounding Erik ten Hag's position conspired to sabotage Manchester United's chances of success last season.",
      "Despite leading United to FA Cup success over local rivals Manchester City, Ten Hag was left in limbo for two-and-a-half weeks over the summer, before being given the green light to carry on.",
      "Maguire admitted it was strange celebrating United's FA Cup triumph with the players and staff on the night of their Wembley win, not knowing if any of them would see Ten Hag again.",
      "But Maguire reckons all the speculation surrounding Ten Hag's future affected the form of the players, with United ending the season in eighth place, their worst-ever Premier League finish. “It was tough,” said Maguire, speaking at United's Los Angeles hotel on their US tour. “I felt some of the things that came out in the lead up to the FA Cup final were really poor.",
      "“The manager handled it brilliantly. For us players, we didn’t see anything different in the manager, so credit to him for the way he handled it, because there was so much uncertainty around the club.",
      "“Especially for the staff, the manager and all of the other staff as well around the club, they didn’t know what was happening the following year. It was tough.",
      "“It probably did damage our performances and results throughout the season, especially when it happened around that Christmas period when we really did fall off.”",
      "Reflecting on the surreal atmosphere at United's party to toast their FA Cup win, Maguire said: “It was so strange. No-one really knew what was going on, no-one had any assurances. But I think it’s the same for players. It happens every summer - there are so many players linked with the club and so many linked with going away, you just don’t know.",
      "“If you'd asked the players, they'd probably have said they didn’t really know, because no-one really had a clue.",
      "“But credit to the manager for taking the team out with a victory against probably the best team in Europe at the moment.",
      "“He could have downed tools and maybe just thought his time was over, but he definitely didn’t do that.”",
      "Maguire, 31, showed his strength of character last summer, after having the captaincy taken off him by Ten Hag, by emerging as United's most reliable centre-back last season, stepping up when others were ruled out, until his own campaign was cut short by injury.",
      "“I'm really proud,” said Maguire. “I always had great belief in myself. In my fourth year, under Erik, I didn't play as much as I would have liked, so I knew I had to bide my time.",
      "“I spoke with the manager last year about my situation, whether to move on and get regular football and regular game time, but he fully believed in me. He said there will always be chances. I backed myself to get back into his plans and was really pleased with the way I handled last year. My form was really good in every game I played.",
      "“The only other part of it was that it was frustrating how many little injuries I did pick up throughout the season which really stopped me from playing 30 to 40 games, instead of the 20-odd I did.”",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Despite only having one year left on his contract, with the option for an extra year, Maguire wants to stay at United and play his part in trying to make the team successful again.",
      "“Until I get told 'you're up for sale' or 'we want you to leave', I want to play for this club and make it successful again.",
      "“All the things I’m hearing and seeing, from everyone involved, is that I’ll be part of this club for the future.",
      "“I’m a player with only a year left on my contract, with an option, but if they come to me and say they don’t want me any more, of course I’ll look for options elsewhere, but that’s never been told to me.”",

      "Maguire suffered a calf injury which ruled him out of Manchester United's 2-1 FA Cup victory over local rivals Manchester City, then endured another setback which saw him miss the Euros.",
      "Reflecting on his disappointing summer, United and England defender Maguire said: “It was probably the toughest moment of my career. I worked so hard throughout the year, to get myself in a position where I was in a really good position physically and mentally, to play the FA Cup final and then think about the Euros.",
      "“To have an injury which was, to be honest, not a big injury – it was just a calf injury, but it was only a three-week injury, but I had three setbacks with it.",
      "“When I first did the injury, I thought I'd be fit for the FA Cup final. So I pushed myself for the final, then I had a setback in the week leading up to the final, which ruled me out of it. At that time, it was no problem, I was going to be fit for the Euros. Then I went away with England and had another setback, so yeah, it was so frustrating,",
      "“When I look back, I wish I'd no chance with all of them, so I could have got my head around it. But it just didn't happen and maybe I just pushed myself to get back too early.\"",
      "Maguire said he was able to put his personal disappointment to one side and cheer on his England team-mates, watching them reach the final and go agonisingly close to winning the tournament.",
      "“I managed to get over it and was still in contact with a lot of the lads,” said Maguire. “Obviously a lot of them are my really good close mates and even though it was tough that I wasn't over there, they did make me feel like I was still part of the group.",
      "“It was tough to not be there but I still managed to watch the boys play and had big groups with my family and friends, who are all big England fans, so I still enjoyed the summer, watching them do well.”",
      "Meanwhile, Maguire believes his club side are now on the right path to success under Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe has assembled a new football leadership team, comprising CEO Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director.",
      "Maguire revealed Ratcliffe, who currently owns a 27.7 per cent share in United, has spoken to the players about his plan to take the club back to the top under the new regime.",
      "“It's exciting times for everyone involved with the club and it's definitely going in the right direction again,” said Maguire. “As a player and someone who cares about the club, it's really good to see.”",
      "On Ratcliffe, Maguire said: “He’s really interactive with the players and that's important. It's really good just to see them with the lads. The structure now, I really think it's going to work. There's more energy coming into this pre-season and more excitement. Last season was difficult, with so much uncertainty with every member of staff and even players.",
      "“It's definitely a more energised club to be involved in now. I do believe the structure they have got it will get back to where it should be.”",

      "United hosted a football match for social media influencers at UCLA yesterday, in partnership with their kit sponsor adidas. Steve Bartlett, of Dragons Den fame, was flown to Los Angeles by United, to take part in the commercial event, which was also attended by several first-team players and staff.",
      "The event was a cause for celebration, with United boasting record sales for their new navy away kit, which was launched just 24 hours earlier.",
      "One of the benefits of United staying away from the glare of Beverly Hills, in the SLS Hotel on the outskirts of the famous shopping mecca of Los Angeles, is the relative anonymity it affords its players and staff.",
      "There were no fans waiting outside United's hotel yesterday, an unthinkable prospect in the Far East or if they were staying in a more salubrious location.",
      "But that did not stop one eagle-eyed fan spotting former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, now a member of Erik ten Hag's coaching staff, spotting him walking with goalkeeping coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar and asking the Old Trafford legend for a selfie.",
      "Unlike most folk who fly from the UK to the west coast of America, United winger Jadon Sancho is clearly not afflicted by jet lag. Within half-an-hour of boarding United's chartered flight from Manchester to Los Angeles, Sancho was fast asleep, allegedly snoring, only waking when the plane touched down in California.",
      "Given that prolonged sleep, Sancho's team-mates assumed the 24-year-old, back at United after making his peace with boss Erik ten Hag, would have been wide awake on arrival in LA and struggling to get some shut-eye once they arrived at the team hotel.",
      "But Sancho then told his colleagues he had managed to sleep for eight hours on arrival at the hotel, meaning he was surely the most well-rested of Ten Hag's squad ahead of their first training session.",

      "The Red Devils have already added two new faces this summer and are considering a swoop for the wing-back, who has long been linked with a switch to Old Trafford. Dumfries and Wan-Bissaka both have their deals running out in 12 months' time.",
      "United have been looking to get the former Crystal Palace man off their books with West Ham among those interested. If Erik ten Hag is to offload Wan-Bissaka then he'll have to take a huge financial hit, but a swap deal could yet suit both the Red Devils and Inter.",
      "According to The Athletic, intermediaries have proposed the potential deal, although talks are not at an advanced stage. Dumfries' Dutch connection with Ten Hag has been a factor in the proposed switch.",
      "Dumfries though is coming off a disappointing season, where he started only 19 times in Serie A as manager Simone Inzaghi made his disappointment clear with the former PSV star.",
      "He said: “Dumfries did very well last year until December, then he had a problem and the last few months were not up to his standards, but at the European Championships we saw the usual Dumfries.”",
      "One man who has previously had good things to say about is Rio Ferdinand. The ex-United defender has already been influential in getting Leny Yoro to make the move from Lille to Manchester - rejecting Real Madrid in the process - and would likely approve of landing Dumfries.",
      "He said about the Dutchman: \"They're the outlet that get beyond, and he's a player you look at and think that he's athletic, can beat people one-on-one. It's not just about being there, it's the quality. He's not putting balls in willy-nilly, he's picking people out, those cutbacks have been ever so dangerous. He doesn't mind working at the other end of the pitch, as well. He's been a breath of fresh air for them and a very important player.\"",
      "United have something of an issue down the flanks defensively. On the left Tyrell Malacia has been sidelined for months whilst Luke Shaw only returned from his injury issues at the Euros. Wan-Bissaka's future remains unclear with Diogo Dalot now the first choice right-back.",

      "The 28-year-old right back for Inter Milan has found himself on Erik Ten Hag's radar this summer, as the Red Devils look to bolster their side following a dismal eighth-place Premier League finish in the 2023/24 campaign. And a deal could see Aaron Wan-Bissaka leave Old Trafford after a five-year stint in exchange so they acquire Dumfries, according to reports.",
      "The 26-year-old, who appeared 22 times in the Premier League for United last season has turned down a move to West Ham, but he could walk on a free next summer with his contract expiring. While the likes of Jeremie Frimpong and Vanderson have been reportedly explored by United, they are said to have their sights set on Dumfries at present.",
      "But the attacking full-back caused controversy at Euro 2024 over the summer, sparking a debate between pundits Wright and Neville. England captain Harry Kane was awarded a penalty in the 18th minute of the Three Lions' semi-final with the Netherlands, going to ground as a shot sailed over the bar.",
      "Dumfries caught Kane on his foot as he connected with the ball, but a penalty wasn't initially awarded after referee Felix Zwayer saw nothing in the clash. But after referring to the pitchside monitor to review the incident, Dumfries was penalised and a penalty was awarded to Gareth Southgate's side largely thanks to VAR's intervention.",
      "And while England fans worldwide were elated by the decision - with the side trailing 1-0 at the time thanks to a wonder strike from Xavi Simons - pundits covering the game were less than impressed with the referee's final decision. Neville dubbed it a \"disgraceful decision\", adding: \"There's no way that was a penalty.",
      "\"He just goes in naturally to block the shot. It's not a penalty for me. You have to take your luck though.\" But Wright disagreed, explaining that Dumfries' challenge was \"reckless\" before explaining: \"When you look at the way penalties are given now and the way the game is when we go to VAR, that was reckless.\"",
      "Former United skipper Neville argued: \"Reckless? That is not reckless. Oh my God,\" before Wright insisted: \"But Gary, he's given it. That's why we've got VAR. If that was anywhere else on the pitch you'd get a foul for it!\" Meanwhile, ITV commentator Lee Dixon agreed with Neville's stance.",
      "He added: \"I would be astonished if this was given. I’m pleased, don’t get me wrong. But from a defender's point of view, you have to challenge for the ball. They both go in for the ball. It’s a split second. I don’t think that’s a penalty, but I don’t care. I really don’t care.\"",
      "United have also been eyeing up Noussair Mazraoui as a replacement for Wan-Bissaka, given the full-back's uncertain future with Bayern Munich, as well as his experience under Ten Hag at Ajax. West Ham were favourites to sign the 26-year-old after reaching an agreement with Bayern and the player, but reports in Germany on Friday now suggest they have pulled out of the race over agent issues.",

      "The highly-rated defender, 22, was identified as a top summer transfer target by the top brass at Old Trafford and United moved swiftly to try and strike a deal with the Toffees.",
      "Unfortunately for United, they have seen two bids for Branthwaite rejected after falling to meet Everton's £70million valuation of the player.",

Other names linked with United include Adrien Rabiot, who is now a free agent, and Martin Zubimendi of Real Sociedad, while it's claimed United could seek to re-sign Sofyan Amrabat for a more modest fee after declining to trigger the £21.5m option they held to sign the loanee permanently.",

      "Yoro, a £52m signing, does not appear to have had long to wait to find a new home. Greenwood's Cheshire pad will cost him around £14,000 per month in rent, according to The Sun, but it comes well-equipped with amenities.",
      "The youngster can afford it, too. It's understood he will pocket a six-figure weekly wage at Old Trafford, worth around £144,000-a-week.",
      "The property, in the suburb of Bowdon, includes six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also has a cinema room and bar, with a gym in the garage.",

      "Yoro has already linked up with his new team-mates, and made his United debut within a week of signing. He played 45 minutes in a pre-season friendly against Rangers, with Amad and Joe Hugill on target as United won 2-0.",
      "Yoro was a regular for Lille last season despite only turning 18 in November. He is aiming to follow in the footsteps of some other big-money centre-back signings at Old Trafford, and revealed one of those players - former England defender Rio Ferdinand - helped convince him to make the move.",
      "\"It was like two weeks ago [when I first spoke to Rio],\" Yoro told club media. \"He called me. First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man Utd, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. It was really an honour to speak with him.",
      "\"He spoke to me about the club, and that this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. For me, it was really good to speak about this.\"",
      "Yoro and his United team-mates have three friendlies on the horizon, the first of which sees them take on Arsenal in California on Saturday. After their US tour, they will return to the UK for the Community Shield against Manchester City before beginning their Premier League campaign against Fulham on August 16.",

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has changed his shirt number from 11 to 9 for the upcoming season after previous holder Anthony Martial left Old Trafford",
      "Rasmus Hojlund will hope the number nine shirt can serve him well at Manchester United going forward, though not every holder of the iconic number has been successful.",
      "Hojlund wore 11 for United in his first season at Old Trafford after joining for £72million from Atalanta. He will now make the switch, though, after Anthony Martial's exit left the shirt vacant.",
      "The Danish international scored 16 goals in 43 appearances during his debut season in Manchester while wearing the number 11. It was an underwhelming campaign for the club, though, with an early Champions League exit and eighth-place league finish, though victory in the FA Cup final ensured it ended on a high.",
      "There had been suggestions new signing Joshua Zirkzee might become United's new number nine. Instead, though, that honour falls to Hojlund with Zirkzee expected to wear the same number 11 he donned for Bologna last term.",
      "Hojlund has a chance to make the new number his own, but others have tried and failed to assert themselves in the past. Here, Mirror Football looks at the previous wearers of United's number nine and how they got on.",
      "When the Premier League introduced squad numbers for the 1993-94 season McClair was the first to wear nine for United. The Scottish forward had already been at Old Trafford for the best part of a decade, winning the inaugural Premier League the previous season, and wore the number for three years before ceding it to Andy Cole.",
      "How would you rank Manchester United's number nines? Let us know in the comments section",
      "One of McClair's most notable moments in the number nine shirt came at Wembley in the 1994 FA Cup final. He came off the bench to score United's fourth goal in their victory over Chelsea as they wrapped up their first domestic double under Alex Ferguson.",
      "Cole joined United from Newcastle in a big-money move midway through the 1994-95 season, but wore 17 to begin with. He only switched to 9 for the 1997-98 campaign, when United lost out on the league title to Arsenal but the following season went rather better.",
      "The England international bagged 24 goals in all competitions in 1998-99, including a title-winning strike against Spurs on the final day of the league season. He netted just once in the knockout rounds of the Champions League, but it was an important one, sealing a comeback victory over Juventus in the semi-finals before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ended up as the match-winner in the final.",
      "The number nine shirt was vacant for the 2002--03 season after Cole's departure, but Louis Saha took it midway through the following campaign after joining from Fulham. Injuries impacted the Frenchman's time at Old Trafford, though there were still some high points.",
      "Saha contributed during United's 2006-07 and 2007-08 title wins under Ferguson, and scored several times during the run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2007. However, he played no part in the 2008 final as United beat Chelsea on penalties in Moscow.",
      "Just days after Saha's departure for Everton in August 2008, Berbatov made a deadline day move to Old Trafford from Tottenham. The Bulgarian was a natural fit to inherit the number nine shirt, and his spell brought highs and lows.",
      "The clear highlight came in the 2010-11 season, when 20 goals - including a memorable hat-trick against Liverpool - ensured Berbatov top-scored in the Premier League. By the time he left in 2012, though, his star had fallen.",
      "United went without a number nine in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge, and in David Moyes' sole campaign. Things changed under Louis van Gaal, though, with Falcao taking the shirt after joining on a season-long loan from Monaco.",
      "It was a forgettable season for the Colombian, who couldn't get into much of a rhythm as he made his return following serious injury. He was similarly underwhelming while wearing nine for Chelsea in the following season, but a return to Monaco brought a return to form in 2016-17.",
      "Martial made a flying start to life at Old Trafford after joining from Monaco in 2015. The number nine shirt appeared to suit him well as he curled home a memorable goal against Liverpool on his debut.",
      "He scored 11 in the league that season, and a career-best 17 in 2019-20 after reclaiming the number nine shirt. More recently, though, injuries have stood in the way of anything more.",
      "Martial's spell without the shirt began in 2016-17 when Zlatan Ibrahimovic took the honours. The Swede wasn't at Old Trafford for very long, but he did make an impact.",
      "United won the EFL Cup and Europa League in his one season in the shirt, with Ibrahimovic scoring twice in the final of the former. After leaving and then agreeing new terms, though, he inherited Wayne Rooney's number 10 shirt in his second season at Old Trafford.",
      "Ibrahimovic's switch to 10 came after Lukaku, a big-money arrival from Everton, became United's new number nine. Like Martial, he looked a natural fit on his Premier League debut - in his case a 4-0 victory over West Ham.",
      "After a fast start, though, his form tailed off and he left for Inter Milan in 2019. Not before a memorable outing against Paris Saint-Germain, though, when he scored twice in a dramatic Champions League comeback.",

      "A new report from The Mail, though, has outlined that Branthwaite will not accept such a proposal - unless the Toffees are willing to match the £160,000-a-week wages which were on offer at Old Trafford.",

      "But with Maguire in the final year of his contract, Yorke wants United to be ruthless and cash in on their former captain. He told BoyleSports: \"Harry Maguire could sit out the last year of his contract and know he's going to play at some point due to injuries, but United really need to be ruthless and get rid of him.",
      "\"They have Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Leny Yoro, but Harry Maguire is in the position that he doesn't have to go anywhere if he doesn't want to. The opportunity has passed to get rid of him because he so desperately wanted to be at Euro 2024 and he would have done anything to play. That was the time to move him so he could get regular football. So that opportunity passed and he's still there.\"",

      "Meanwhile, United are prioritising a deal for Manuel Ugarte. The Uruguay midfielder has been in talks with United over a possible move with Paris Saint-Germain likely to sell for the right price. A midfield capture would mean United have landed a signing in each main target area this summer.",
      "However, a move for a left-back could be on the agenda with long-term fitness concerns over Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The latter has been left back in England, with it indicating that a replacement could be sought, with the Dutchman still yet to play in more than a year.",

      "He told the Telegraph:",
      "“I’ve really enjoyed the sessions, they are different,” Heaton said. “He works more on cognitive basic calls, where it’s making you think quite a bit. On my first warm-up day, for example, he and I went out for half an hour and the focus was on doing a lot of opposites.",
      "“There would be a blue cone and a yellow cone and it was a case of doing the opposite of what he asked – so if he shouted blue, you have to go to yellow and so on.",
      "“Then he passed me the ball and if he said right, I’d have to go left. The progression [of the drill] would be the first instruction wouldn’t be an opposite but the second one would be an opposite. I was like ‘What?’ but it’s good. It does make you think so you’re not just going through the motions.”",
      "Sky Sports also says that Ivan Toney is expected to stay at Brentford after new Bees signing Igor Thiago suffered injury.",

      "As bizarre as it might initially sound, not signing Jarrad Branthwaite might be what Manchester United need this summer. This is exactly the kind of negotiation Ineos must use to prove that they are changing narratives at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United have appointed Norwegian Andreas Georgson as a first team coach.",

I never think if I'm in a stong or weak position. I want to collaborate and work together. I can't do this alone. I'm sure when we have the right vision, which we have, we will have even more success.",
      "When asked in the press conference about new signings, Ten Hag responded:",
      "I want the squad as strong as possible. We already made two very good buys so when everyone is fit we have a team that can beat everyone. But with squad depth we need to catch up because we had injuries. This season will be survival of the fittest.",

      "However, Shaw and Dalot remain on international duty while Malacia is not part of the United squad that has travelled for the pre-season tour of the United States. As a result, United are seemingly in the market for a new full-back this summer with Mazraoui a rumoured target.",

      "Man United take on Arsenal in their first pre-season tour match in Los Angeles and here are five things to look out for.",
      "As strong as possible?",
      "United can field a competitive XI against Arsenal even without their latter stage European Championship and Copa America participants.",
      "Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Marcus Rashford and Antony are yet to figure in pre-season but Maguire confirmed he is due to play at the SoFi Stadium. Rashford is the obvious left-sided winger to start ahead of Jadon Sancho.",
      "Manager Erik ten Hag could name an XI of Onana, Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Yoro, Murray, Casemiro, McTominay, Mount, Amad, Rashford and Hojlund.",
      "Amad's opportunity?",
      "Amad came on against Arsenal in New Jersey last July and lasted 14 minutes before he sustained a serious knee injury. One year and one day on, he would be the fans' favourite to start against the same side in Los Angeles.",
      "The 22-year-old was dynamic against Rangers in Edinburgh last week and the three games in the United States are an opportunity to ensure he starts against Manchester City in the Community Shield in two weeks' time. In Amad and new signing Leny Yoro, United could have two possible new first-teamers in their line-up.",
      "Hojlund at the tip of the arrow?",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has been a better substitute than starter since he returned from injury in mid-March. He started in all four of Denmark's matches at the European Championship and was blunt, yet he is a natural choice to inherit the number nine at United.",
      "United invested £72million to sign Hojlund and 16 goals was a decent return in his first season but he has to break the 20 barrier in his second.",
      "Midfield issues?",
      "Arsenal will have Thomas Partey and Martin Odegaard to pit against United's midfield. Ten Hag is not lacking options, with four of his five central midfielders available, yet it would be remiss if United were to enter the competitive campaign with that department largely unchanged.",
      "Casemiro and Christian Eriksen are only 32 but both looked older last season, Scott McTominay is an asset further afield and Ten Hag will have to fathom where best to maximise Mason Mount. Sofyan Amrabat, outstanding in the FA Cup final, might be missed.",
      "Murray's chance",
      "It is some leap for Sam Murray, technically on loan at National League Rochdale as recently as April, to now be a certain starter for United. The 19-year-old is the most senior left back on tour and he acquitted himself respectably against Rosenborg and Trondheim last week.",
      "Ten Hag could use the Arsenal match to increase players' playing time after affording them a maximum of 45 minutes in Trondheim and Edinburgh last week. For Murray, it is an opportunity to reassert himself after he was unable to be named on the bench in the second half of last season due to his work experience loan.",

      "Man Utd are set to appoint a coach to deal with set-pieces and Andreas Georgson will benefit from the experience he had in the role with Arsenal.",
      "Maybe it was inevitable that with the king of marginal gains playing such a prominent role at Manchester United now, Ineos would look to add a set-piece coach to Erik ten Hag's backroom staff.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford left no stone unturned in the bid for improvements at British Cycling and adding in a specialist coach to deal with a key area of the game is hardly revolutionary when placed alongside some of his ideas on the road, but it is another sign of United looking to move forward under the Ineos regime.",
      "Andreas Georgson is set to join the club as the man tasked with improving set-pieces, both in terms of creative attacking moves and becoming meaner defensively. Anyone who has watched United regularly in recent years would agree there is room for improvement in both areas.",
      "It was initially Eric Ramsey who oversaw set-pieces, but this was only alongside his other remit as a first-team coach. Georgson is set to focus entirely on dead-ball situations having built a reputation in this area of the game.",
      "The 42-year-old Swede will leave a management position at Lillestrom to take up a job offer at Old Trafford and it's clear to see that technical director Jason Wilcox has played a big role in the move. Wilcox was behind the appointment of Georgson as set-piece coach at Southampton a year ago and his comments then offer an indication of the style of play he is likely to prioritise at United, alongside Ten Hag.",
      "“Andreas has an excellent understanding of the game model we’re building here, in which set-pieces play an important role,\" he said.",
      "“He is an expert in what he does and truly eats, sleeps and breathes set-pieces, adding another string to our bow within the backroom staff supporting Russell [Martin] and the team.\"",
      "Georgson's spell at St Mary's ended when he was offered the Lillestrom job in December but he is now set for a return to a focus on set-pieces, having held similar roles at Brentford and Arsenal. The Bees have developed a reputation as a forward-thinking club and Georgson found a group of players receptive to his detailed methods.",
      "But his recollections of working at Arsenal in the 2020/21 season are particularly interesting now he is set to join United. The clubs are of a similar size, with players used to more creative sessions than the repetitive nature of set-piece work, and it sounds like Georgson is aware of what he needs to change from his time with the Gunners.",
      "\"If I look back at the first couple of months (at Arsenal) I got it wrong,\" he told the Training Ground Guru podcast in 2022.",
      "\"That effected our quality on the attacking side (with set pieces). I came in with, I think, a too big level of detail in the set-piece process. In the beginning it was impossible for the player to take it all in.",
      "\"I came from Brentford. They had worked for many years very deep into set pieces and made it part of their identity. I think Arsenal at that point was more of a traditional club in terms of what level of focus set pieces got.",
      "\"I didn’t get it right in terms of how big and flexible to make the set piece process, so we struggled quite hard to be effective attacking wise, but became really strong defensively.",
      "\"The attacking process was too detailed, too flexible and too big, because that was the system I was used to from before. I realised that the players at Brentford were used to that, they had done that for many years, and they were not so stressed by the fact that my plan was quite detailed.\"",
      "Georgson ended up focusing on set-pieces in England after a fateful visit to Brentford's training ground while completing his UEFA Pro Licence at Malmo. He met Nicolas Jover while studying Brentford's processes and when Jover moved to Manchester City, Georgson replaced him. Jover is now in charge of set-pieces at Arsenal.",
      "When he starts work at United, either linking up with the club on their US tour or at Carrington, winning over the players will be vital.",
      "“It’s very, very hard,” Georgson told The Athletic in 2021. “If a player could choose, they would play five-a-side, with no instructions, at full-on power all the time. This type of training is quite far away from that.",
      "“You can try to make it fun — a match-like, live situation where you compete. But then sometimes you have to take it slow, because it might be a situation where the player needs a bit of calm, for their technique or to focus on details. Ultimately, the main thing is when they see results. That’s how simple the human brain is.\"",
      "If United score from one of Georgson's routines early in the season then it could help to convince the players that the time spent going through the process on the training ground is worth it. That was a stage he never quite got to at Arsenal, but he did improve them defensively.",
      "\"Hopefully I gave them some guidance and we did some detailed work that I think is not common in football - that you work details in marking, details in avoiding a block or doing your specific role,\" he told the Training Ground Guru.",
      "\"With the defensive side (of set pieces) we really managed to find a process that can go all over the season, so the players get reminded in a good frequency about the small details they should keep doing.",
      "\"I made sure the principle was as clear as possible. Then the key people in the process - some players in our hybrid defence - I actually fed back with them after every game. And on the pitch I took the stance that I do something after every session set piece wise.\"",

      "\"We are vulnerable and we have to avoid this by getting less injuries and second, our squad has to be that good. The quality we have in depth we have to catch up but even more because this season will be the survival of the fittest.\"",
      "Ten Hag confirmed United are open to reinforcing in every position amid uncertainty over the futures of several players. United want to sell right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, centre back Victor Lindelof and need to shift a midfielder to reinforce that area, with Manuel Ugarte of Paris Saint-Germain their favoured target.",
      "Tyrell Malacia's absence from the pre-season tour in the United States could also see United move for a left back. With Luke Shaw unavailable after his participation in the European Championship, academy players Sam Murray and Harry Amass are the only left backs on the United tour.",
      "\"We are looking in all of the positions to reinforce and we are looking for a plan in our squad to reassure ourselves we are always occupied,\" Ten Hag stressed.",
      "\"We are occupied (at centre back) but we work continually and the good thing is we already signed two players but I think it belongs to a club as Manchester United that you are always looking if the opportunity is better and we still have time until August 30.\"",
      "Ten Hag briefly touched upon Ineos's decision to keep him after a 17-day end of season review.",
      "\"We are now in new season, we left everything behind, we are looking forward, it's a great project, the process is nice, it will go with ups and downs and now we are very energised. A good dynamic, good spirit, looking forward, we want to work and we want to win.",
      "\"I never think if I'm in a strong position or a weak position. Probably you are right but when you take over the dressing room that didn't win in six years one trophy, then you have to prove yourself. But I don't think I am strong or I am weak.",
      "\"I want to collaborate, I want to work together, I can't do this alone. With the players, the staff, the leadership, everyone, and I'm sure with the right vision we will have even more success.\"",

      "Georgson will work alongside fellow first-team coaches Steve McClaren and Darren Fletcher in the refreshed set-up. It is the latest development in a busy summer after Ineos conducted an end of season review into the management and footballing situation at the club.",
      "That review ended in Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Dan Ashworth deciding to retain the services of Ten Hag, despite a season which saw United have their worst Premier League finish since the league's inception. United finished in eighth position, but still ended the season with silverware, lifting the FA Cup with a superb win over Man City.",
      "Ashworth, writing an open letter to fans earlier this week, said: “Omar Berrada has started as chief executive, and Jason Wilcox as technical director, and I can assure you that we have lost no time in getting to work. Our first big decision of the summer was to extend Erik ten Hag’s contract as men’s first-team manager to June 2026, reflecting our strong belief in him as one of Europe’s top coaches, and the partner we want to continue working with to get the team back to the levels expected.",
      "“We are all clear that last season fell below the required standards in the Premier League and Champions League but, by winning the FA Cup in such impressive fashion, our players and staff showed what they are capable of when everyone pulls together and performs to their potential.",
      "“Our collective challenge is to reach those levels much more consistently. It’s my job, together with Jason, to create the right support structures and environment around Erik, the staff and players to make that possible. Already, I can feel a strong sense of energy and determination around the group, as the players and staff return fresh from their breaks, including some exciting new additions to the squad, and to the coaching team.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag's side have already made two additions this summer, with the arrivals of Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee and starlet centre-back Leny Yoro set to prove mightily helpful in their bid to climb up the table after a torrid Premier League campaign last year. Their eighth-place finish almost put the Dutchman out of a job but his side's 2-1 win in the FA Cup final at Wembley over rivals Manchester City meant a new lease of life and with the arrival of new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, there's been a dramatic shift already at the club.",
      "Inconsistency in the defensive line last season mainly due to injuries has meant that upgrades were needed, and with Yoro already in the squad for the club's preseason tour of the US, attention has now turned to who will be joining him. The next man through the door could well be Mazraoui, and it is believed that, following talks with Man United over the last few days, he has stopped negotiations with West Ham over the past 24 hours.",
      "That means United are said to be in front with the reported initial fee of £13.5m plus £3m in add-ons from the Hammers' deal. The 26-year-old made 29 appearances in all competitions for Bayern last season but struggled with muscle fibre injuries on top of his participation with Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations. And whilst it was an underperforming campaign from their usual gold-star standards, Mazraoui isn't a slouch by any means.",
      "He has won four domestic titles - three in the Netherlands and one in Germany - and is a World Cup semi-finalist back in 2022, meaning he'd be a brilliant pickup for United at such a low price in today's market. On top of all of that, Bayern may be willing to part ways with him easily given that they already have a backup waiting in the wings.",
      "But using Macro Football’s player impact tool, which uses analytics to understand a player’s seasonal impact to see which players in European football's top five leagues are most similar to their characteristics, Bayern defender Josip Stanisic ranks in the top five most similar players.",
      "He has returned to Bayern after a successful loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen last season meaning they already have the replacement in-house. The 24-year-old's stellar season under Xabi Alonso's double-winning side has seen interest in him go through the roof, having broken through into the starting XI at his loan club midway through the season.",
      "Stanisic became a vital part of their title-winning campaign, even scoring against his parent club in a 3-0 win back in February before nodding in a key 97th-minute equaliser against Borussia Dortmund in late April to help Leverkusen secure their first ever domestic title.",
      "He also provided the 97th-minute winner against AS Roma in the Europa League semi-final, while having provided two assists against Roma in the first leg and West Ham in the quarter-finals. He ended with 10 goal contributions for the season, most of which came while playing on the right hand side of defence.",
      "Interestingly, the most similar player to Mazraoui according to his characteristics is Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol, who impressed in his first Premier League season under Pep Guardiola after a £77.6m move last summer. If Mazraoui can have a similar impact under Ten Hag, they'll have bagged a bargain.",

      "Having named a group including just 15 senior players (plus 18-year-old new signing Leny Yoro), the current options are still some way from that of which will be available come the opening day of the Premier League season in just three weeks. Still missing a core of first-team names, Ten Hag must make the most of his time in the States.",
      "After two initial friendlies with mixed results against Rosenborg and Rangers, United are out in America ahead of three matches preceding the Community Shield. They will first take on Arsenal in a significantly harder task than their previous challenges, before then facing Real Betis and Liverpool.",
      "As Ten Hag looks to experiment and build fitness but also shape his players ahead of the upcoming season, the time for handing out opportunities will pass quickly. As such, the game against Arsenal may well be the last chance for a handful to stake their claim in the first-team.",
      "Not only will the class of 2024 - United's Under-18 treble winners - have their best opening but so will some of the wider squad. If Victor Lindelof is to make a late U-turn and convince the club not to sign a second and maybe third centre-back this summer then he will not get a better (or perhaps even another) time to do it.",
      "Given Lisandro Martinez's absence having played a key role at the Copa America for Argentina, Lindelof's game time will be severely strained once the Arsenal fixture passes. The same, in a different sense, is also true for Will Fish and Rhys Bennett.",
      "The youthful duo still have plenty of time to get themselves into senior thinking but for this tour in particular, opportunities may not extend much beyond the next game or two. For left-back Harry Amass, one of the jewels of the current academy, there might be a bigger period for him to impress.",
      "Luke Shaw is still away but will need time to build up match sharpness following injury and weeks of waiting to be passed fit at the Euros. With Diogo Dalot not back in training either and Aaron Wan-Bissaka the only senior right-back, Amass might just find himself in consideration for longer. Fellow teenage full-back Sam Murray is in the same boat.",
      "Wan-Bissaka himself may not get much of a look in as United plan for the future. Although he is expected to have a bigger role than the juniors below him, the free spot ahead before Dalot and Shaw arrive in America is a key moment for him.",
      "In midfield, Casemiro has a narrative to change after last season while Scott McTominay is perennially linked with a move away from Old Trafford . For Toby Collyer, Hannibal, Jack Fletcher, Sam Mather, James Scanlon, and Maxi Oyedele it is more a case of making the most of the experience rather than cementing a place under Ten Hag.",
      "With United still looking for a new centre midfielder there is also pressure on Mason Mount to hit form heading into his second year at the club. Christian Eriksen, like Casemiro, will not be short-changed of minutes in pre-season but he does have a limited timeframe before Fernandes and Mainoo come back to take over.",
      "As for the attack, with Joshua Zirkzee another not yet in America, Ethan Wheatley's best chance to show his goalscoring prowess comes now. Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho will have a chance to shine before Alejandro Garnacho joins up. Antony is in a similar camp.",
      "But for some senior players - Lindelof, Wan-Bissaka, McTominay, Eriksen, and Sancho - their chance is now.",

      "As many as 278 wheelchair positions and 278 dedicated amenity seats are present across the stadium, including in the Stretford End. Banks, who was awarded his MBE in 2022 for his excellent work for MUDSA over several decades, is a lifelong United fan and has organised consecutive annual dinners since Sir Alex Ferguson attended the first one in 1998.",
      "Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the 73-year-old was keen to point to the progress that has been made at Old Trafford and hopes the same consideration for disabled fans will be given for any new stadium plans that come forth, be that a revamp or rebuild.",
      "“Do what you need to do according to the rules, but do it with a willing heart,” Banks said, as a message to Ratcliffe and United.",
      "“You don’t have to do just the minimum. If you can get a bit more in, get a bit more in. Where could we have steps, could we have a ramp, where could we have a lift?”",
      "Banks mooted several areas that would need consideration within any fresh development plans, including disabled parking, a possible sensory room and ensuring carers and partners have seating next to wheelchair spaces rather than behind them.",
      "He added: “Can we stop this terrible scenario of disabled people sitting by the edge of the pitch and getting absolutely soaking wet when it rains or are worried about the ball hitting them? I would certainly get rid of all pitch side positions.”",
      "When asked about MUDSA’s stance on being invited to planning meetings about any forthcoming changes to Old Trafford, Banks said: “It's not just a case of we would like to, we’d demand it.",
      "“I don't think we need to and I think they would do it. My experience with the club over the last eight years... I can't imagine that they would try to do something like this without consulting our 2,500 members. I think it's a big issue.",
      "“I couldn't imagine for a moment that they wouldn't want to consult with us, but if there's any doubt in the mind, I would make sure that they knew that they needed to.\"",
      "In a final line to Ratcliffe, Banks said: \"Don't forget about us. Include us in your planning.”",
      "Manchester United has insisted that all key stakeholders, including local residents and fans, will be consulted during the process. The club has said it has a strong relationship with MUDSA and it plans to speak to the fan group as part of development planning.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui is being monitored by Manchester United and his profile fits the bill for ten Hag and Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "When Noussair Mazraoui left the field for the final time as an Ajax player, there was a warm embrace on the sidelines from Erik ten Hag. The two could soon be sharing a welcome to Manchester hug.",
      "United are monitoring Mazraoui and the Morocco international’s decision to turn down a move to West Ham had further fuelled the prospect of another Ajax reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "Ten Hag has a penchant for signing players he’s worked with before or with experience in the Eredivisie and Mazraoui fits that bill. It's hard to call the United manager's success rate with such a strategy a success with Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount having plenty to prove even if Andre Onana and Lisandro Martinez have shown their value.",
      "But the 26-year-old Mazraoui is far more than an Ajax alumni. His time in Amsterdam spanned 17 years. As a youngster there were three rejection letters from the club before he was accepted into the prestigious academy. Even then this wasn’t a straightforward stroll into the first team, Mazraoui fought and grafted to make the grade and it was Ten Hag who gave him a senior chance with a debut in 2018.",
      "\"The first time they told me I was too lightweight,\" Mazraoui recalled of his early career. \"It hurt. I was a little boy, and cried. After my fourth try-out, I got an acceptance letter.\"",
      "“I was never the greatest talent,” he added. “I came into the pro ranks as an amateur...without a [professional] contract. You can’t say I didn’t have the potential. But it just hadn’t developed for a long time.”",
      "A clutch of appearances in 2017-18 preceded a change in position to right back and from there Mazraoui's career took off. His previous experience in midfield has helped shape him into a modern full back capable of carrying an attacking threat and with the defensive nous to also offer stability. He reads the game impressively and offers versatility, capable of playing on both sides of the defence as well as central midfield.",
      "A series of impressive displays for Ajax, both domestically and in the Championship League, along with a starring role in Morocco's World Cup run to the semi finals raised his stock. It’s why Bayern Munich came calling. And while his time in Germany hasn’t gone to plan, the player and the potential remain.",
      "With a £17million price tag and in the prime of his career he offers Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe what they want from a modern United deal while providing Ten Hag with a more dynamic and complete full back to Aaron Wan-Bissaka who ironically is now a target for the Mazraoui-less West Ham.",
      "Should the former Palace man depart, then United could strengthen sensibly and swiftly.",

      "Whether the Community Shield counts towards the trophy haul is up to fan discretion, but this year’s edition offers the chance for Manchester United to land an early blow to their cross-city rivals.",
      "The two clubs will have different aims next season, both domestically and in Europe, but a win at Wembley would act as a springboard into the new season. The United coach is expected to make more signings and perhaps a handful during the pre-season tour of the USA. Ten Hag would not get drawn into how many he is targeting but said he is aiming for a “squad as strong as possible”.",
      "That would denote at least a midfield recruit, probably a full-back and possibly another centre-back, with Leny Yoro already acquired. A right-back could also be sought after if Aaron Wan-Bissaka departs as is being rumoured.",
      "MEN Sport understands United are favouring a move for Manuel Ugarte over other midfield options with talks under way. The Uruguay pivot was an important part of his country’s third-place finish at the Copa America, starting every match.",
      "This comes after a season of being in and out of the Paris Saint-Germain team, having been acquired from Sporting Lisbon only last summer. He started the first five matches of the club’s Champions League campaign but failed to make up the line-up at all in the knockouts en route to the semi-finals.",
      "So United might be tentative about paying his apparent £40m asking price, with the club thought to be working on an overall net spend of just £50m this summer. But it seems Ineos has identified Ugarte as their most realistic quality target, with few clubs rivalling their interest.",
      "With Everton holding firm over Jarrad Branthwaite’s £70m asking price, United may have to look elsewhere. Personal terms with Matthijs de Ligt have been agreed for some time, ableit a sum with Bayern Munich is yet to be shaken on.",
      "There are inklings United are considering other options before making a concerted effort to reach a fee agreement for the Dutchman, while ten Hag's side are also having to balance finances carefully. It may well be that outgoings are needed before more arrivals.",
      "Around £95m has been splashed on Yoro and striker Joshua Zirkzee, with £36m acquired from the sales of Mason Greenwood, Alvaro Fernandez, Donny van de Beek and Willy Kambwala, although this figure could rise in time with add-ons. But a £40m splash would leave the club £101m in the red, hence the need to sell - and probably as soon as is possible.",
      "It is unlikely United go for both right-backs with Diogo Dalot performing well last season. Wan-Bissaka has been linked with a swap deal involving Inter defender Denzel Dumfries.",
      "This sounds more exciting than a move for Noussair Mazraoui but it would likely cost more too. Inter might want a bit extra for a deal involving Wan-Bissaka, which could make United lean towards Bayern Munich’s Mazraoui.",
      "United are thought to be in talks with the full-back, who played under Ten Hag at Ajax, after talks with West Ham broke down. A £16.5m package had been agreed with the Hammers before a move was called off, which is a price that United can now use against Bayern in a chase. That would likely be a figure lower than what Wan-Bissaka will go for, which will help the books.",
      "It would also create a more manageable scenario when it comes to game-time jostling with Dalot, with Dumfries expected to command regular minutes more adamantly. A decision could be made in the coming weeks.",

      "The youngster broke into Manchester United's first team in November and was given the chance to start alongside Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro's defensive discipline allowed Mainoo to go forward without fear of leaving his teammates exposed and he scored goals against Newport County, Wolves, Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester City. The latter was the winner in the FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "Mainoo's goal against City was the most important of his career but his strike in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Old Trafford was probably the best in terms of quality.",
      "Mainoo wasn't a prolific scorer during his time in the academy - he scored six goals in 56 appearances for the Under-18s and Under-21s - but his finishing improved last season and his excellent goals against Wolves and Liverpool are difficult to pick between.",
      "It's up for debate which goal was the best, but there is no debate about whether Mainoo should continue to start in the new campaign. He confirmed himself as one of Europe's most exciting prospects last term and is a guaranteed starter on the opening day against Fulham.",
      "Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are two of the first names on the team sheet, although the same can no longer be said of Casemiro, who succumbed to decline last season.",
      "Although Mainoo enjoys playing with Casemiro, the 32-year-old has entered the winter of his career and looked a shadow of his former self throughout 2023/24. Casemiro still allows Mainoo to get forward because he sits in front of the defence but his quality has diminished.",
      "Casemiro is not as effective as he used to be, which means Mainoo and Fernandes must do more, and that's why United are looking at midfielders in this summer transfer window.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new football structure understands the importance of signing a defensive midfielder and United are interested in Martin Zubimendi and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Zubimendi would be a shrewd addition from Real Sociedad and Ugarte would add to the contingent of South American players if he signed from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Both players would be an upgrade on the version of Casemiro that disappointed last season, but it would be a surprise if they could have the impact the Brazilian did in his first year.",
      "Casemiro was outstanding in his debut season in Manchester, helping United to win a trophy and qualify for the Champions League. He was in the conversation to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award and his replacement would, ideally, be of similar quality.",
      "While Zubimendi and Ugarte would be welcomed signings, it would be a surprise if either had the same influence that Casemiro had. The former Real Madrid star was still among the best in the world in his position when he signed, which is the standard United require.",
      "Neither Zubimendi nor Ugarte are considered among the best No.6s in the world - that's not to say they aren't quality players - and perhaps United will need to exercise patience.",
      "The budget is stretched this summer and without offloading Casemiro, United might have to negotiate a deal for a midfielder using similar terms as they did for Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "United stumped up a sizable loan fee to sign Amrabat and inserted an option to sign him permanently - that approach could be used again in talks for someone like Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte could be another short-term fix to a long-term problem. United need a world-class defensive midfielder but will have to be patient to sign that player.",
      "The market in that position isn't inspiring and Mainoo might have to wait for his dream partner.",

Either Sancho or Antony would, in theory, be the sixth and final option - unless they both end up leaving.",
      "In that scenario, there could be scope in the budget for another signing. Step forward, Ivan Toney, perhaps?",
      "Regularly linked with a move to Old Trafford - albeit before Zirzkee touched down - the England international has 12 months to run on his contract with Brentford, and this summer represents their final chance to get a reasonable fee for him. Arsenal and Chelsea are said to be among those on red alert.",
      "United do not need Toney, as such, but the opportunity to get one over two Premier League rivals might be too good for INEOS to refuse. A pursuit might be regarded as stockpiling, but the 28-year-old would offer some extra experience while helping Hojlund and Zirkzee hone their skillset.",
      "A signing for the present to help the future. At times last season, Ten Hag was left scratching his head as to who should be picked in attacking quarters and in which roles.",
      "Garnacho, Rashford, Hojlund, Amad, Zirkzee and Toney - with Sancho and Antony gone - might be as challenging for the Dutchman. However, funds dependent, it would be a much more welcome headache!",

      "Man United now have to get into the habit of not letting the manager solely decide players' futures. That forward planning has already started.",
      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Eric Ramsay left United earlier this year for the top job at Major League Soccer side Minnesota United",
      "Manchester United’s coaching revamp this summer has seen Old Trafford hero Ruud Van Nistelrooy return to familiar surroundings while Rene Hake has also joined - but it’s a name who left last season whose star might ultimately burn brightest.",
      "Eric Ramsay opted to depart United for the top job at Minnesota United in Major League Soccer and he’s made an immediate impact at a club that had plateaued during Adrian Heath’s seven year tenure. Ramsay is just the club’s second manager and while the Loons are only mid table as they chase a play off place, the new boss has impressed tactically and personally in his new surroundings.",
      "He was something of a surprise appointment and at 32 is the youngest coach in the league by a distance. But his CV is impressive. He cut his coaching teeth in the lower leagues before joining Chelsea and subsequently United in 2021.",
      "His role at Old Trafford grew from player development and set pieces under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to assistant first team coach with Ten Hag. His ability to speak Spanish and French helped him integrate players and he was well thought of at the club.",
      "But the lure of being number one with Minnesota proved to great a pull and Ramsay made the brave call to move across the Atlantic with his young family. Five months into his tenure we get the lowdown from Star Tribune journalist Jerry Zgoda on how Ramsay is faring.",
      "\"Pretty comfortably, considering he was hired late and arrived four matches into the regular season, after interim manager Cameron Knowles coached the team to a season-starting 2-0-1 record.",
      "It helped that he brought his wife and young children over not long after that. The team also hired a familiar face, Dennis Lawrence, from Coventry City as a first-team assistant who provides experience alongside Ramsay, who at age 32 is the youngest coach in Major League Soccer.",
      "Ramsay arrived late because new Chief Soccer Officer Khaled El-Ahmad was hired shortly after last season’s ended early last November but he didn’t start on the job until he finished his obligations at Barnsley in January. El-Ahmad previously considered hiring Ramsay for the Barnsley job and had him atop his list when he moved from Barnsley to Minnesota and MLS.\"",
      "\"Most supporters had never heard of him, but approved because he isn’t Adrian Heath, the former Everton star of the 1980s. Supporters questioned Heath’s substitutions – or lack thereof – and player-personnel moves when he took on both coaching the team and managing the roster. He was Minnesota’s only manager in seven seasons before he was fired last October because the team had plateaued.\"",
      "\"He’s smart, he speaks at least five languages in a global game and so far has been even as can be, win or lose. He certainly has an impressive CV for someone just 32 years old and in his first managing job. He seems to have what it takes to be successful long-term, but football is fickle.\"",
      "\"He was hired because his beliefs and philosophies coincide with the man who hired him, El-Ahmad: They agree and prefer to defend with a high line that wins possession of the ball, although Ramsay has shown the flexibility to change formations and styles of play to suit who’s available for his lineup and differing opponents.\"",
      "\"Good, when he’s had a healthy and full roster and despite the absence of the Loons’ best player, Argentina midfielder and MLS All Star Emanuel Reynoso.",
      "When he arrived and took over for interim Cam Knowles three games into the season, Ramsay soon managed the team to a 6-3-2 stretch with a six-match unbeaten streak included. At the time in April and throughout May, it had the Loons competing for first place in the MLS’s Western Conference.",
      "Then came injuries and the FIFA international window through which MLS continues to play matches. He managed a team that played with as many as nine players missing and Reynoso gone. Reynoso was transferred in May to Club Tijuana in Mexico’s Liga MX after he for the second consecutive season was absent and back home in Argentina for weeks and months at a time unexcused. The Loons also lost valuable defender/midfielder Kervin Arriaga in a transfer to Serbia club Partizan.\"",
      "\"The verdict is positive but inconclusive because of the season’s two disparate sections, one when had that full and healthy squad. The supporters are waiting to see just what he does when all of his players return from international duty and recover from injuries. He’s hopeful he and El-Ahmad can be productive in the July transfer window so they add talent lost in the transfer of Reynoso and Honduran defender Kervin Arriaga and rebalance a roster currently short on backline players.\"",
      "\"He certainly has been a change from Heath’s outgoing personality. He’s quiet, thoughtful and seems to be meticulously prepared. I think the players initially have respected his accomplishments, reaching first-team assistant status at a club as famed as Manchester United. And they like his even-keel demeanor. But ultimately, and always, it is about winning and the jury’s out until the season plays out through October.\"",

      "The right-back is being linked with Manchester United amid reports that Aaron Wan-Bissaka might be on his way out of Old Trafford.",
      "One of the toughest transfer market challenges Sir Jim Ratcliffe has to face is eradicating the ‘Manchester United tax’.",
      "Over the years, clubs have hoicked up the price tag for their player when dealing with the global behemoth that is United, whose worldwide acclaim guarantees them vast revenues of income. Where that money goes is a question many fans have asked, but some of it has indeed been spent on inflated transfer fees.",
      "Examples include £89m on Paul Pogba eight years ago and more recently £85m and £60m on Antony and Mason Mount respectively. United have too often agreed overpriced moves with the hope that it will work out. Ratcliffe has already shown he is on a mission to change this.",
      "Past transfer dealings mean United are thought to be working on a net spend of just £50m this summer, in light of Profit & Sustainability Rules. Ratcliffe refused to meet Everton’s £70m asking price for Jarrad Branthwaite and instead landed Leny Yoro - a European hot prospect - for an initial £52m.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was captured for £36m, just a year after United were charged double for Rasmus Hojlund. Of course, Hojlund is viewed to have a higher ceiling of potential, but there are only two years between the pair.",
      "Meanwhile, a classic example of United’s past transfer business is Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who has not fulfilled his £50m price tag. He has been a noble servant of five years but it seems the right-back is poised to move on this summer.",
      "Reports suggest he could be used as part of a swap deal with Inter for Denzel Dumfries. Meanwhile, Noussair Mazraoui has been linked with United, some might say unsurprisingly given he is a former Ajax player of Erik ten Hag.",
      "It is speculated that United are in talks with the Bayern Munich full-back, who is said to have cut off talks with West Ham over the past 24 hours. Mazraoui was acquired by the Bavarians for free in 2022, so any move would denote a profit.",
      "United will know this and will have also seen the figures widely circulated in relation to West Ham’s transfer interest in the Moroccan. It is said that a deal had agreed between Bayern and the Hammers worth an initial £13.5m with add-ons of a further £3m.",
      "Even if these figures are a couple of million off, United have their cap. A player is worth a certain value no matter which club they move to, Ratcliffe can argue.",
      "Bayern themselves might be spitting feathers that a deal had been agreed upon before Mazraoui backed out, thus revealing their hand. The German giants can’t even argue for a price increase due to United being a European rival, with the two clubs playing in different competitions next season.",
      "There is an overarching question over all of this, obviously - is Mazraoui worth bringing in? The 26-year-old started 24 matches last season and would have earned more but for two injuries and his participation in the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "He has won four domestic titles - three in the Netherlands and one in Germany - and is a World Cup semi-finalist. So for £16.5m, perhaps he is worth his salt.",
      "What’s more, it would help United’s coffers in light of spending limits and likely cost less than what Wan-Bissaka might get sold for.",
      "Mazraoui entering talks with West Ham, having a fee agreed, and then having second thoughts might have just helped Ratcliffe in his mission to cut out ‘The United Tax’.",

      "Diogo Dalot is a certainty to start at right-back and Lisandro Martinez and Shaw will also be among the first names on the team sheet. Martinez and Shaw spent large parts of last season on the sidelines and Ten Hag has reiterated how important they are for build-up play as left-footers.",
      "Although who starts alongside Martinez in central defence is up for debate, the early expectation is that Yoro will play against Fulham. The 18-year-old was signed in a deal worth €70m (£58.9m) and Ten Hag, speaking last weekend, said he was bought to play.",

      "Amad was the standout performer against Rangers last weekend and he could start on the right, with Hojlund leading the attack and Garnacho on the left. Dropping Rashford for Amad still feels some way off, though, and it would be another big decision from Ten Hag.",
      "Zirkzee scored 11 goals in Serie A last season and he's set to play a back-up role to Hojlund, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see him introduced from the bench against Fulham.",

      "Manchester United target Xavi Simons is eyeing up a move to the Premier League in 2025 as rumours continue to circulate over his future. The Red Devils have been linked with the 21-year-old this summer after impressing for RB Leipzig on loan last season and at Euro 2024 with Netherlands.",
      "It was reported earlier this month that United are plotting a loan deal for the talented winger, with Bayern Munich and Leipzig among his other possible options. Simons, who returned to Paris Saint-Germain last summer after the club activated a buyback £5million clause in his contract, has three years left on his contract.",
      "Simons scored 10 goals and added 15 assists in 43 appearances on loan at Leipzig last season and there is a concrete possibility he could return to the Bundesliga side this term. Despite re-signing him 12 months ago, it seems clear that Simons will not stay at PSG for the upcoming campaign, according to Le Parisien.",
      "Although he has been linked with a switch to England this summer, it's claimed that Simons is eager to move to the Premier League next summer - and that is his firm priority. A loan to Leipzig for the 2024/25 season and a switch to the top-flight of English football in 2025 appears to be his plan.",
      "Simons chose an English representative - the same one as Thierry Henry - a matter of months ago, making a move more likely. Speaking on his future last month. Simons said: \"My future? I don't know yet. I'm here, happy, with my selection. We'll see after the Euro what happens.",
      "\"Do I want to come back to Paris? I was happy in Paris, things happened. I was in Leipzig this season. After the Euro, we'll see. I also see that the supporters always wish me the best and that's good.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United boss Erik ten Hag praised Simons after he scored during Netherlands' Euro 2024 semi-final defeat against England earlier this month. \"I enjoyed Xavi Simons in that game (against England),\" he said. \"The drive he has, the passion with which he conquers balls and recognises situations are top.",
      "\"His enormous drive as well. That is almost un-Dutch. I think you can see that he was trained abroad. He almost has a southern European doggedness in his game.\"",

      "Rashford, 26, scraped only four goals last term and was disciplined twice by Ten Hag for off-pitch indiscretions, while friction developed between the academy graduate and the United matchgoers.",

But Rashford can only prove himself, he is capable of it, he scores so many goals and already at a relatively young age, so many goals, so he is capable of it.",
      "\"I am confident and have 100 per cent belief he can do the same as two years ago.\"",
      "Ten Hag also defended Mason Mount after his forgettable first season with United. Mount, 25, joined United for £55million rising to £60m last year but he played only 20 times in an injury-ravaged season and he has started once in the Premier League since October 7.",
      "\"You can't judge a season because he was injured,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"So don't judge him because he was injured.",
      "\"But when he is fit he will be a very good player for us and we can use his versatility. In a squad, you need certain types, you need leaders, you need team players, you need individual, and multi-functional players. He is one of the players. He can play in several positions and I'm sure he will help the team.\"",
      "Ten Hag was not as eloquent on Antony, scorer of a meagre three goals last season, and Jadon Sancho. Sancho has returned to the first team fold after he was banished last season but could still leave before the transfer window closes on August 30.",

      "Manchester United have been backed to complete more transfers this summer despite concerns regarding the Premier League's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.",
      "Last season, United watched on as some of their Premier League rivals found themselves struggling to meet the threshold for FFP. Both Everton and Nottingham Forest were handed points deductions for producing too big a loss, and the Reds were hesitant to make moves in January to ensure they were on the right side of the rules.",
      "United did not make any new signings in January, with Erik ten Hag admitting that even loan arrivals were out of the question thanks to how much they spent in the summer. When quizzed about FFP, Sir Jim Ratcliffe stressed he was cautious about the regulations imposed by the Premier League.",
      "\"We've got more accountants than we've got sporting people at Manchester United,\" Ratcliffe told Bloomberg. \"If you're not careful, the Premier League is going to finish up spending more time in court than it is thinking about what's good for the league.\"",
      "Having now entered a new FFP period, the Reds have dabbled in the transfer market again, bringing both Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro to the club. According to former Manchester City financial advisor Stefan Borson, United fans can expect more money to be spent this summer on one condition.",
      "\"United will have money to spend,\" he told Football Insider. \"That’s largely because I expect there will be quite a few sales this summer.",

      "Manchester United will play three friendlies in the United States after jetting out to Los Angeles on Wednesday, but their most important date of pre-season might be back at Wembley on Saturday, August 10.",
      "The Community Shield might come with silverware but it remains just a slightly more competitive pre-season fixture, even allowing for the fact that it will be yet another Manchester derby at Wembley. For Erik ten Hag, it will be the first time all summer he has his strongest squad available.",
      "There are plenty of star names on the flight out to the USA and the sides to face Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool will be competitive, but pre-seasons in years involving a summer tournament can be unpredictable and the success of some United players will give Ten Hag a dilemma.",
      "Of the six players set to miss the entirety of the tour, it is the two from Copa America winners Argentina and European Championship runners-up England that will be most critical. All of Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would be in Ten Hag's strongest XI.",
      "That isn't the case for Facundo Pellistri, a Copa America semi-finalist with Uruguay, or £36.5m forward Joshua Zirkzee, who reached the same stage of Euro 2024 with the Netherlands. Zirkzee is likely to begin the season as back-up to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Shaw's start in Berlin for the final against Spain is his only competitive start since February 18 and when he returns to Carrington he will have around a week to get up to speed for the Community Shield and just under two weeks before the Premier League campaign begins. United's lack of a left-back was a major problem all season and Ten Hag will hope his first-choice is ready to go this time.",
      "Martinez suffered his own injury issues last term but has come through the Copa America. He should be fit enough to try and build on that when he gets back to Carrington, but he will have a new central defensive partner, which for now looks like being Leny Yoro. They will hope to develop an understanding against Pep Guardiola's side on an afternoon when Martinez will try and top up his match fitness levels.",
      "As for the two youngsters, United will have to get their handling of Mainoo and Garnacho just right. The latter turned 20 midway through the Copa America but had a quiet tournament, playing just 65 minutes in one group stage appearance.",
      "Garnacho started every game for his club from November 1 onwards last season and his workload is something that will need to be monitored. It might be a challenge to get ready to start against Fulham after such a quiet summer.",
      "On the other hand, Mainoo forced his way into England's starting XI and enjoyed a good tournament. He has earned his rest after a breakthrough campaign last season. A year ago, he picked up an injury in the USA but recovered to become a key figure in the second half of the season.",
      "Ten Hag is likely to have Mainoo pencilled in to begin the season in midfield. That is an area of the pitch likely to undergo some transformation before the end of the transfer window, with a holding midfielder a target, especially if United can find a buyer for Casemiro.",
      "Bruno Fernandes looks likely to stay at the club despite the questions surrounding his future, while Mason Mount has enjoyed a good start to pre-season, but Mainoo was outstanding at times last season and is undoubtedly already a key player in this squad.",
      "That period between their post-tour return and the opening fixture of the competitive season will be key. United open the Premier League schedule on the Friday night and Ten Hag will want his strongest possible team available. That has been made more difficult due to the success some players have had this summer.",

      "As for Ten Hag, he will be pleased with the amount of change to his squad so far. It is only too obvious just how much still needs to happen in order for things to get to an ideal place ahead of the new league season.",
      "Here, MEN Sport looks at the latest rumours circulating for how United might go about doing just that.",
      "Around six weeks after being linked to Manchester United - in reports that were largely born of the Mauricio Pochettino speculation at the time - Trevoh Chalobah is a realistic target once again. It is claimed that after his surprise exclusion from the Chelsea pre-season tour squad, United could make a play to pick him up.",
      "The Blues are reportedly after between £25-£35million depending on which outlet you look at. Previously they have accepted £25million from Nottingham Forest but have also asked for £50million for both Conor Gallagher and Armando Broja.",
      "Chelsea are willing to sell Chalobah this summer as they look to cash in on him despite only tying him down to a fresh six-year contract (with an option to go to 2029) in 2022. Although he is allegedly feeling like the club are forcing him out, Chalobah is in no rush to leave unless an ideal destination is found. He would like to play Champions League football.",
      "MEN Sport says: This is going to be a bargain for someone, and with United being in the centre-back market, why not make it them? With Premier League and European experience, Chalobah offers plenty as a 25-year-old.",
      "At this price you really can't go wrong. He is able to play in defensive midfield and at right-back when needed and is just as good in the air as he is on the ground and spraying passes.",
      "Chalobah has pace to recover and is tactically astute having already operated under numerous managers in his career to date. Given the cost of some others on the market - and historically with Ben White costing £50million - this is a deal to be looked at.",
      "Given United could end up signing as many as three centre-halves, Chalobah as likely the cheapest option out of them would be a wise pickup. He is durable and would not directly impede the progress of Leny Yoro, but offer a great teammate to help him out and complement his abilities at the same time. It's a no-brainer.",
      "Despite Ten Hag signalling his intentions to welcome Jadon Sadon back into the fold this pre-season - indicated by the player being included in the USA tour squad - it is suggested that he could still leave this summer. According to ESPN, offers of £40million would still be considered for him.",
      "It is claimed that not only would United be happy to see him go, they have gone as far as offering him out to Paris Saint-Germain. French outlet L'Equipe add that he is close to agreeing personal terms with the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "United expect him to play a full part in their summer preparations though. Sancho has been training with his side but didn't feature against Rangers in the first friendly played. He did get minutes during the 1-0 win over Rangers last week.",
      "MEN Sport says: It would be poor practice for United not to keep their options open in the coming weeks. Even if Sancho is back in the fold it has been widely speculated that almost every player is available for sale anyway at the right price.",
      "Having that number in mind and being active in their recruitment is smart then. Sancho has the chance to prove himself before the season kicks off but if there are interested parties then learning where they stand only makes sense.",
      "Sancho is going to be up against it to get himself ample minutes as a regular starter, so having an alternative plan for things going south again is logical. For now there is a commitment to patching things up in pre-season but it would be foolish to not be at least aware of the other possible outcomes.",

One major hint as to where a player stands in the pecking order of the club comes when shirt numbers are announced.",
      "A high number in the squad (unless for a personal reason) is often an indicator that you are unlikely to be called upon as a regular first-team member next season. Of course, Kobbie Mainoo managed to buck that trend last season but those examples are few and far between.",
      "One man receiving an upgrade this summer is Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane wore the No.11 shirt last season but a tweet from the Reds' account on Wednesday afternoon suggested he was set for an upgrade with the numbers crossed out of 'RH11'.",
      "It transpired that Hojlund will now wear the No.9 shirt but what could be the reason for this? MEN Sport has taken a look at the three most likely scenarios.",
      "The most likely explanation is that Hojlund has merely received an upgrade as part of his growing stature in the squad. When he arrived from Atalanta, the No.9 shirt was held by Anthony Martial but since the Frenchman's departure that is now free.",
      "Hojlund is likely to be United's leading striker next season so it makes sense he would wear the No.9 albeit he has not worn it since representing Sturm Graz. At Atalanta he was No.17.",
      "Playing into the Hojlund upgrade theory is the fact United need to assign a number for new signing Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has not been synonymous with any number during his career but awarding him the No.9 in his debut season would have been a brave move.",
      "With No.11 now vacated it seems likely Zirkzee will be given that honour next season.",
      "If Zirkzee is not the one to take on the No.11, that will lead to big questions as to who will. From a marketing standpoint, it is unfathomable for United not to have a No.11 next season considering how important that number is to the history of the club.",
      "Should Zirkzee receive a different number, it could be the biggest hint yet that a new forward signing is on the horizon to fill that spot or that another player in the team is set for an upgrade. However, the issue with this latter theory is that there seems to be no standout candidate in the current team to inherit that shirt.",

      "The latest Man United transfer news after the club have already made two new signings this summer and are said to be already targeting a third, but seemingly must sell to buy",
      "Manchester United must wait to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka before recruiting a replacement right-back this summer transfer window.",
      "Wan-Bissaka, 26, is in the final 12 months of his contract after United activated an option to extend the deal by an additional year in early January. West Ham United are said to be targeting the defender during this transfer window.",
      "Diogo Dalot established himself as first-choice on the right of defence last season, with Wan-Bissaka falling out of favour with manager Erik ten Hag. The club have other options in the position under consideration but must seemingly recoup a significant transfer fee first.",
      "READ MORE:Man United get second chance to secure Erik ten Hag's dream transfer",
      "READ MORE:Seven transfers Manchester United could complete after selling seven players",
      "The Guardian reports United can receive around £15 million for the full-back they signed for £50 million five years ago. That income would go a long way toward financing a move for Noussair Mazraoui, who could come in for a reported £21 million.",
      "Ten Hag is said to be targeting the Morocco international, who made over 130 appearances for Ajax while the United boss was on the sideline in Amsterdam. The player's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, has already worked with United this summer during negotiations over signing his Bayern Munich teammate Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "However, what could complicate matters is that Sky Germany has reported that West Ham are negotiating with the German giants over Mazraoui. They also claim the player could be available for less than expected, £17 million, but no agreement has yet happened. Interest from United is acknowledged, but they reiterate that Wan-Bissaka would have to depart first.",
      "A loan also seems a no-go, with Mazraoui wanting a permanent move, while Bayern are only considering such a move if an obligation to buy is in any deal. West Ham seemingly have sights far from set on signing Wan-Bissaka, which may mean United must turn their attention to other options.",

      "The Manchester Evening News understands Rowe will play for United's Under-21s as a trialist in a friendly against Chester on Wednesday ahead of a potential appointment.",
      "Tom Huddlestone departed his hybrid role as player-coach this summer and Rowe, who has made over 600 professional appearances in his career during stints with the likes of Stockport County, Peterborough United, Wolves, Doncaster and Bristol City, could join in that position.",
      "United appointed Paul McShane in a pioneering player-coach academy position in the summer of 2021, which involved developing players and giving on-field instructions.",
      "The experiment was deemed a success by United and when McShane stepped back from playing and focused his attention on coaching, a replacement was needed.",
      "Huddlestone was his successor and he spent two years in the role before leaving at the end of last season. Rowe is the most recent candidate to be considered for the job.",
      "The 35-year-old's second stint with Doncaster ended last month. Rowe, who was born in Wythenshawe, came through United's academy and if the role progresses after his trial, he would help create unique development opportunities for players in the club's youth system.",
      "If Rowe is appointed, he will help academy players by coaching from within training sessions and helping to drive daily standards on and off the pitch at Carrington.",
      "Rowe would be available solely to play for United's U21s and other clubs have seen the merit of such roles, with Liverpool bringing back former player Jay Spearing into their academy.",
      "United initially raised eyebrows when McShane, who also came through the club's academy, was appointed in the hybrid role, but the position brings value to youth players.",
      "United U21s' game against Chester, which Rowe will be involved in, kicks off at 7.30pm on Wednesday.",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag will be forgiven for experimenting during the club's pre-season tour.",
      "Manchester United arrived in the United States on Wednesday without a flurry of big-name stars within their travelling party.",
      "As a result of both the European Championship and the Copa America taking place this summer, United's US-based supporters will not be treated to watching the likes of Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Those who represented their nations at either tournament are entitled to a period of three weeks off. Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund were the most recent members of the squad to return to Carrington, reporting back on Monday, after Denmark exited the European Championship on June 29.",
      "They were both included in the 29-man squad that flew from Manchester to Los Angeles earlier this week. Scott McTominay also travelled after Scotland's European Championship adventure ended at the first hurdle.",
      "There are several first-team regulars that have not travelled across the Atlantic, meaning the three starting line-ups Erik ten Hag fields during the tour are poised to be very different to the one he deploys for the Premier League opener against Fulham. You could argue that six expected starters against the Cottagers have not travelled to the US.",
      "On the flip side, their absences open a window of opportunity for those on the outskirts of the Dutchman's first-choice starting XI. Youngsters Harry Amass, Sam Murray, Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley will be among those wanting to catch the manager's eye.",
      "Wheatley has started each of United's opening two friendlies of the summer in the absence of a senior striker and he could retain his place against Arsenal at the SoFi Stadium this weekend. Hojlund has been back in training for only a few days and could be eased back into the fold via the bench, with a view to starting later in the tour.",
      "But even if Ten Hag springs a surprise and Hojlund gets the nod from the start against the Gunners, the United boss could still deploy a new-look attack. Ethan Williams and Marcus Rashford occupied the wide areas from the start against Rosenborg and Amad and Jadon Sancho started in Edinburgh against Rangers.",
      "Amad was United's best player against the Gers, causing plenty of problems on the right wing both before and after scoring the opening goal of the 2-0 win. Garnacho is his biggest rival in the race to start on that flank against Fulham, meaning the Ivorian needs to impress in his absence.",
      "However, pre-season is all about experimenting and taking risks managers wouldn't dare think about in competitive fixtures, meaning Ten Hag could experiment against Arsenal and deploy Amad in a central position as a No.10. He admitted after the win over Rangers the former Sunderland loanee has the capacity to play in that role.",
      "Asked if the right wing is Amad's best position, Ten Hag said: \"I think that's his best position, but he's capable of playing a lot of positions like the nine, the 10 or from the left wing. He can play all the offensive positions.\"",
      "Fernandes is United's chief attacking midfielder but the club is lacking a back-up option, with Mason Mount, by his own admission, more comfortable playing as a No.8. It is no question that Amad is at his best when playing on the right wing, but a pre-season friendly is the ideal opportunity to experiment and see what he can produce from a central area.",
      "If he plays in the No.10 role, he would be able to operate closely to United's two wingers and centre-forward. Antony will be hoping to make his first appearance of pre-season against Arsenal after playing no part in the opening two games and Rashford will be aiming to return after missing the clash with Rangers due to a minor knock.",
      "Even without Rashford, Zirkzee, Fernandes and Garnacho, Ten Hag still has Amad (£37m), Antony (£86m), Sancho (£73m) and Rasmus Hojlund (£72m) available. That's potentially a front four signed for £268m.",
      "Competition within the wide areas at Old Trafford is high, meaning it is natural somebody will be left disappointed in the season opener next month. Garnacho is likely to start on the right, meaning Amad will be restricted to starting on the bench.",
      "But if he can prove he can be just as impressive centrally as he has been out wide, he will give Ten Hag even more to think about. It's an experiment worth trying.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Man Utd youngster Ethan Wheatley has made brilliant progress in the academy and he made history with his senior debut.",
      "Manchester United created 'The Graduate Lounge' at Carrington last season. The space is a designated area for parents and families at the academy and it celebrates players from United's youth programme who have made a first-team debut.",
      "There is a buffet area, which serves free hot food and refreshments, and a terrific mural of academy greats, from Sir Bobby Charlton to Paul Scholes and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The names of every graduate can be found on the wall but a striking image of Ethan Wheatley with the number '250' has been framed behind glass, which draws the eye. The photo is a nod to Wheatley creating history last season and it's a classy touch in a well-thought-out space.",
      "Every player from the academy to make a senior bow at Old Trafford is celebrated, but Wheatley became the 250th player to achieve that when he was substituted onto the pitch in a 4-2 win against Sheffield United on April 24, which represented a significant milestone.",
      "\"It's a great club with a massive history, especially in the academy. It's an honour to make my debut and that number - 250. That's a little bit extra,\" said Wheatley on the night.",
      "\"I was just excited and when I got the call [to come on], there were a bit of nerves, but as soon as I was stripped and ready to go, I was excited and did my best for the team.\"",
      "To make a debut for United is a phenomenal achievement and players are influenced by parents, coaches, siblings and peers on their respective journeys to that breakthrough.",
      "Paul Strutt was Wheatley's first coach at Dukinfield Youth. He coached the youngster until he joined United's academy at age nine and has fond memories of that time.",
      "\"Ethan came to us at Dukinfield when he was six because we start our soccer school then,\" Strutt told the Manchester Evening News. \"There were regularly scouts from United, City and Everton watching at Curzon Ashton, which is where all the kids played back then.",
      "\"Because Ethan was fast, he was always your ‘get out of jail card’. He could go forward but we didn’t tend to pigeonhole kids with a position at that age, we’d just tend to see where they felt most comfortable, and Ethan was comfortable in the midfield and played there for us.",
      "\"But because he was that skilful, he basically had a free role where he’d just go and run. We had a couple of good defenders and he’d just pick up the ball and drive it forward.\"",
      "Wheatley was tremendous for United's Under-18s last season and was affectionately nicknamed '250' by his academy teammates after writing his name in the club's history books.",
      "There's also a brilliant story about how Wheatley, who has been described as an 'intelligent student', was back in school at Ashton on Mersey the day after his debut. He has now finished his formal education but won't need his BTEC in marketing if he continues to score goals.",
      "\"I know he was only on the pitch for 10 minutes for his debut, but you're just proud as a coach to see a kid you've helped to get started from the basics of football to eventually play for United, so hopefully he’ll be on the pitch for the first-team again this season,\" Strutt said.",
      "\"After winning what he did with the U18s, he deserves it. We've got nearly 300 kids at Duckinfield and if two or three can make it, that's what this is all about.",
      "\"It would be nice for Ethan to visit the club and when we have our next presentation, to come down and bring some mates, and say this is where he started, humble beginnings, and this is what you thrive to be and where you could go if you knuckle down and get on with it.\"",
      "Wheatley certainly 'got on with it' last season, scoring 12 goals in 16 league appearances between academy ages and playing a key role in the U18s claiming a treble. United won two of those trophies at the expense of rivals Manchester City and enjoyed a special campaign.",
      "Wheatley's brace against City was enough to win the PL Cup at Leigh Sports Village and he was substituted off at half-time so he could be involved against Sheffield United. Wayne Rooney watched from the stands at Leigh and would have been impressed with the goals.",
      "Erik ten Hag was behind the pre-organised change, as he needed Wheatley on the first-team bench less than 24 hours later but also understood he deserved to play in that final.",
      "Wheatley enjoyed a whirlwind two days, scoring the goals that won the trophy for the U18s and making his debut the next night. It was well deserved and he trained consistently with the first-team for the last three months of the season, which was another indicator of progress.",
      "It's understood Wheatley would have been at the FA Cup final at Wembley, but he was away with England's U18s and scored two goals on his debut for the Three Lions. Wheatley has no Malaysian heritage and is not eligible for Malaysia's national team, despite rumours.",
      "United's coaches felt Wheatley massively improved last season and really stepped up in quality, which made a debut possible, and staff were also happy with how he adapted to playing across multiple teams - U18s, Under-21s and first-team - and multiple different competitions. He has grown into his body after what a source described as 'diligent work in the gym' with strength and conditioning coaches, and Strutt saw him just a few weeks ago.",
      "\"Ethan has shot up in height now,\" Strutt said. \"I bumped into him recently at Hyde United, I was watching a game up there, and he was about 6ft 4ins because I’m 6ft and I was thinking bloody hell, Ethan, you’ve shot up! He was gangly and always skinny when he was a kid.",
      "\"When he first came to Dukinfield, he was quite a shy little kid. He had big afro hair, but the group of lads at the time, who we took through as a team, were together for a few years.",
      "\"Just like most kids, after two or three weeks, they start to feel welcome and start to come out themselves and Ethan did, to be fair. There were never any problems with him.",
      "Wheatley was a big United fan growing up and regularly attended Dukinfield training sessions wearing the club's kits. \"He was just a nice, lovely kid, always happy and wanting to play football, but he always wanted to a little bit more than everybody else,\" Strutt explained.",
      "\"I'll always remember this one goal he scored when we played in a final and he flicked the ball up with his right foot and hit it with his left. He was only about eight years old at the time.",
      "\"It went straight into the top corner. It was only a small pitch because they were young but I thought holy moly… where did that come from? The way he flicked it up and swung was amazing.",
      "\"He always had something about him. He had good parents as well, they made sure he got to the games, and he was just a good all-rounder, so his success is no surprise.\"",
      "Wheatley's talent and character have got him to where he is today, although his temperament was tested last season when he was involved in a shocking incident with a Liverpool teenager, who assaulted him by throwing a punch at his face during an U18 game at Carrington.",
      "A club source said Wheatley 'dealt with it really well', staying calm on the day and throughout the next week, and he had the last laugh when scoring against Liverpool in the reverse fixture, which led to him replicating Rooney's memorable boxing 'knockout' celebration.",
      "Wheatley has come out of his shell as he's matured and United's head of academy Nick Cox tells a story about him being a shy kid who didn't enjoy trips abroad when he was younger. So how did United keep happy when he was away from his family? They bribed him with pancakes.",
      "There are fewer pancakes for Wheatley these days, which is part and parcel of being a professional footballer (he signed his first pro deal when he celebrated his 17th birthday), and he's living a dedicated lifestyle to try to achieve his dream of starting for his boyhood club each week.",
      "However, there's still a score that needs to be settled, according to Strutt, as the internet has Wheatley as being down from Stockport when he's spent most of his life in Hyde.",
      "\"He’s actually from Gee Cross in Hyde,\" Strutt explained. \"He was born in Stockport and his dad played for Woodley, but when I speak to people about Ethan they get protective.",
      "\"When talking about him, they all shout ‘HE’S NOT FROM STOCKPORT, HE’S FROM HYDE!’. He’s been in Gee Cross most of his life and people from the area are proud you see.",
      "\"I’ve only closely followed his progress over the last two years or so and I got a few texts last season when he was first on the bench for United against Bournemouth.",
      "\"I thought wow when I heard that. I’ve been on his Instagram, watching his progress, and people would tell me things and send me photos. He was with all his mates when I saw him the other week, so it was just a quick hello, but it would be nice to sit down with him.",
      "\"I’ve got dozens of pictures of them playing for the Ducky teams, with his big curly hair and I actually sent him one of the photos. We've had a couple of lads to play for United, as Will Fish and Rhys Bennett played for Dukinfield, which is great. We do all right, I reckon.",
      "\"We all play a small part, they move on and fingers crossed they all achieve something. It's all down to Ethan now and I think he'll be around the first-team, but let's say he leaves United in a few years, he can have a great career and I'll always follow him and be proud of what he's done.",
      "\"Ethan has played for the team he supported as a schoolboy and I just wish him all the best really. He's just a lovely lad and deserves what he gets out of it in the future.\"",
      "Everyone connected with Wheatley are hoping his debut for United was just the beginning of his journey with the first-team and he was named the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year last season, an award won by the likes of Ryan Giggs, Scholes, Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Cox presented the award to Wheatley and said: \"Ethan really deserves this award, having represented the club to the highest standard across six different competitions this season. He has improved throughout the season, dedicating himself to his training programme, building on each performance and getting stronger through hard work and perseverance.",
      "\"He has made a great deal of progress, which was recognised last month when Ethan made his first-team debut and became the 250th academy graduate to play for United. Our U18s have had a fantastic season, so choosing just one player to win this award was really challenging.\"",
      "There's a feeling last season's U18s were as talented as the 2022 Youth Cup-winning team that included Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo - and Wheatley could soon become a permanent member of the senior squad if he follows in the footsteps of his slightly older peers.",
      "Last weekend, Wheatley started against Rangers in the second pre-season friendly of the summer in Scotland and was just denied an opening goal by a last-ditch goalline clearance.",
      "Wheatley was named in the travelling squad for the United States tour earlier this week and could get the opportunity to play in friendlies against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool. His family, friends, Strutt and everyone else involved with his journey will be closely watching if he does. United fans have a young striker to be excited about.",

      "Manchester United have made Jarrad Branthwaite one of their top defensive targets this summer with Erik ten Hag dreaming of three new centre-backs",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag spoke openly about new additions to his squad during his first press conference of the United States pre-season tour.",
      "When asked if he had a number in mind for the amount of new signings he wanted to add to his team, Ten Hag declined that theory and instead insisted he wants the strongest squad possible for the new campaign. Such a statement suggests that more incomings are wanted by the Dutchman before the new season starts in the middle of next month.",
      "In our latest look at the media headlines from elsewhere, there is a suggestion that United could be about to force Everton's hand with Jarrad Branthwaite. Take a look at that and the latest on Noussair Mazraoui below.",
      "According to reports, Branthwaite has rejected a new contract from Everton after bids for the centre-back from United were turned down earlier this summer. It is thought the Toffees wanted to tie the Englishman down to a better deal but their advances have not been given the green light by the 22-year-old yet.",
      "In an interview with talkSPORT, former Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce now believes Branthwaite holds all the power. \"You would be very, very flattered with clubs like Manchester United coming knocking. The power is with the player at this moment in time,\" he said.",
      "MEN Sport says: While United probably knew deep down their bid for Branthwaite would not be accepted by Everton, if reports are to be believed those offers could still have the desired effect. Perhaps the Reds have managed to turn Branthwaite's head with their offers which could be why he is rejecting a new and improved deal on Merseyside. The centre-back still has three years on his deal at Goodison Park so Everton will not be too concerned but United will be hoping they have rocked the boat enough to help them get a cheaper deal for the defender in the future.",
      "According to Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna, Mazraoui has made a move to Old Trafford a priority this summer with a Ten Hag reunion thought to be a driving factor behind this desire. Juventus are also thought to be keen but the Bayern Munich defender is lured to the Reds.",
      "A move to West Ham now appears to be over considering United are keen on the defender.",
      "MEN Sport says: United could come off the victor in this transfer triangle if they play their cards right. It is widely agreed the Reds will need to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka before they can add another right-back to their team. With the Hammers not able to bring Mazraoui to the club, it makes sense for the Reds to offer them Wan-Bissaka to help fund their pursuit of the Moroccan. Unfortunately, the biggest stumbling block here could be whether United will be able to convince the Englishman to choose West Ham considering he reportedly has his heart set on a move to Inter instead.",

Personal terms for the Netherlands international, 24, have been verbally agreed by Ineos and key figures at Old Trafford.",
      "However, the German heavyweights have, so far, been unwilling to budge on their £42million asking price. A deal seems unlikely, at this stage, but Real's presence could speed up the race.",
      "Although United and Bayern are thought to be way apart when it comes to a valuation, the Bundesliga outfit are open to selling the ex-Ajax captain this summer. United consider the Dutchman and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite as two preferred targets to join French youngster Leny Yoro in a new-look defence for the coming season.",
      "Reports emerging from Spain - as per the Football 365 website - highlight interest from Spanish champions Real. Still coming in under the Bayern valuation, Real president Florentino Perez is said to be 'willing to offer £34million' to secure De Ligt's signature - seemingly more than United hope to pay for him.",
      "Elsewhere, reports from Team Talk indicate Ajax want to re-sign Christian Eriksen on loan this summer. United are open to letting the Denmark playmaker leave - preferably on a permanent transfer - but the Amsterdam outfit are thought to be keen on striking up a temporary agreement.",
      "United signed Eriksen on a free transfer from Brentford in 2022 as a stop-gap solution for their midfield. However, the 32-year-old - capped 134 times by his country - started just 12 games in the Premier League last season and his future has been subject to speculation over the last few months.",

      "Man Utd are looking to refresh in full-backs areas this summer and they could make a new addition at right-back.",
      "Manchester United are back in the race for Bayern Munich right-back Noussair Mazraoui after reports in Germany said his move to West Ham had fallen through.",
      "The Hammers had an offer of €16m (£13.5m), with a further €3.5m (£2.9m) in add-ons, for the Moroccan accepted by Bayern Munich but it has been reported that he couldn't agree personal terms over a move to the London Stadium. That could offer United a route to sign the right-back, who played under Erik ten Hag at Ajax and is of interest to the new football structure at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Mazraoui was born in the Netherlands and joined Ajax as a youngster, playing 137 times for the club under Ten Hag, but he has struggled to nail down a place in the Bayern team since his move and is expected to leave Munich this summer.",
      "United are monitoring full-backs during the window, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka the only senior option in the tour squad. Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw remain on holiday after Euro 2024 and Tyrell Malacia continues to undergo fitness work at Carrington, having missed all of last season with a knee injury.",
      "A deal for Mazraoui is likely to depend on a sale at right-back, with United prepared to listen to offers for Wan-Bissaka, who has just a year remaining on his contract, with the option to extend it by a further year.",
      "There has been Premier League interest in the 26-year-old this summer, with West Ham one of the clubs credited with looking at the possibility of signing Wan-Bissaka. If their deal for Mazraoui is off, they could reignite their interest in the United man.",
      "Any deal for Wan-Bissaka will give United the funds and the space in their squad to make a move for a right-back, with Mazraoui an option they have identified.",
      "They could also make a move for a left-back in this window, with concerns over the role Malacia will be able to play after two operations on his knee. Shaw is only expected to return to Carrington around a week before the Community Shield.",
      "But that transfer is likely to be a short-term deal, similar to the loan agreed with Tottenham for Sergio Reguilon last summer.",

      "Jarrad Branthwaite was the first player Man Utd made a bid for this summer but the centre-back is staying at Everton unless they drop their demands.",
      "As bizarre as it might initially sound, not signing Jarrad Branthwaite might be what Manchester United need this summer. This is exactly the kind of negotiation Ineos must use to prove that they are changing narratives at Old Trafford.",
      "United have had two bids rejected by Everton for the 22-year-old centre-back, the second of £45m plus a further £5m in add-ons. The Toffees continue to insist on a £70m asking price and United continue to insist that isn't happening.",
      "For now, this is a stand-off. United have signed 18-year-old Leny Yoro for £59m to plug the initial hole in their defence after Raphael Varane's departure and while they are still open to signing either Branthwaite or Matthijs de Ligt, the pressure has been removed for now.",
      "At Goodison Park, they are planning for this season with Branthwaite in their ranks. The stance remains that if nobody offers £70m then he won't be leaving the club and while there is a long time left in this window, the view at the moment is that it's Everton who must change their valuation if a deal is to get done.",
      "But then you can see why they are holding firm. We've been here before with United. They wouldn't pay £60m for Antony in the same window they paid £85m. They wouldn't pay more than £60m for Rasmus Hojlund then did a deal for £64m, rising to £72m, just days later. Leicester City extracted £80m in one instalment for Harry Maguire in 2019.",
      "This is a club that has developed a reputation as a soft touch in the transfer market, one that other clubs can ride roughshod over. Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar once said that he \"challenged\" United to go as far as they can for Antony, a challenge they enthusiastically accepted.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe knows this is something he has to change. He once called United the \"dumb money\" in football and speaking in February after his investment into the club had been confirmed, he identified recruitment and value for money as a top priority.",
      "\"I think recruitment in the modern game is critical,\" he said. \"Manchester United have clearly spent a lot of money but they haven't done as well as some other clubs. So when I was talking about being best in class in all aspects of football, recruitment is probably top of the list.\"",
      "The evidence of what Ratcliffe made of recruitment is clear in the total overhaul of the football structure at Old Trafford. Omar Berrada, Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell are now the key figures when it comes to transfers and spending on players at United.",
      "They have already shown a willingness to be aggressive, blowing Real Madrid out of the water for Yoro, a teenager considered a generational talent and yet still cheaper than the fee Everton want for Branthwaite.",
      "Now, they probably need an example they can use to show that they are no longer a club that can be fleeced in the market. Executives at the club talk of a 'United tax', but they've encouraged that description with their own reckless spending. It's easy to get a reputation but much harder to shed it.",
      "Playing hardball over Branthwaite might be just what the new structure at United needs. They know they can't fold and accept Everton's demands. They have to stand firm, insist they won't go to £70m and if it means not getting the player, then so be it.",
      "That will be a short-term blow to Ten Hag, but long-term it will help United save millions in the market by proving they now have a team in place that don't fit the description of \"dumb money\".",

      "Man Utd are still working on recruiting new signings this summer and two targets are particularly familiar to Erik ten Hag.",
      "When Bayern Munich decided they wanted to offload two former Ajax players, their first call would have been obvious. Under Erik ten Hag, Manchester United have made a habit of targeting footballers familiar to their Dutch manager.",
      "So it's no surprise right-back Noussair Mazraoui and centre-back Matthijs de Ligt have emerged as United targets this summer as they head towards the exit at the Allianz Arena. Both played under Ten Hag for Ajax and continue a strong theme of transfers at Old Trafford.",
      "Four of Ten Hag's signings had played under him previously, three of them at Ajax in Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez and Antony. Another five had played in the Eredivisie and some had links to SEG, the agency which represents Ten Hag.",
      "The manager is certainly aware of the criticism, insisting in an interview in the Netherlands with AD last week that it was pure coincidence so many of his targets could be linked back to him.",
      "“I know Matthijs well and I will not deny that. I wanted to sign him two years ago but at that time, he was already very far along to join Bayern Munich,\" he said. \"But, believe it or not, his name did not come from me in the process (of shortlisting targets).”",
      "The interest in Mazraoui has broken since that interview and the Moroccan is one of the right-backs being considered should United manage to offload Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Mazraoui has struggled to nail down a place in the Bayern team but played 137 times under Ten Hag at Ajax.",
      "De Ligt, 24, captained Ajax as a teenager and although he has since gone on to play for Juventus and Bayern Munich, the 70 games he played under Ten Hag remains the longest association he has had with a head coach. That tells a story about how and why De Ligt's career has stalled in the five years since he left Amsterdam. He has played for five managers in five years and all of them for between 31 and 42 games.",
      "That isn't conducive to the development of a player and after Juventus sold the centre-back at a loss after three years, Bayern are looking to do the same after two seasons. An asking price of around £42m is tempting for United when they factor in his relationship with Ten Hag.",
      "It would certainly look like a bargain if he fulfilled the potential he showed at Ajax, but the transfer strategy being pursued by Ineos so far isn't entirely removed from what came before. When Sir Jim Ratcliffe's £1.25bn deal went through in February, he spoke about the changes he wanted to make to the structure.",
      "\"What you need are the foundations to be in a good place for Manchester United to be successful, which means that, from our point of view anyway, you need the right organisational structure,\" he said.",
      "\"Which means not having a coach reporting to the chief executive, for instance, which is what they've got at the moment. You need the right organisation structure and that's not going to be too complicated.\"",
      "Ineos have that in place now. They have a new, football-focused chief executive in Omar Berrada and a sporting director (Dan Ashworth) reporting to Berrada. Under Ashworth sit technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "Vivell's appointment could yet become more permanent and he is tasked with recommending players to fit into the 'game model' that the first team will play. It could well be a coincidence that United are again showing an interest in players so familiar to the manager.",
      "The aim under this structure is for the squad to be unaffected by a change in head coach. If Ten Hag does leave, it should be a case of finding a replacement with a similar style happy to work with the squad he inherits. That is why it's dangerous to allow a manager to dictate a transfer strategy.",
      "Maybe United have moved on from those days, but the evidence of this window so far suggests Ten Hag is still having fairly significant input into recruitment plans.",

      "Jadon Sancho still faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford and Manchester United need to make a decision on the returning England forward.",
      "After being ousted by Erik ten Hag last season - due to his public spat with the Dutchman - the former Borussia Dortmund man is back in training with the squad.",
      "The 24-year-old held positive discussions with Ten Hag and a line has been drawn under their situation. However, while an initial U-turn has been made, Sancho could still leave the club before August 30, especially with Ineos planning to generate much-needed funds to continue their recruitment drive.",
      "United realistically have four options on the table: sell the player, loan him with an obligation to buy, keep him or use Sancho as a sweetener in any proposed swap deal that might come their way. Our team have given their views and discussed what might be the best way for Ineos, Sancho and Ten Hag to move forward.",
      "The fact Ten Hag did not speak about Sancho with a great deal of warmth after the 1-0 defeat to Rosenborg last week suggests their relationship might not be as rosy as United would have you believe. It is a positive they have agreed to draw a line under the whole saga, but it is still far from happy times.",
      "Sancho undermined Ten Hag with his actions last September and no player should be allowed to do that. Furthermore, the winger has failed to flourish under any manager at United, suggesting it is unlikely he will make up for lost time this coming season.",
      "United need to raise funds through player sales and are currently knee-deep in wide players, meaning it would make plenty of sense for United to cash-in. A permanent sale would see the club make a huge financial loss, but it would still be a lot better than nothing.",
      "It is in everyone's best interests for United and Sancho to go their separate ways.",
      "The fact that the disagreement between Sancho and Erik ten Hag has been solved is good news for United and potentially gives the winger a chance to turn his career at Old Trafford around. But I still feel that United should cash-in - but only if the right offer comes along.",
      "There’s no shortage of suitors which should hopefully drive the price up. But anything less than a £30million offer should be dismissed, and a loan deal with an obligation to buy may also be a deal that could happen.",
      "There’s no doubt that Sancho has the quality to benefit United, but he has not shown it enough at the club. Maybe a second chance will give him the opportunity to do so, but it’s not like United are desperate for wingers for the upcoming season.",
      "If they are able to raise as much as £40m through a sale, then that could be spent on other areas that need more attention. United are more in need of a midfielder than they are wide men, so it may be a case of sacrificing one to bring in what they really need.",
      "Jadon Sancho and United should just part ways this summer. He has nothing to prove at Old Trafford. The winger demonstrated that he can perform at the highest level during his brief loan spell at Dortmund last season, helping the German outfit reach the Champions League final.",
      "While Sancho and Ten Hag have put their differences to one side, the duo have already proven that they're not compatible. I just fear that the Dutchman has papered over the cracks in their relationship.",
      "That being said, the Reds shouldn't put any cash from the 24-year-old's potential sale towards a bid for Manuel Ugarte. Chelsea dodged a bullet by not signing the Uruguayan midfielder last summer because there are far better ball-playing options on the market.",
      "Ten Hag was right to draw a line under the Sancho debacle at the beginning of pre-season as it threatened to unravel the positivity that had been built up this month in the transfer window. In an ideal world, Ten Hag would still be hoping the winger could be offloaded for £40m this summer.",
      "While a truce has been called between the two parties, it still feels as though too much water has gone under the bridge for a full turnaround to be secured. That money would go a long way to adding more strength to areas of the pitch that lack options.",
      "Wingers are fairly well-stocked in this squad so United would be in no great rush to find a replacement for Sancho. Instead, the money could be used to attract someone like Martin Zubimendi who would prove to be a wiser acquisition than Ugarte, in my opinion.",
      "Keeping his powder dry, Ten Hag claimed Sancho could have a future at Old Trafford when he was pressed on his discussion with the returning forward. A good player Sancho might be, but there is one major drawback in handing the ex-Manchester City starlet a second chance.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford both prefer to operate from the left side (though the former has been excellent on the right) and, while Sancho was signed to address concerns on the opposite flank, he too fares better when cutting in on his favoured right foot. Boasting three such first-team options is not healthy for squad balance.",
      "United would be better served cashing in on Sancho - so long as they can get a suitable fee - and putting money back into their transfer kitty. Ten Hag needs another defender, and midfielder, a whole lot more than he requires a back-up, right-footed left winger.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain star Ugarte is one of the midfielders United are looking at and if a suitable cash offer for Sancho doesn't arrive then the need for a defensive midfielder means United could do a lot worse than look to negotiate a swap deal with Ugarte replacing Sancho at Old Trafford.",

The former midfielder wanted to take Zubimendi to the Camp Nou during his stint as head coach and spoke glowingly about his credentials in May last year.",
      "Waxing lyrical about the Sociedad star, Xavi, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo, said: \"I like all of Real Sociedad. They mirror a bit our style of play.",
      "\"Zubimendi is an extraordinary defensive midfielder, he understands the model we like at Barca, he dominates with and without the ball.\"",
      "Few are qualified more than Xavi to make a judgement on a midfield player. The now-44-year-old is one of the greatest to have ever played the game and his honours list is stacked with silverware.",
      "Having described Zubimendi as an \"extraordinary defensive midfielder,\" it is easy to understand why United are keen on luring him to Old Trafford. The only stumbling block for the Reds, however, could be Sociedad's asking price, with his release clause reportedly worth north of £50million.",
      "Nevertheless, United know they need to find a world-class successor for Casemiro to compliment the qualities of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in the engine room. A player of Zubimendi's profile could be just the ticket.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip as former United goalkeeper David De Gea looks set to complete a move to a new club",
      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is reportedly closing in on signing for a new club.",
      "De Gea has been a free agent since leaving United in the summer of 2023. The goalkeeper spent 12 years at Old Trafford and amassed 545 appearances for the club whilst winning five major trophies including a Premier League title.",
      "United opted to sign Andre Onana from Inter Milan last summer as De Gea left the club on a free transfer when his contract expired. Since then, there has been intense speculation about which club De Gea could make his return to professional football.",
      "Now a report from The Athletic has explained why the wait may be about to come to a conclusion. The article claims that De Gea's next club could be announced as early as next week, with the new campaign due to start in the coming weeks.",
      "It has not been stated which club De Gea is seemingly set to join as he closes in on the next step of his career. The last competitive fixture the 33-year-old played was United's defeat to Manchester City in the 2023 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium.",
      "Last week, De Gea provided the first hint that a move to a new club may be on the cards. The former United shot-stopper posted an hourglass emoji on X, formerly known as Twitter, hinting that an announcement could be made.",
      "The United legend has been heavily linked with signing for a new club over the last 12 months and has been keeping himself busy since leaving Old Trafford. De Gea has been training at Altrincham's Moss Rose Stadium as well as Spanish football's headquarters, and now it seems the next step of the goalkeeper's career is moving ever closer.",

      "Ennis' previous deal with United expired in June 2025 and the Manchester Evening News understands he has signed fresh terms to extend his stay beyond next summer.",
      "The 19-year-old played the second half of the opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg, testing their goalkeeper with a powerful shot, and was introduced at half-time again last weekend against Rangers. Ennis is also set to be included in the United squad for the USA tour.",
      "Ennis began his career with Liverpool, but he was signed by United in the summer of 2021 and was the standout signing for the academy in an otherwise quiet window.",
      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "However, disaster struck in August 2022 when it was confirmed he'd ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. Ennis faced a long road to recovery after that injury and made his first appearance after a 14-month lay-off for the Under-21s against Fulham at the end of October.",
      "There were high hopes for Ennis when United signed him from rivals Liverpool and his minutes were carefully handled last season, which helped him return to full fitness.",

      "The Manchester Evening News understands United are hopeful of completing a deal for Obi-Martin, who would be given a scholarship with an agreement to sign a professional contract, if he decides to join the club and turn down interest from Bayern Munich and Newcastle.",

      "Man Utd have a wonderful record of developing young players and some academy talents will play on the tour of the USA.",
      "For any youngster at Manchester United, the opportunity to travel on a pre-season summer tour and rub shoulders with senior players is an unforgettable experience.",
      "United have travelled overseas during pre-season since Sir Alex Ferguson's reign - aside from when Covid restrictions didn't allow it - and the Reds have received incredible support everywhere they have travelled.",
      "There have been trips to nearby Scotland and Ireland, and longer haul journies to Scandinavia, Asia and North America. Arranging pre-season fixtures around the world gives United's global following an opportunity to see the team in the flesh but they are also commercially lucrative.",
      "The Premier League's elite sides have made regular trips to the United States in recent years and United will visit Los Angeles, San Diego and Columbia this summer.",
      "Erik ten Hag oversaw United's pre-season preparation in the States last year and named a 31-man travelling squad, which included Kobbie Mainoo, Omari Forson and Dan Gore.",
      "Mainoo became a first-team star in the following season. Gore was given his senior debut in September and Forson was handed his senior bow in January, which showed that the youngsters included on the USA tour in 2023 were highly regarded by Ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The crop of youngsters selected for the first-team squad for an overseas tour is usually a strong indicator of the manager's plans and it will be fascinating to see which academy players make the cut this summer.",
      "United have been at the forefront of youth development for decades and they continue to produce talent. Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo are the most recent success stories from the youth set-up and it's understood academy staff are confident more senior debuts will follow.",
      "The milestone of the 250th player from United's academy to make a first-team debut was reached last season and that was a magnificent achievement worth celebrating.",
      "Ethan Wheatley's name was written into the club's history books when he became the 250th graduate thanks to his cameo from the bench against Sheffield United in April. The young striker replaced Rasmus Hojlund in that game and savoured every minute on the pitch.",
      "After the match, Wheatley spoke to MUTV and he had to fight the smile on his face while he answered questions. \"It's a great club with a massive history, especially in the academy. It's an honour to make my debut and that number - 250. That's a little bit extra,\" he said.",
      "\"I was just excited and when I got the call [to come on], there were a bit of nerves, but as soon as I was stripped and ready to go I was excited and did my best for the team.\"",
      "Wheatley was given the nickname '250' by his teammates in the academy and his debut capped a whirlwind 24 hours, in which he also fired the Under-18s to a trophy.",
      "On the day before Wheatley's senior debut at Old Trafford, he scored a first-half brace for the U18s in a cup final against rivals Manchester City at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Wheatley was substituted at half-time so he could be involved with the first team the next day. Wayne Rooney was in attendance at Leigh and the United legend would have enjoyed what he saw, as Wheatley's goals were smartly taken and they were enough to win the trophy.",
      "There is more to come from Wheatley, who has already looked sharp in pre-season, and he's got an excellent chance of being included in the touring squad of the USA.",
      "The same can be said about Toby Collyer. The midfielder had the privilege of wearing the captain's armband in the second half of the opening pre-season clash against Rosenborg and there have been a few clues along his journey that suggest he's well regarded by Ten Hag.",
      "Collyer was named on the bench eight times last season and although he didn't make the squad for the FA Cup final, he travelled to Wembley and was on the pitch at the final whistle.",
      "Once the initial celebrations died down, Ten Hag was spotted in deep conversation with Collyer and he had a similar moment with Mainoo after the Carabao Cup final in 2023.",
      "Whether Collyer can have the impact in the first team Mainoo did remains to be seen - the Stockport-born youngster is an exceptional prospect and was superb for England at Euro 2024 - but it seemed significant that Ten Hag took extra time to speak to him.",
      "There was a further clue when Collyer was rewarded with a new deal in July that extended his stay until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his contract signing.",
      "A club source said Ten Hag 'really likes' Collyer, who is yet to make his senior debut, and it's highly likely he will be included in the pre-season travelling squad.",
      "United lost their opening friendly against Rosenorg 1-0 and Ten Hag was scathing with criticism after the game, but he couldn't be disappointed with the performance of Radek Vitek.",
      "Vitek travelled to America last summer and could fly across the pond again, despite United having Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Altay Bayindir in their goalkeeping ranks.",
      "The 20-year-old stands at a towering 6ft 6ins and he made an outstanding impression against Rosenborg, making multiple key saves and delivering a man-of-the-match display.",
      "Vitek performed like Peter Schmeichel in his prime and was only denied a clean sheet, which he deserved, in the final minutes when Rosenborg scored with an unstoppable effort.",
      "Vitek spent last term on loan with Accrington Stanley and that spell was considered a huge success due to the experience he gained and the volume of matches he played, but he's expected to play in a higher division next season and perhaps a Championship loan could come next.",
      "The young 'keeper was brilliant in the successful FA Youth Cup campaign of 2021/22 - Mainoo and Garnacho were in that team - and seems like a prospect worth keeping an eye on.",
      "Elsewhere, Harry Amass has a chance of making the USA squad after a superb season with the U18s, who won a stunning treble and claimed two of those trophies at the expense of City.",
      "Amass took part in first-team training in February when he was just 16 years old and he signed his first professional contract a month later when he celebrated his birthday.",
      "The left-back signed for United from Watford in 2023. Amass is considered one of the most exciting talents in English football and, although he still has scope to develop physically, Ten Hag trusted him enough to include him in matchday squads at the end of last season.",
      "A young player who has an outside chance of making the squad is Jack Fletcher, the talented son of former United player Darren Fletcher, who is now part of Ten Hag's coaching staff.",
      "Sources at United believe Fletcher has first-team potential and while his progress was briefly delayed last season due to an injury, he's now back to full fitness again.",
      "United's tour of the USA is upon us and fans should closely follow which youngsters are included. They could be starring for the first team before you know it.",

      "The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term, missing out on European qualification and winning just 10 of their 22 league games. A number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, have left the club this summer, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway. However, the long-awaited arrival of Ashworth from Newcastle could be exactly what United Women need to progress next term.",
      "Addressing the Carrington revamp in an open letter to supporters on Monday, Ashworth said: \"There are also changes to the physical environment at Carrington as work commences on our season-long £50 million redevelopment of the training ground – evidence of our commitment to improving the club’s infrastructure.",
      "“This will require some adaptation this season, but all our teams – men’s, women’s and academy – will maintain access to high-quality facilities, with the promise of a fully refreshed, world-class site once the project is completed.\"",
      "On his vision for Skinner's side, Ashworth added: “Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas. Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Norway international Elisabeth Terland on a free transfer from Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "The striker has penned a two-year deal with Marc Skinner's side, with an option for a further year. She has established herself as one of the most prolific forwards in the Women's Super League (WSL) since joining Brighton from SK Brann in 2022, scoring 20 goals in 39 appearances for the Seagulls.",
      "On the international stage, Terland has represented Norway at U15, U17 and U19 level, culminating in her inclusion in her country’s Euro 2022 squad. Speaking about her decision to join the Reds, the 23-year-old said: “I’m so honoured to sign for Manchester United and cannot wait to join up with the team.",
      "\"Having experienced their excellent fans from the opposing side, I’m really looking forward to having them in my corner this season.”",
      "Manager Skinner added: “Elisabeth is a young player who will bring a fresh dynamic and energy to our team. We are delighted she has chosen to become part of our Manchester United family and look forward to integrating her into our playing squad.”",
      "United finished fifth in the WSL last term and won the club's first major trophy after beating Tottenham Hotspur to the Women's FA Cup. Terland becomes the Reds' third signing of the summer following the additions of Netherlands international Dominique Janssen and striker Melvine Malard from Lyon.",
