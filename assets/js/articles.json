      "Matheus Cunha wants to join Manchester United - regardless of whether they are in Europe or not next season. Ruben Amorim's side are closing in on a move for the Brazilian to join on a permanent move in the summer.",
      "Cunha signed a new deal with Wolves at the start of February, featuring a £62million release clause, after his agent failed to land a move in January. Cunha has enjoyed a superb season with Wolves to help them avoid relegation, scoring 15 times in the Premier League. That has included three goals and two assists in his last six games.",
      "There are a number of teams who were credited with an interest in the 25-year-old in January, including Arsenal and Nottingham Forest, but United are now firmly at the front of the queue and are edging closer to sealing his transfer.",
      "United and Cunha have agreed all but the finer details on a package to take him to Old Trafford. The question is how and what exactly they will pay Wolves, with an agreement there not yet in place.",
      "United aren't expected to pay his full release clause up front, as per his contract, and are, it's understood, looking to negotiate a deal to pay a higher eventual figure, over a number of years.",
      "Amorim's men still don't know whether they will play in Europe next season as they prepare for their Europa League final against Tottenham on Wednesday night.",
      "Cunha's interest in joining United before their fate is confirmed certainly shows he is invested in the club and their future. It also displays the pull United have as a club in spite of their current woes on the pitch and financial difficulties under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is undergoing a significant cost-cutting regime at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha made it clear he sees himself moving away from Molineux in the future after saying he wanted to \"take the next step\" in his career.",
      "He said earlier this year: \"I had a lot of offers but I wouldn't feel well if I had done it. Some things you can't control but I couldn't leave the club in the middle of the season, in a difficult situation, in the relegation zone. Now, we're close to achieving our goal [of staying up]. But I've made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.\"",
      "Asked if Cunha wants to remain at Molineux on Monday, Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"You must ask him, but I feel he is happy.",
      "\"I just know he is my player, he is committed with the team, he is working with happiness and we will see what happens.\"",
      "United chief Amorim has already been asked about the prospect of signing Cunha but refused to wade into the topic. He said: “I will not say nothing about Matheus, because if I say I have to say 'yes' or 'no' and not comment on that.",
      "\"We have to focus on this season and the way we prepare for next season could change in these games, so it's difficult to predict what can happen in the future.\""

      "Mason Mount is hoping Europa League glory can help relaunch his stalled Manchester United career. England star Mount has endured a difficult time since joining United from Chelsea in a £55million deal in 2023.",
      "The attacking midfielder has spent much of the last two seasons sidelined with serious injuries and admitted it has been tough to effectively see two years of his career wiped out.",
      "Mount also suffered the heartbreak of being part of the England squad which lost the Euro 2020 final to Italy at Wembley and admitted he still carries the pain of that defeat.",
      "But Mount said beating Tottenham in Wednesday's all-or-nothing Europa League final in Bilbao would go some way towards making up for those setbacks and disappointments.",
      "\"The football side of it and the injuries is something that obviously I didn’t see coming,” said Mount, who came off the bench to score twice late on in United's 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao, which clinched their place in the final.",
      "\"That's not been easy. I've had many days sitting on the treatment bed where I want to be training. I've been in the stand watching games, when I want to be playing. But those were the circumstances.",
      "\"And I think you do remember that the losses are hard. I've had quite a few at Wembley and they stick with you for a long time.",
      "\"I don’t know how many of the lads have had too much experience of that, but I can tell you I've had quite a few losses and I don’t want that feeling again. We will do everything we can to win that game. You really appreciate it more.\"",
      "\"When you do win, you realise that feeling and you always want that feeling when you're playing in finals.",
      "Mount admitted United owe their loyal fans a trophy, having put them through the club's worst season of the Premier League era and the most calamitous since relegation in 1973-74.",
      "\"As a group, we always try to block out the noise,” said Mount. “But we know the situation we're in.",
      "\"We know the league isn't good enough and we've not been good enough in that, but the Europa League is something that we can look forward to as a final. We want to win the final. It's a trophy and it's Champions League football next season.",
      "\"We'll do everything in our power to win that game. But we won't forget about what we have done in the league and our league form.",
      "\"That's something we need to work on for next season. We know we need to work on that. This is a final and if we can win it, it can be a positive end to a tough season.",
      "\"Every single game we play at home they're there. The fans are supporting us, they're loud.",
      "\"We need to give something back. Winning the final might not solve everything, but it will give them something to cheer about and it's a trophy. Hopefully we can do that and be proud of it.\""

      "\"I was on the bench before. I was young. I had no experience, but it was a good experience for me to be in my first Europa League final with the team. At the time, we had great players like Paul Pogba and Edison Cavani. It was a dream for me, honestly.",

      "Crystal Palace star Dean Henderson may have been the hero as the Eagles won the FA Cup on Saturday, but his tussle with Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola also calls to mind a stand-off he had with another Premier League manager.",
      "The Palace keeper, 28, was the star of the show at Wembley Stadium, making numerous saves, including one from the penalty spot, to help his side win their first-ever major trophy. Yet at the end of the game, Guardiola could be seen exchanging heated words with the England international over reported time-wasting.",
      "Henderson looks to have finally found his footballing home after spending several seasons out on loan while being on the books at Manchester United. And it was former United boss Erik ten Hag who faced the brunt of Henderson's anger when the Dutchman contacted the England star over his future in 2023.",
      "Ten Hag spoke to Henderson, who was then on loan at Nottingham Forest, in an attempt to bring him back to United after Martin Dubravka's loan spell at the Red Devils came to an end and he returned to Newcastle.",
      "Henderson had been informed that his development would be better served if he returned to his parent club instead of continuing at the City Ground.",
      "Ten Hag finally got in contact with his wantaway goalkeeper, almost seven months after taking charge at United, with the keeper having reportedly 'p****d off' Ten Hag by absconding to Forest before he could have a chat with him.",
      "The Dutchman's conversation with Henderson was reported to be a brief affair, however, with the shot-stopper point-blank refusing to go back to Old Trafford as he desperately wanted out of the club in a bid to secure first-team football.",
      "Speaking back upon Ten Hag's arrival in August 2022 to talkSport, Henderson detailed how he actually avoided United's then-new manager, running the former Ajax head coach's wrath.",
      "\"I didn't want the manager (Ten Hag) to come in and be able to see me in training,\" he said. \"I knew he'd probably want to keep me, so I tried to do it all before I left for the season. I told the hierarchy I need to go and play football, I don't want to be here playing second fiddle.",
      "\"It was all planned out. I was almost gone before the manager came through the door and I haven't spoken to him since.",
      "\"To be honest with you, it's probably been the toughest 12 months of my career. It's been tough, it's been hard and I'm so happy I've got out the other end of it.\"",
      "The United youth graduate had previously spoken out against his treatment by his parent club. His United future soured further when he was expected to take over as United's first-choice goalkeeper following David De Gea's difficult campaign in 2020.",
      "However, after contracting Covid-19, Henderson once again found himself out in the cold at Old Trafford. \"The conversation I had coming out of that Euros squad was ' you're coming back here [United] to be the number one goalkeeper',\" he added.",
      "\"I got Covid, and come back, I should have still been the number one, but unfortunately, no one followed through with anything they told me.",
      "\"It was frustrating because I turned down so many good loans last summer for that reason and they wouldn't let me go. So, it was frustrating. To sit there and waste 12 months, it's criminal really at my age. I was fuming. But I worked hard off the pitch and on the training pitch to keep improving day in, day out.\"",
      "After loan spells at Stockport County, Grimsby Town, Shrewsbury Town, Sheffield United and Forest, Henderson eventually ended his United limbo by sealing a switch to Palace, thought to be in the region of £20 million.",
      "He has since gone on to make 61 appearances and was handed the club's No. 1 jersey at the start of this season."

Leverkusen are bidding to replace Xabi Alonso, who confirmed his departure earlier this month and is expected to join Real Madrid after agreeing a return to the Bernabeu.",
      "Alonso, 43, enjoyed unprecedented success in his two-and-a-half years with Leverkusen, winning an unbeaten league and cup double last term before surrendering the title to a resurgent Bayern Munich this season. Succeeding him will be a tall order, especially with star trio Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz and Jonathan Tah unlikely to be part of the squad.",
      "Who'll be in charge of that squad remains to be seen, as Fabregas is said to be Bundesliga club's preferred candidate. Sky Germany report that Leverkusen are still locked in talks with Como, who Fabregas became the manager of last summer following their promotion to Serie A.",
      "Having been sacked by United in October, the Dutchman has been patient for his next role. Ten Hag is understood to be Leverkusen's second choice, as the German giants aim to complete the process by the end of next week.",
      "Sporting director Simon Rolfes addressed the situation following their 2-2 draw with Mainz on Saturday. \"No candidate has turned us down at any point during the entire process,\" he told Kicker.",

      "Last week, Fabregas revealed that he has spoken to other clubs but is happy to continue at Como, the club he part-owns, so long as everyone is 'aligned with his ideas.' \"I talked to the club, we made progress, I am happy here,\" the 38-year-old said.",
      "\"I want to understand if everyone wants to continue like this and they are all aligned with my ideas. I also spoke to other clubs, I am respectful and speak to everyone. There is to be an official announcement. I am happy, we all need to be on the same page to continue together.\""

      "Manchester United's transfer business has come under scrutiny again as some of their star men thrive out on loan. Antony and Marcus Rashford aren't the only ones enjoying a new lease on life away from Old Trafford, though.",
      "Last summer, United cashed in on Aaron Wan-Bissaka after triggering a one-year contract extension. They took a huge hit on the former Crystal Palace man, recouping less than a third of the £50million they paid for him in 2019.",
      "The 27-year-old had ups and downs at United, but has wasted little time impressing in his new surroundings. He has even scored two goals for the Hammers, matching his tally from 190 games at his previous club.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has been rewarded for that fast start by winning the Hammer of the Year award. Previous winners of the award - handed out to West Ham's player of the season - include current captain Jarrod Bowen and former skipper Declan Rice.",
      "The news hasn't escaped United fans, who have spotted a pattern of players improving after leaving the club. Scott McTominay is on the verge of a Serie A title with Napoli and Antony has reached the Conference League final with Betis, while Rashford's form for Aston Villa leaves them in with a shot of another season in the Champions League.",
      "\"Everyone that has left man united recently has turned into a goat,\" one fan wrote on social media. \"It’s not the fact that we sold him. It’s the fact we sold him for pennies compared to what he’s worth,\" was the verdict from another.",
      "\"Always saw the value of the Spidey,\" another United fan said. \"He was our best fullback who is clear of [Diogo[ Dalot and even [Luke] Shaw on a good day.\"",
      "Wan-Bissaka helped West Ham complete a first league double over United since back in 2006-07. He played the full 90 minutes in both games, a 2-1 home win in October and a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford in May, setting up a goal for Bowen in the latter.",
      "Upon joining West Ham in August, Wan-Bissaka explained his decision to move was an easy one. \"It was a no brainer for me to join West Ham – I’m excited and happy to be here,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s an amazing feeling to be back in London, and I’m excited for what’s coming. I was born here, so I know the ins and outs of London, which plays a big part in my life, so to be back playing in this city means a lot to me\"",
      "United managed to soften the blow by signing Noussair Mazraoui in a similar cut-price deal, with the former Bayern Munich defender impressing in his first season at Old Trafford. Even so, there are plenty who have been left frustrated that Wan-Bissaka was unable to build on his early Palace promise in a United shirt."

Radu Dragusin and Lucas Bergvall are also sidelined, as is loanee Timo Werner. Dane Scarlett, who has only just begun featuring in the first-team, is also denied the chance of playing in the final.",

      "Beyond that the United both is sweating on several issues in his backline. Matthijs De Ligt is struggling with a knee and Leny Yoro hobbled off in the loss to West Ham eight days ago.

      "Tottenham have already beaten the Manchester outfit on three occasions this season - twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup. However they are looking to end a trophy drought that dates back to 2008 and has hung over the club throughout that time.",
      "United meanwhile have continued to be dire in the Premier League and have lost six of their last eight games. Amorim can restore some pride with victory on Wednesday night, but has already claimed his side are \"not ready\" to be competitive domestically and in the Champions League."

      "Ian Wright has admitted that he would love to have Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes at Arsenal. Fernandes, 30, has been wearing the armband for the Red Devils in a campaign which has been terrible domestically, but still offers the opportunity for European silverware.",
      "While United could still gain qualification for the Champions League by beating Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, Arsenal will have to accept another campaign without a major trophy.",
      "With the season ending soon, attention is turning to the transfer window, where Arsenal are on the verge of signing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with a move for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres also potentially on the cards. However, Wright, who has previously defended Fernandes from a Roy Keane onslaught, would be over the moon to see his former side turn their attention to the Portugal international.",
      "While speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Wright said: \"I wish we had Bruno Fernandes. I wish we had Bruno. I would love to have him at Arsenal.\"",
      "The ex-Gunners striker has repeatedly defended the United skipper when Keane has unleashed him. After Wright's latest defence on the podcast last month, the ex-United skipper said: \"Ah Wrighty, I've had enough of that rubbish!",
      "\"You watch United every week, we focus more on United. Sit and watch a game with him! People pretend to be closing people down.",
      "\"Talent is not enough! You keep going back to talent - Bruno's a talented player, but it's not enough! Who were you in the dressing room with, Tony Adams! Tony Adams was this, Tony Adams was that, because he was a fighter!",
      "\"You've got young players who have to look at somebody and go, ‘I like what he does.’ They all can't put the ball in the top of the net from 25 yards, I get that, but you want someone who's going, 'Lads, are you with me? Are you with me?'\"",
      "Wright told Keane that comparing modern captains like Fernandes to the likes of Adams is unhelpful, saying: \"Maybe he's not that kind of captain, Roy, I'm with you, but what he's doing in respect of... saving you, playing that pass, the goal. If Bruno's not there, United are in the relegation battle.”",
      "Despite Wright's admiration of Fernandes, it's unlikely the Gunners would target a move for him. Arteta already has club captain Martin Odegaard in Fernandes' position, while Declan Rice is being encouraged to maraud forward more often.",
      "Zubimendi's potential arrival would only encourage the aforementioned duo to occupy more forward positions, while Kai Havertz may also be given more opportunities to play behind a striker should the Gunners sign a centre-forward like Gyokeres. Moreover, the chances of United doing business with Arsenal for a player as important as Fernandes are also highly unlikely.",
      "The silky playmaker's deal expires in the summer of 2027, but there appears to be no sign that he is agitating for a move out of Old Trafford. However, reports from the Daily Star at the end of March claimed Real Madrid were interested in the midfielder and were considering a shock £90million move.",
      "If United lose the final in Bilbao on Wednesday, then Fernandes, who has been at the club since January 2020, will have to face up the reality of another season without Champions League football, despite his undoubted quality. While the season has been a poor one for United, he has still contributed 19 goals and 19 assists in all competitions.",
      "The ex-Sporting midfielder's numbers are far superior to Odegaard's, who has struggled to replicate his performances from the 2023/24 campaign. The Norwegian has only managed five goals and 11 assists compared to last year's record of 11 goals and 12 assists."

United have suffered their worst season of the Premier League era, with Ruben Amorim's under-performing side down in 16th place, after 18 defeats this season.",
      "But United can still salvage something from their otherwise miserable season by beating Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. As well as lifting the trophy, the winners will also go straight into next season's Champions League, which is worth up to £100million in revenue.",
      "And although their domestic form has been pitiful, Mazraoui claimed that will largely be forgotten if Amorim's players are victorious against Spurs. “Winning a trophy is never easy,” said Mazraoui.",

      "In contrast to losing almost half of their Premier League games this season, United are the only team that started out in the Europa League or Champions League to remain unbeaten. It is something United defender Mazraoui cannot explain.",
      "“That's something really tough to say, because we always manage in the Europa League to eventually win,” said the Morocco international. “I think the biggest example was Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last 10 minutes of the game. Extra-time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.",
      "“I think one of the biggest differences in the Europa League and the Premier League for us this season is how to manage to win. We maybe have that kind of fighting spirit in the Europa League that we maybe lack in the Premier League.”",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "Mazraoui was signed by former United manager Erik ten Hag, who made way for current boss Amorim whose forthright and straight-talking approach has been welcomed by the defender. “I like him a lot in that respect,” said Mazraoui.",
      "“He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything. That's how I am as well. I'm not hiding behind anything and that's the manager as well.",
      "“He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him.”",
      "Tottenham have beaten United on all three occasions they have met this season, but Mazraoui claimed that will have no bearing on the outcome of Wednesday's make-or-break showdown.",
      "“I don't think so, because this is a whole different competition,” said Mazraoui. “It's the Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you can't really compare any previous games with this final.",
      "“Tottenham bring a lot of intensity in their games. We've seen that already this season. That's their biggest quality - they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything they do.”"

      "Roy Keane has never been far removed from Manchester United almost 20 years after his controversial Old Trafford exit. The iconic midfielder won 13 major honours during his 12 years at the club, and is regularly seen assessing United games as a pundit.",
      "Despite his legacy at the club, Keane agreed to leave by mutual consent in November 2005, stemming from comments made on MUTV about his team-mates following a heavy defeat to Middlesbrough. Two decades later, he pulled no punches as United, who sit 16th in the Premier League, continued to fall well below his standards.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.” Here’s a closer look at how Keane’s relationship with United has altered over the years.",
      "Keane has spoken extensively about his shock exit from United. The former captain would end his career at Celtic, but the club’s decision had a long-term impact on Keane’s relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The Irishman was known as a tough-tackling midfielder with a hardman persona on the pitch. However, when speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in February, he admitted the emotional toll that it took on him: \"When I left United, I did cry that morning. Cried in my car,” Keane said.",
      "It was not the first time Keane had reflected on the raw emotion that came with his departure from United. “I think the only time I really cried was when I left United after I had a bit of a disagreement with a few people, but other than that you're very much in that bubble,\" Keane previously told Tommy Tiernan.",
      "\"You're in the zone. I always say I was in the zone. I used to say to people, and they didn't quite understand it, I was going to war every week.\"",
      "The manner of his exit meant that Keane had a different view of the club than many of his United team-mates, despite being crucial to the glory that they achieved under Ferguson. However, almost 18 years later, Keane shocked supporters by appearing in the reveal video for United’s third kit in 2023.",
      "A joint statement from the club and kit manufacturer said: “Manchester United and Adidas are proud to work with Roy Keane, one of the club’s most iconic and popular former players. Roy won 17 trophies with Manchester United, his fearless playing style and never give up attitude has earned him a special place in the hearts of Manchester United fans around the world.”",
      "Keane has been vocal about United's relative underachievement since Ferguson stepped down as manager in 2013. The 53-year-old has been brutally honest in his assessment of various United players, but former team-mate Mikael Silvestre feels that the club can use Keane’s feedback to their advantage, and backed him to join current boss Ruben Amorim’s staff in an advisory role",
      "“I think it would be great for Roy Keane to play a role at Manchester United,” Silvestre told Yaysweepstakes.com. “Because, the thing is with Roy, he always treated everybody exactly the same way. It didn’t matter if you were a new signing, an old guy, the manager, everybody.",
      "\"That's how he got respect. That's how Sir Alex got respect. If you treat everybody the same, no problem. I think it’s a bit of a problem with this generation of players. They find criticism harder to take.",
      "\"If Roy Keane was involved at Manchester United, if he was on the inside with the group, he would have to protect and work for the group. You wouldn’t see him criticising players in public, so there wouldn't be any issue.”",
      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer agreed with Silvestre and saw the value in the expertise that Keane could pass on to his squad. In 2019, Solskjaer invited Keane to the club’s Carrington training ground to speak to the players, four years before he would feature in the kit reveal video.",
      "In terms of how the meeting unfolded, a source told the Mirror: “As you’d imagine, Roy has strong views on what it takes to be a proper United player, and he gave it to them straight.",
      "“He wasn’t impressed with one player who didn’t seem to be all that interested and looked as if he’d rather be somewhere else. But for the majority, it was a fascinating snapshot into the hunger and desire that drove Roy during his time at the club.”",
      "Keane may have reached some form of truce with United in recent years, but that has not prevented him from sharing his thoughts on the current hierarchy. Before Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim this season, Keane suggested that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those in charge of football operations had undermined the Dutch coach by changing his backroom staff.",
      "\"I'm not saying he's not a good manager or he hasn't got good coaching staff, but in the summer they changed all the coaching staff,” Keane argued on the Stick to Fooball podcast. “So you're on about a manager having a bit of power and control of the football club – I'll bet you Ten Hag's got none of that!",
      "\"So players will look at the manager and go, 'Well, all your staff went in the summer. I didn't see you fighting for any of them. You're bringing more staff in.' I just think it looks chaotic, doesn't it?\"",
      "Keane has been frequently touted for the United job, despite last managing Ipswich Town in 2011. There was speculation that he could follow in the footsteps of United legends Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, and Michael Carrick by taking charge on an interim basis. However, Keane quickly shut down the suggestion, having already critiqued the manager’s lack of power at the club.",
      "\"They're not gonna be asking me. They just wouldn't... they just wouldn't,” Keane told Arsenal great Ian Wright. When asked about the possibility of taking over at Old Trafford on a short-term basis, Keane said: \"I'm not leaving you, Wrighty.“"

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund faces an anxious wait to learn if he will start Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham. Hojlund has struggled leading United's attack this season, scoring just 10 goals, and toiled again in Friday's abject 1-0 defeat at Chelsea.",
      "Ruben Amorim is working out his best line-up to beat Spurs in Bilbao, with the United boss considering dropping Hojlund on the bench.",
      "The return of Amad from injury has given Amorim greater attacking options and the United boss is said to be considering starting him against Spurs.",
      "That could see Hojlund displaced from the starting line-up, with captain Bruno Fernandes potentially playing as a false nine, supported by Amad and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Another option, which Amorim has already tried this season, would be to play Kobbie Mainoo as a false nine, with Fernandes deployed deeper.",
      "Amorim has yet to decide on his starting line-up, with three training sessions left before the £100million make-or-break showdown in Spain, with the winners earning a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "But Amorim is keen to retain the central midfield partnership of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte, which proved effective in the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Europa League.",
      "Ex-Red Devils boss Roy Keane delivered a scathing assessment of Hojlund in the wake of the Chelsea defeat, United's 18th in the league this season.",
      "Keane said: \"They've got no striker. Hojlund looked like he'd just come out of the academy. His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play. Again, if you're a striker playing for United - even for the whole team - one shot on target?'",
      "\"We keep making excuses for him. We talk about confidence, but you still think, when you're a striker, you have to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have - and what United have always had - is strikers who can produce something for themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they have quality, a bit of determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund.\""

      "Wayne Rooney has identified three key signings that could help Manchester United bounce back from their worst-ever Premier League season. And one of them is a return for former goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "The Red Devils, who have won the Premier League a record 13 times, are currently languishing in 16th place with a record low of 39 points. Their dismal league performances have continued under Ruben Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Despite their chronic struggles in the league, United will salvage Champions League football from the season if they can defeat Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "However, the squad clearly needs a complete overhaul to compete at the highest level domestically and in Europe next season. Rooney, United's all-time leading goalscorer, believes that the addition of his former team-mate De Gea, along with striker Victor Osimhen and defender Marc Guehi, could be the catalyst for a turnaround.",
      "Speaking to Amazon Prime Video Sport, the former England forward said: \"I'd probably sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he could still do a very good job.",
      "\"The second one, I would sign Osimhen. He's a number nine, I think he's a really good striker and possibly available. And the third one, it would be difficult but I'd sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back, I think he would have a really good impact on the club.\"",
      "De Gea enjoyed 12 seasons at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League title once and being crowned United's Player of the Season four times. The 34-year-old was let go in July 2023 and spent nearly a year searching for a new team before joining Fiorentina at the start of this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been a standout performer for the Serie A side, helping them to secure European football while making it to the Europa Conference League semi-finals. He is set to face United in a pre-season match this summer, which will undoubtedly be an emotional encounter for the Spaniard. His replacement, Andre Onana, who was brought in for his superior ball-playing skills, has made numerous high-profile blunders since his £47.2million arrival from Ajax in 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, another United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has made it clear what he thinks the team needs. He said: \"Forget Delap's ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him. It's not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn't need a competitor.\"",
      "England and Crystal Palace defender Guehi is in demand too. The 24-year-old, who has been linked with Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham, will come with a hefty price tag, especially after helping Palace to FA Cup glory against Manchester City."

      "Ruben Amorim's men will jet out to Bilbao this week hoping to beat Premier League rivals Tottenham in a bid to end their disastrous season with silverware, while also catapulting themselves into the Champions League.",
      "However, United come into the final in poor form, having lost five of their last six games in the Premier League and manager Amorim has even questioned whether he is the right man to take the team forward.",

      "Both of the club's transfer wishlists have been curated to put together a squad that will be able to deliver on Amorim's tactical vision - which has so far failed to come to fruition following 13 defeats in 26 games under the Portuguese boss.",
      "There have been some concerns that Amorim may walk out on the team at the end of the season after his brutal comments about the clubs' fortunes.",
      "He infamously claimed his side were \"the worst team in the history of Manchester United\" and also said he was \"embarrassed\" about their situation and they were \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\".",

United warmed up for their season-defining clash against Tottenham with a 1-0 loss to Chelsea and played a full-strength side - with Amorim keen to ensure his players are sharp going into the final.",
      "Amorim has been insistent that winning the trophy won't salvage their campaign and believes his team face many issues in the future regardless.",
      "He said: \"Europa League will not change anything in our problems - it's going to help us to have Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's reflections after Manchester United's FA Cup triumph last year hinted a lack of faith in his much-talked-about Project 150.",
      "Despite going in as underdogs against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, the Red Devils pulled off a stunning 2-1 victory, courtesy of goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo which overshadowed Jeremy Doku's goal. The win came as a shock to supporters up and down the country and marked the team's sole piece of silverware for the season.",
      "Ratcliffe, who holds a minority stake in United, didn't shy away from acknowledging his team's outsider status but heaped praise on their Wembley performance after the match. \"Manchester United were clearly not the favourites to win today,\" he previously said.",
      "He added: \"But they played with total commitment and skill and overcame one of the great teams in football. We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them.\"",
      "However, comments about not being favourites highlighted just how much of an uphill battle Project 150 – which aims to see United win the Premier League by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary – would be. The club's recent performances, including a record-low eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 season and a dreadful 2024/25 campaign in the Premier League, have highlighted the significant challenges they face in closing the gap with their rivals.",
      "Despite the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, the team continues to languish near the bottom of the table, on track for their worst-ever Premier League finish. And while Amorim has shown glimpses of promise, such as dragging the team to the Europa League final where they face fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham, it is clear that he needs time to adapt and shape the squad to his playing style.",
      "\"You've got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "It has been 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson departed Manchester United, and the club has struggled to replicate his success in the Premier League since then.",
      "The current state of the team suggests that it will be a long and challenging journey to return to the top of English football. Old Trafford has seen a parade of managers, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and now Amorim, all attempting to reverse the club's fortunes. But instead, they've seemingly slipped further down the league table.",
      "Another hurdle is the Premier League's PSR rules and regulations. In the January transfer window, United were only able to secure the services of Patrick Dorgu for £25million and promising Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven, while Marcus Rashford, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia were sent out on loan.",
      "If United can arrange permanent moves for these players, and if Chelsea decide to splash out £20m for Jadon Sancho following his loan stint at Stamford Bridge, it could help ease the club's substantial debts. As of March, the club was reported to be in debt to the tune of £733m, with an additional £315m owed in outstanding transfer fees."

      "Does he want to sit down?",
      "“No, it’s okay.”",
      "Amad has stood up and been counted plenty of times for Manchester United in what is effectively his first full season. Had he not succumbed to injury in mid-February, the Sir Matt Busby player of the year statue might have had a new home away from the Fernandes residence.",
      "We are speaking on the concourse of the Stretford End, doubling as a mixed zone on United’s Uefa media day for the Europa League final. It was at that end that Amad attained cult status with his Old Trafford winner for the ages against Liverpool in the FA Cup.",
      "That still did not signal a turning point. The 22-year-old had to wait until the home defeat to Arsenal in May last year to start a meaningful match for the club he signed for in October 2020. Before then, Amad had been restricted to three starts in heavily-rotated teams under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Ruben Amorim is Amad’s fifth manager and the one who has maximised him. Ruud van Nistelrooy merits a special mention for his management of Amad during that four-game caretaker stint in the autumn.",
      "The image of Van Nistelrooy avuncularly putting an arm around Amad’s shoulder on the touchline in Istanbul sticks out. Amad had watched Erik ten Hag put Antony on ahead of him against Fenerbahce.",
      "“I need the game time to show I can play for this club,” he says. “In that moment, I was a little bit frustrated because you can understand sometimes maybe you deserve to play and you don't play. You have a little bit of frustration.",
      "“But I think now it's because the manager believes in me. He believes in my potential. I'm trying to repay his confidence every time I'm on the pitch.",
      "“Honestly, Erik helped me a lot. He was giving me a lot of advice, even when I wasn't playing. He was telling me to train very hard every time. That's the most important thing when a manager keeps telling you to train hard, even if you don't play.",
      "“So I kept training very hard, very hard. I think this season, at the beginning, I was playing a lot with him. I want to thank him again for the opportunity he gave me and I want to wish him all the best.”",
      "Amad was a one-man band in attack before he sustained an ankle injury in training in February. He was pressing Andre Onana and his left foot remained entrenched in the turf when he attempted to turn.",
      "He reflects on the two-and-a-half-month lay-off positively. Amad required surgery and “kept praying to be back before the end of the season. So this happened and now I'm happy.",
      "“I'm always positive, I'm always smiling with everyone, so that's my natural thing. That's me, that's Amad, so I always try to grow up with positive things.”",
      "His development at United was interrupted by significant injuries. A thigh strain prevented Amad from joining Feyenoord on loan in August 2021 and a knee injury sustained in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July 2023 kept him out for five months. Amad left the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on a golf buggy clutching crutches.",
      "He returned to United that summer as a cult hero at Sunderland. On Tuesday, he was back at the Stadium of Light, where he was paraded during the interval of Sunderland’s Play-off tie with Coventry City.",
      "United’s former football director John Murtough was convinced that Amad needed ten successive starts to demonstrate his qualities. During his first ten-match starting streak with Sunderland, he tallied six goals.",
      "“I believe in my potential,” Amad stresses. “I believe I can be one of the best in the world. I just have to give my best every game. That's it. But I think I believe in my potential.\"",
      "Back in the United States with United in the summer, his stock was so much higher United chose him as the player to chair a press conference. Amad’s English has improved since then and he is not as shy.",
      "His social media persona suggests he is more extroverted than his softly-spoken nature suggests. “UNITER WILL NEVER DIED,” he tweeted from the dressing room after the mother of all Old Trafford comebacks against Lyon. “Congrat manu (Ugarte) for your’re s**t goal, f**k Garna for that miss, you gaves us pain heart.”",
      "Someone asked if it was Amad’s actual account. “No, Amorim account,” he dryly replied.",
      "“I was so happy,” he laughs. “Honestly, I'm a good guy with everyone. I just posted that tweet on my X. That was funny, no?",
      "“We are really close. We are really close with Garna. Kobbie, Leny, everyone. I have good relationships with everyone. Like I said before, I have good energy, good vibes. Everyone likes to be with me.”",
      "And it’s definitely him tweeting? “Yeah, it's me, it's me. Nobody (else), it's me. It's Amad!”",
      "The Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur will be Amad’s third. He was an unused substitute in penalty shootout defeats with United in 2021 and a year later on loan at Rangers.",
      "Although his transfer to United was agreed on deadline day in October 2020, Amad arrived in Manchester in January 2021. He had a virtuoso stint in the Under 21s before Solskjaer gave him a handful of opportunities. He scored an adroit header on his third appearance against AC Milan.",
      "During the unsuccessful shootout against Villarreal in Gdansk, Amad could be seen praying. “Yes, I already lost two. I hope to win this one. I keep praying for that one. It will be really good for me, but also for the team because at the end of the day, we want some things at the end of the season.",
      "“I was on the bench. I was young. I had no experience, but it was a good experience for me to be in my first Europa League final with the team. At the team, we had great players like (Paul) Pogba and (Edinson) Cavani. It was a dream for me, honestly.",
      "“But now it's my moment. It's the moment for the club, it's the moment for the players, for everyone, for the fans because they deserve this moment. We will give everything, we will give our best to try and win this competition.”",
      "Amad has lined up on the wing and as the No.10 in his two starts since returning from injury. He seems likely to line up in the latter role in Bilbao.",
      "“Honestly, I don't have a preference,” he insists. “I'm a player who likes to play, and I'm available for every position. So if the manager prefers to put me as a right wing back, I will be more happy to play there or Number 10. I have no preference. I just want to follow the manager and his system.",
      "“The difference as right wing back (is), because you have to track back, you're a defender. You're more defender, and also you have to attack. Number 10 is more as a forward player. The difference is only this one, but I'm available for everything.”",
      "He will be denied a reunion with his former Atalanta teammate and schoolmate, Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent surgery on his patella last week. “Tottenham, even without Kulusevski, they are a really good team,” Amad cautions. “So we are not here to think about Kulusevski. But Kulusevski is a good player.",
      "“Kulusevski and Tottenham, they are really good. So I want to wish him good luck. But we are here to focus on what we can do.”",
      "Rather than be sat on the bench, Amad will be stood on the pitch for this final."

      "That sounds like Henderson, a violet that does not shrink. It was in keeping with his bolshy personality that Henderson revelled in the post-match confrontation with Pep Guardiola at Wembley on Saturday. “You got your ten minutes,” he quipped, holding out both hands in case Guardiola hadn’t heard.",

There was brilliance with the denials of Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush but also that rashness when he carried the ball out for a corner and patted it away from outside his area. He fortuitously avoided expulsion.",
      "Henderson travelled to Wembley with United for the League Cup final against Southampton in 2017. He was involved in the warm-up but back in his Paul Smith suit for the dressing room celebrations, clutching a bottle of beer. He had a taste for success, and got his hands on the trophy, but did not get a medal.",

      "When Henderson joined Stockport County in early 2016, some of his teammates in the United academy derided him for stooping to non-league football. His adviser assured him they would not have a career in the game. Henderson was shortly recalled amid injury to David de Gea and on the bench at Shrewsbury Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup.",
      "Shortly after he joined Grimsby Town later that year, Henderson informed the Grimsby Telegraph he intended to become the best goalkeeper in the world. He was 19.",
      "That fourth-tier loan stint was compelling enough for Shrewsbury Town to recruit him on loan in 2017. Henderson saved his first penalty at Wembley in the League One Play-off final.",
      "Carelessly, United had allowed Henderson to enter the final months of his first professional contract in 2018. A bump in pay and a loan to Sheffield United safeguarded their investment. Luke Shaw’s sister, Nicole, was present for Henderson’s contract signing as part of work experience with the Stellar agency. It was the first of three new deals in successive years.",
      "Jose Mourinho liked the cut of Henderson’s jib, so much so that he felt he was the best 'keeper at United when Mourinho was manager of Tottenham. United, though, were in the midst of negotiations for a new contract for De Gea in the summer of 2018. De Gea’s feeble performances for Spain at the World Cup in Russia marked the start of a gradual decline.",
      "Even after De Gea renewed in September 2019, United had a loose succession plan: let Henderson get a top-flight season under his belt, integrate him into the squad and then promote him.",
      "United did not reckon on the indecisive Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, though. Solskjaer indicated Henderson would fly to Perth for the pre-season tour after his Under 21 European Championship commitments. The only United Henderson planned on linking up with was in Sheffield.",
      "When Henderson returned to Manchester in August 2020, he was remunerated handsomely: a £100,000-a-week contract. Chelsea offered United £40million for him at one stage.",
      "Suddenly, United had two ‘keepers on a combined weekly salary of nearly £500,000. De Gea’s form suffered amid credible competition in 2020-21 and several United players thought Henderson should have replaced him after their Champions League group stage ejection by RB Leipzig.",
      "It took a pregnancy for Henderson to gain number-one status. De Gea’s partner, Edurne Garcia, was about to give birth in March 2021 and De Gea flew back to Spain for the arrival of his daughter, Yanay. Covid-19 protocols ensured De Gea would miss at least four games. Henderson was promised a six-match run: Crystal Palace, Manchester City, AC Milan at home, West Ham, Milan away and Leicester City.",
      "He kept clean sheets in four of the games and atoned for Milan defender Simon Kjaer’s late equaliser in the first leg with a decent denial of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at San Siro.",
      "De Gea was out of quarantine and available for the Milan and Leicester ties but they were in the Europa League and FA Cup and Henderson was United’s cup goalie. After the March internationals, Henderson lined up in the home fixture against Brighton and De Gea started against Granada, clear confirmation Henderson was first choice.",
      "The man-management rotation was mismanagement. De Gea earned a start in the Europa League final yet endured the worst possible penalty-shootout, conceding all 11 kicks and then having his kick saved in sudden death.",
      "The pressure got to Henderson, too. Conscious that De Gea had a reputation for staying on his line, he charged out to the edge of the 18-yard box to punch away a cross but was beaten to it by Chris Wood. The Burnley striker scored but was flagged offside.",
      "After the season ended, Solskjaer informed Henderson he would be installed as number one. Henderson, who withdrew from England’s European Championship squad with a quad injury, attended the final, soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in Boxpark Wembley, contracted Covid and was laid low for two months. De Gea remained number one, regained form and Henderson played a meagre three games in 2021-22.",
      "Henderson visited St James’ Park at the end of that season but Newcastle United lost their nerve and Burnley’s relegation made a permanent move for Nick Pope straightforward. Henderson moved to another newly-promoted team in Nottingham Forest.",
      "United banked a derisory £15m fee, rising to £20m, from Palace in August 2023. Dougie Freedman, the club’s sporting director, was in the Old Trafford directors’ box for Henderson’s last matchday squad involvement with a club he joined at the age of 14 in 2011.",
      "By that point, Henderson was so itching to leave United permanently he was loitering around the away dressing room in the tunnel.",
      "Henderson has said he regrets a piqued interview he gave to Talksport upon his loan move to Forest. Some United fans bizarrely booed him when he returned with Palace in the League Cup last season. There was a myth that he leaked information when the finger of blame could be pointed at someone else who is long since gone."

      "After Manchester United failed to win any of their opening three matches in the Europa League this season, few would have banked on them reaching the final in Bilbao.",
      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",
      "After the way in which this Europa League campaign started and a managerial alteration needing to be made just months into the season, United deserve credit for reaching a European final. Now they need to win it."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, May 19.",
      "The build-up, and the nerves, have begun as Ruben Amorim's men make their final preparations for the season-defining Europa League final in Bilbao. Tottenham Hotspur stand between United and a place in next season's Champions League which would be huge considering how poor this season has been.",
      "Matheus Cunha is said to be closing in on a move to United after a fine season at Wolves. Reports suggest the Brazilian is close to agreeing personal terms over a move to Old Trafford.",
      "A place in the Champions League next season would allow United to attract a better quality of player. Reports circulating around the club claim that one such target is Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez.",
      "The pantomime villain appeared to bid an emotional farewell to the home fans on Friday night after the victory over Spurs and it is claimed United have put an offer down to the Argentine, along with Barcelona. Elsewhere, the hunt for Rayan Cherki's signature is likely to intensify with the Ligue 1 season now done.",
      "It is thought the winger will be available for £19m in the summer which is considered a bargain after his output for Lyon this year. Meanwhile, the race for a striker will continue to gather pace as clubs across Europe try to add to their attack.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with a move to the Premier League but his final destination of Old Trafford or Arsenal's Emirates Stadium is yet to be decided.",
      "With all this in mind, make sure to stick with the United blog below for all of the updates...",
      "While the news that Arsenal could be closing in on Gyokeres may be seen as disheartening, there are no guarantees that the move would pan out.",
      "His goals return is phenomenal but his only experience of regular English football was with Coventry City in the Championship.",
      "We have seen countless times before that the switch from the second tier to the Premier League and even from one country's top tier to another can be too much to bridge.",
      "Delap on the other hand is unquestionably cheaper and having performed in the Premier League for a relegation-bound side, there is every chance he could be a success in Manchester.",
      "An alternative option to Delap would be Ruben Amorim's former Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "He scored his 53rd goal of the season on Saturday as the Lisbon club beat their city rivals Benfica to the Portuguese league title.",
      "In the aftermath, newspaper O Jogo has run with the story that the 'Swede is on his way to Arsenal.'",
      "Like United, the Gunners have been long-term admirers of Gyokeres and it is claimed a £58.9m deal for the striker is all but agreed.",
      "Speaking to Suffolk News, former United man Luke Chadwick has claimed he has faith that Delap will be a success at Old Trafford if he returns to the north west in this transfer window.",
      "He's a bit of a throwback, isn't he? You saw him growing up at Man City and physically, he was always above the other players within his age group and you wondered, would he take that into professional football? He went out on a couple of loans where he wasn't fantastic and then went to Ipswich, where he's been great. You only have to look at the amount of goals he's scored in the Premier League. He seems to, particularly a few months in, have grown in arrogance – in a good way. You see him at Old Trafford (in February) and he's shoving them all over the place and he's getting stuck into it. It feels like he's at a time now where he can go and play at a top club. Unfortunately, Man United isn’t the top club at the moment, but I think bringing someone like that in would be brilliant for Man United. I think it would be a brilliant move for Delap as well.",
      "Following the expected arrival of Cunha in the summer transfer window, you feel the Reds will then shift their focus to a centre-forward.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is their top target for that position.",
      "His relatively small price tag of £30m is seen as tempting by the Reds while his age and goal return this season (22 and 12 respectively) are believed to be playing in his favour.",
      "However there was a factor which was bothering him.",
      "He looks like he’s got the attributes that Ruben Amorim wants. He knows that physically, his team are just not strong or quick enough, so Matheus Cunha is obviously athletic, and he’s got quality with 15 league goals this season. I just worry for any signing coming to Manchester United at the minute. It just feels like it’s such a bad place to go. The quality of play right now is so poor. And with Cunha, is he a centre-forward or is he a wide player? There’s no doubt that he has quality and of course, it would be nice to sign him, but I worry about where he fits in. You can sign the best three players in the world, and I think they’ll struggle coming into this team at the minute, but they’ve got to start somewhere.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves to United appears to be in motion as the transfer window prepares to open next month.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano reported on Monday morning that Cunha had 'agreed to the project' at Old Trafford and the Reds are closing in on the deal.",
      "MEN Sport understands that the Brazilian is a top target for Ineos and Amorim this summer and United are ready to pay his £62.5m release clause.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on this Monday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be covering the updates on the Reds until 5pm.",
      "To get things started, let's catch you up, if you are just joining us, on the big stories emanating from Old Trafford today.",
      "With reports that Matheus Cunha is close to completing a move to Manchester United, the deals don't appear to be stopping there.",
      "Last week, the MEN reported that United were targeting at least three priority signings.",
      "And among them was Liam Delap.",
      "Betfair have compiled the odds with United being favourites to sign the Ipswich Town star.",
      "Man United - 2/1",
      "Chelsea - 3/1",
      "Newcastle - 9/2",
      "Nottingham Forest - 17/2",
      "Man City - 10/1",
      "Arsenal, Liverpool & Everton - 14/1",
      "It comes after their final day disappointment which saw them lose out on the Eredivisie title to PSV Eindhoven.",
      "Head coach Francesco Farioli decided to leave the club as a result.",
      "Now, Ten Hag is a contender for an Amsterdam comeback.",
      "He tweeted: \"Ajax are now seriously considering Erik ten Hag, following Francesco Farioli’s decision to leave the club. Confirmed.",
      "\"Paul #Simon is is another candidate.",
      "\"Ten Hag is also on Bayer 04 Leverkusen’s list, as previously reported.\"",
      "Manchester United have a number of injury concerns heading into the Europa League final this week and their opponents Tottenham are no different.",
      "Spurs are set to be without some of their key players as they aim to rescue something from what has been a sorry season. While United escaped their Friday night clash with Chelsea unscathed on the injury front, Ange Postecoglou was handed another injury worry as Pape Sarr picked up a knock. Youngster Mikey Moore also had to be replaced in the defeat to Aston Villa.",
      "Ahead of their clash with United, here is all the very latest on the Spurs injury front:",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Man United are closing in on a deal to sign Matheus Cunha.",
      "It has been said that the Wolves star is close to agreeing personal terms with the details to be finalised.",
      "The reporter claims that a deal is close to be completed making him Ruben Amorim's third signining after Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven.",
      "What do you make of the report, happy? Leave a comment below.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire admits he doesn't know how the supporters have stuck with them but they deserve to celebrate Europa League success.",
      "\"We know it's not been good enough this season, we take responsibility for that as players. We've had two managers and results haven't been good enough, and that's got to be down to us.",
      "\"To play in a European final for Manchester United is a huge occasion. Our fans deserve it - they've been absolutely incredible this season. I don't know how and why they're sticking with us as much as they are, because we've disappointed them so many times. But they've stuck with us and they deserve something to celebrate.",
      "\"It's going to be a great day for them, but it'll only be a great day if we go and lift that trophy.",
      "\"It's going to be a good game, a tough game, we know that Spurs will be right up for it as well, but it's one I'm looking forward to.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a transfer bombshell after Portuguese media reports suggested on Monday that they have lost the race for Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The Swedish striker has been on the radar of United since November when Ineos poached his manager in Lisbon, Ruben Amorim. A clear problem for United this season has been their lack of goals with both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee missing as reliable threats.",
      "Gyokeres has bagged a whopping 96 goals for Sporting this season and the fact he is familiar with the 3-4-2-1 system made it appear as though a transfer would be a match made in heaven for United. However, Arsenal have also been heavily linked with his services having admired him for longer than the Reds.",
      "Like United, the Gunners have also struggled without a regular centre-forward presence at the top of the pitch. While their season has been more impressive than the Reds', Mikel Arteta's side are likely wanting to address that position as a priority.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper O Jogo, that is exactly what they have done. Their front page leads with an image of Gyokeres celebrating after winning the Liga Portugal this weekend.",
      "One of the headlines next to his name reads: \"Swede on his way to Arsenal.\" It is claimed that a £58.9m agreement has been reached between Sporting and the Gunners and it is only a matter of time before the transfer is made official.",
      "If true, United will be looking to reassess their options heading into the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands that Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is a top target for United this summer thanks in part to his much lower release clause of £30m.",
      "It is also believed that Delap's proven ability in the Premier League - as shown with 12 goals for relegated Ipswich - and his age are also seen as positives. Versatile forward Matheus Cunha is also seen as a top target for United and has a £62.5m release clause in his Wolverhampton Wanderers contract."

      "Manchester United's great survivor could start in the Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "Victor Lindelof started against Villarreal in the 2021 Europa League final in Gdansk and he could be given an unlikely shot at redemption in the competition against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Lindelof started against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and is likely to retain his starting role for United's biggest game of the season due to Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro having injuries.",
      "United will leave it late to decide on the fitness of De Ligt and Yoro. But even if either of the pair are given the green light to make the squad in Bilbao, they might not be fit enough to start and Lindelof is waiting in the wings.",
      "Yoro recently left Old Trafford without a protective boot after facing West Ham, which was seen as a positive sign, although De Ligt's situation just a few weeks earlier shows that might not necessarily mean good news.",
      "The bright side is that Yoro was spotted going into the gym at Carrington to do his own individual work earlier in the week, and Amorim initially said that he thought his issue was \"small.\"",
      "Yoro has improved each month during his debut season in Manchester and would be a nailed-on starter against Tottenham if he's fit enough to play. That remains to be seen, though.",
      "Lindelof is set to leave United upon the expiry of his contract at the end of the season. His deal expires officially on June 30 and starting him in the Europa League would not be ideal.",
      "How many clubs have started players who are about to leave on a free transfer in European finals? Lindelof's contract has been allowed to run down and United have not offered him a new deal for a reason.",
      "Lindelof was supposed to leave Old Trafford last summer, but he sustained an injury in pre-season, which blocked his exit, and he returned to full training at Carrington in late September.",
      "The 30-year-old would have expected to be a peripheral squad member throughout this campaign, however, he has been needed to contribute in a handful of big games due to injuries.",
      "Lindelof has bags of experience and should be capable of filling in on the big stage, despite his contract situation. He arrived at United in the summer of 2017 and Luke Shaw is the only player in the dressing room who has been at the club for longer.",
      "This season was supposed to be low-key for Lindelof, but he has suddenly become important again and it's pretty staggering that he could start in another Europa League final for United.",
      "Lindelof might also be joined by Shaw in the back-three alongside Harry Maguire. Those three players started at Stamford Bridge and all played important roles during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure.",
      "Solskjaer oversaw the 2021 Europa League final against Villarreal. Maguire's absence in that final due to injury was a huge blow, but Lindelof and Shaw started in the defeat to the Spaniards on penalties.",
      "Ayden Heaven returned to the squad against Chelsea and came on from the bench with 10 minutes remaining. Tyler Fredricson is another option, but they could obviously not be thrown in.",
      "Amorim's best defensive options for the final could be three players who Solskjaer loved."

      "Manchester United will be looking to add new talent to their squad in the summer transfer window, but the level of player that comes through the door could depend on the outcome of the Europa League final.",
      "It's been a horrendous domestic season for United, with Ruben Amorim's side set to end the campaign with the worst points tally in the club's Premier League history. United sit 16th in the table with one game to go, but they've been handed a lifeline after a strong run in the Europa League.",
      "A 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao means United will take on Tottenham in the Europa League final later this week, and if Amorim's side win the competition, they will be guaranteed Champions League football next season. That will have a huge impact on United's summer transfer window, with playing in Europe's biggest competition a big appeal for players all over the globe.",
      "But, if United were to lose the Europa League final and have no European football, then the calibre of players available changes. So, to see how United's summer might go, we simulated the upcoming transfer window for if United win the final and if they lose to see what players Amorim's side could bring to Old Trafford. To set up this simulation, we used the Football Manager 2024 editor to simulate the 2025 summer transfer window. This is what happened.",
      "Despite not winning the Europa League, United still spent nearly £89.25million in the summer transfer window. Norwegian youngster Antonio Nusa signed for £44million, with United paying over the odds for the RB Leipzig attacker to pry him away from the German club he only joined last summer.",
      "A new striker arrived, with Liam Delap joining from Ipswich Town for £30million after his side's relegation from the Premier League. Young AZ goalkeeper Rome Jayden Owusu-Oduro joined from AZ to offer more competition, while 20-year-old Anan Khalaili joined for £3.4million, though he was instantly sent on loan to Blackburn Rovers for the upcoming campaign.",
      "With Champions League football, United were able to attract some big names in the summer transfer window as they splashed £154million, the biggest being Wolves' Matheus Cunha for £54million. Amorim's side attempted to sign the Brazilian in the other simulation, but he wanted Champions League football so moved to Arsenal instead.",
      "Delap signed for £30million with United adding two Premier League-proven attackers to their squad. Highly-rated Swedish midfielder Hugo Larsson signed from Eintracht Frankfurt for £39million, while Amorim boosted his midfield options once more with the arrival of ex-United star Angel Gomes, with the Englishman signing for free after his contract with Lille ran out.",
      "Lastly, one more defensive addition was made, with Amorim continuing to focus on Premier League players as the club signed Ezri Konsa from Aston Villa for £31million, potentially rising to £36million with add-ons."

      "When Manchester United fell to what was their 17th defeat of the Premier League campaign, the mood was undeniably flat considering it came at the hands of a West Ham team who are also waiting for the season to end.",
      "In his post-match press conference, the comments of Ruben Amorim stung and sparked genuine fear among the fanbase. \"We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"We don't have that fear any more and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have. It's not the players’ fault, it's my fault, I'm responsible.",
      "\"If we cannot change that really fast we should give our place to different people.\" The truth is that while everyone associated with the Reds wants a quick change of fortune at United, the rebuild will take time.",
      "It is almost impossible to contemplate United finishing in the Champions League spots by merit of their Premier League position next season. This year, they could be saved by the Europa League but that's not a guarantee in 12 months time.",
      "So if United underwhelm again and there is no sign of tangible progress, are we looking at a situation whereby Amorim departs and yet another new philosophy is integrated into the club? While the words of the Portuguese suggest that was the case less than two weeks ago, new reports surrounding Matheus Cunha suggest that is not the reality.",
      "Reporting on social media, journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed that United are close to bringing the Wolverhampton Wanderers man to the club. MEN Sport has reported that Cunha is seen as a top target for the Reds this summer alongside Ipswich Town's Liam Delap so news of progress on agreeing terms with the Brazilian shall be welcomed.",
      "However, a key detail in that report suggests that Amorim is looking to be here for the long term. Romano suggested that Cunha had 'accepted the project' at Old Trafford.",
      "While not always a guarantee, talk of projects are normally saved for discussions between the proposed signing and the manager. Considering the importance the head coach has on the direction of travel, it is almost guaranteed that it is down to Amorim to sell United to Cunha.",
      "If this is the case, which it is likely to be, there is no doubt that Amorim sees his future at the club far beyond this summer. No player worth their salt would accept a project that is little more than a year-long either.",
      "It is becoming more and more clear that Amorim's comments post-West Ham were born out of frustration for the way this season has fizzled out. He seems fully committed to the task at hand and, let's face it, it is a sizeable one."

      "The winger moved to the French club in the summer of 2024 after coming to an agreement with United to leave Manchester permanently. In January 2022, amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour, Greenwood was suspended by the Reds.",
      "Those charges were later dropped and Greenwood joined Getafe on deadline day in the summer of 2023. After his stint in Spain, the winger returned to United where, after meetings with the club, it was decided that the best course of action was to sell him permanently.",
      "A move to Marseille was swiftly agreed with United including a significant sell-on clause for their academy product which could net United millions this summer. In his first campaign in Ligue 1, Greenwood finished the season as the league's joint top goalscorer and amid rumours that he is angling for a return to the Premier League, the forward appears settled in France.",
      "\"From day one, this club welcomed me like family,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Ending the season in second and qualifying for the Champions League is something we can all be proud of.",
      "\"Being joint top scorer in Ligue 1 is a proud moment for me personally, but the real highlight was playing in front of our incredible fans week in, week out. Your support means the world.\"",
      "Pogba, Fernandes and Diogo Dalot were among the nearly 250,000 people to like the statement at the time of writing. Former United players Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Shola Shoretire also sent their messages of support to the forward in the comments section.",
      "Greenwood has previously tried to reunite with Pogba in Marseille with the midfielder currently on the hunt for a new club after agreeing a mutual exit with Juventus at the turn of the year. However, a move to the French club has not been forthcoming and the World Cup winner remains a free agent heading into the summer transfer window."

United went into the match as underdogs but the achievement of reaching the showpiece fixture was of great credit to Skinner and his team.",
      "However, a notable absentee from proceedings was Ratcliffe. He was not present in the Wembley director's box despite even members of the Glazer family being in attendance.",
      "Asked about that in his post-match press conference, Skinner explained: \"In all honesty, I don’t know why he [Ratcliffe] wasn’t here. But I feel we were well represented.",
      "\"Omar [Berrada] was here, the Glazer family, Jason [Wilcox] is up there. Those are the people I deal with everyday.",

      "\"It’s not whether you’re visible. I get you the representation, the visibility is how you see investment, but as long as I play the team are being invested in, that is also a way of showing your support for the team.\"",
      "When asked if Ratcliffe would contact him about missing the match, Skinner replied: \"I would never get that explanation, I’m here to work with the team but reality is I felt we were well supported from the club.\" The Ineos founder's absence comes in the same week that Chelsea Women gained a £20m investment from Reddit co-founder and Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian.",

      "The 2024/25 Ligue 1 season came to an end on Saturday, and for Jonathan David it marked the end of an era.",
      "After five successful years at Lille, the Canada international made his 232nd and final appearance for the club, starting their 2-1 win over Stade Reims.",
      "The striker's contract is up at the end of the season and he confirmed during the week that he will be leaving the club when it expires.",
      "In an emotional video montage he shared on his Instagram page, David said: \"I wanted you [the fans] to hear from me. After five years at the club, it is time to say goodbye.\"",
      "David was substituted with 73 minutes on the clock and received a standing ovation from Lille's supporters, who watched him score 109 goals for the club after arriving from Belgian club Gent in 2020. He was visibly emotional as he walked off the pitch, taking his time to applaud each corner of the stadium.",
      "Amid his contract situation, David has been linked with a plethora of big-name European clubs over the last few months, including Barcelona, Inter Milan, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Manchester United.",
      "United, of course, plan to sign a striker in this summer's transfer window and have earmarked Ipswich Town ace Liam Delap as their prime target. Both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to deliver the goods this season and United's need for a new goal-getter has never been greater.",
      "Delap will be available for £30million this summer via a release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich being relegated straight back to the Championship. Despite their collective struggles, Delap has scored a respectable 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League player.",
      "Earning plenty of credit for that return, the theory is that he will surpass that tally with better players around him. However, it is feared by some that he is still not experienced enough to become the starting striker at Old Trafford.",
      "Although David is only three years Delap's senior, the Canada international, who does not turn 26 until next January, has much more experience in his locker. He has played in the top tier of French football for five seasons, he has a very respectable goalscoring record in the Champions League and he has represented his country at a World Cup.",
      "David has been one of the most consistent strikers in Europe since joining Lille five years ago. Of his 109 goals for the club, 25 came this season. He also registered an impressive 12 assists this term, meaning he was directly involved in 37 goals.",
      "Of his 25 goals this season, seven came in the Champions League. He scored against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund, proving he can cut it against the continent's elite.",
      "Having done just that, David is expected to join a club that will be playing in the Champions League next season. United, despite their domestic struggles, are still in with a shot of taking a seat at European football's top table thanks to their Europa League run.",
      "United face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and a victory will see them secure qualification for next season's Champions League. That particular attraction could be game-changing when it comes to recruitment this summer.",
      "The best players all aspire to play in Europe's leading club competition and David is no exception. Alongside his tally of seven goals in the Champions League this season, he ended 2024 with 47 direct goal contributions, with only Mohamed Salah (52), Harry Kane (50) and Kylian Mbappe (49) racking up more from Europe's top five league across all competitions.",
      "Having rubbed shoulders with such leading figures, David is not going to be short of offers this summer. Where he will end up, however, remains to be seen.",
      "United would be able to offer him the guarantee of a starting berth and Champions League football if they beat Spurs. However, it is a big if.",
      "But in the event of Ruben Amorim's men coming out on top, they should at least be aspiring to present an offer to a seasoned goalscorer, who will be attainable without the need for a transfer fee.",
      "It is rare that goalscorers of David's pedigree are on the market."

      "The Brazilian ticks plenty of boxes for Ruben Amorim so it's easy to see why there is so much interest from Old Trafford to wrap up a deal. Cunha would fit perfectly into Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation alongside Bruno Fernandes as one of two No. 10s. The 25-year-old can also play as a centre-forward with his 15 Premier League goals this season offering a much greater attacking threat than United's current options in that position.",
      "And yet, the result of Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur could change everything. United's precarious PSR position would further restrict their spending if they miss out on qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Spending £60m plus for a player would eat up a huge chunk of their summer transfer budget, even if they secure a place in Europe's elite competition. If they don't, it will only shrink that tight budget further, even with the potential sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "But Wolves' reported interest in Liverpool forward Harvey Elliott may open the door for a cheaper Cunha deal. It is said that Vitor Pereira's team are looking for a new No. 10 to fill the inevitable void Cunha's exit would leave.",
      "If they do sign Elliott, Cunha would rightly point out that his team have a ready-made replacement, putting Wolves under greater pressure to sell. An opportunity could then arise for United to sign the Brazil international for a cheaper fee than his hefty release clause.",
      "Furthermore, PSR rules state that clubs’ cumulative losses over a rolling three-year period cannot exceed £105m. The Athletic report that Wolves’ have had a total loss of £127.6m over the last three years which exceeds the limit, even after the sales of Ruben Neves and Matheus Nunes in recent seasons.",
      "The report adds that Wolves have around £15m of PSR ‘headroom’ which should see them avoid a breach. However, their position has been heavily influenced by player sales - another situation which could play into United's hands.",
      "Add in the fact that Cunha appears to be extremely keen on a move to M16, and United may be able to sign a vital player for Amorim in a cut-price deal. It's a situation which the Old Trafford hierarchy will be hoping for with little room for error in a monumental summer for the club."

      "Millie Turner - Off at half-time without a massively eventful first 45. She did struggle with the pace of Aggie Beever-Jones and Mayra Ramirez at times. 5",
      "Gabby George - Beaten by Aggie Beever-Jones several times and had little to do on the ball with most of the attacking play coming from the right. Almost scored an own goal. Made up for that with a last ditch tackle to stop a shot. 4",
      "Hinata Miyazawa - Looked good when United could find her in the right spaces but that was an all-too rare occurrence. 5",
      "Grace Clinton - Cut an angry figure as she tried to lead United forward without much success. Put herself about but had to keep an eye on Lucy Bronze rather than causing her problems going the other way. 4",
      "Celin Bizet - Worked hard on the right and linked well with Miyazawa. Most of United's attacks came on her side but made a poor decision to stick her boot out in the box when conceding the penalty. 5",
      "Leah Galton - Produced a brilliant tackle to stop Mayra Ramirez from shooting at the end of the first half, which sums up how little she was able to get forward. 5",
      "Elisabeth Terland - Increasingly frustrated as she tried to deal with Millie Bright and the Chelsea trio of centre-backs. Had very little service. Headed a cross on target but couldn't add the power. Almost nicked one ahead of Hanah Hampton in a brief sight of goal. 5",
      "Substitutes:",
      "Ella Toone (On for Turner, 45') - Got one of the biggest cheers of the afternoon but otherwise did nothing. 5",
      "Melvine Malard (On for Mannion, 69') - Not on for long enough for a rating. N/A",
      "Anna Sandberg (On for George, 74') - Same as above. N/A",
      "Rachel Williams (On fo Bizet , 80') - And again. N/A",
      "Lisa Naalsund (On for Miyazawa, '80') - And again, again. N/A",
      "After finishing 16 points behind Chelsea in the WSL, United had a big gap to bride up against Chelsea. They had already improved on coming fifth place in 2023/24 under Skinner, getting six points more. They are still a way off the 2022/23 side which pushed Chelsea all the way.",
      "With much smaller investment than their opponents, how does this result shape the narrative of United's season? Well, the WSL end is maybe a slight disappointment given the final day defeat to Arsenal saw second place slip away. A run of no wins in the final four games cannot be ignored, although perhaps reaching the FA Cup final is justification enough for that.",
      "Having been beaten by Chelsea in the official title clincher, United were out for revenge but certainly went into this game as an underdog. They were edged out at the Leigh Sports Village at the end of last month by a Lucy Bronze header.",
      "This time things were less tight. United match Chelsea early and penned them in but without ever really worrying Hannah Hampton too much. They huffed and puffed but simply found themselves moved about too much by better attackers.",
      "United also lost 8-0 at home (Old Trafford this time) on the final day of last season as Chelsea lifted their fifth WSL title in a row. That was embarrassing and the record of 13 defeats at the hands of Emma Hayes/Bompastor in 15 doesn't make the picture any prettier.",
      "Fundamentally, United are better than the teams below them who are less established and carry a much smaller name. They struggle to match the giants above them who take this game seriously.",
      "The FA Cup final only went to show that as they competed without ever looking that likely to cause a shock. That feels about right for the season but is it enough with this group of players and for Skinner? The jury is still out.",
      "Despite United's strong start, Chelsea's quality started to shine through as Skinner saw his team forced back towards the edge of their own box. Although they held firm, the lack of progression from their bunkered down position started to frustrate.",
      "After a stoppage in place for an injury to Bizet, a group of United players made their way over to the touchline for some tactical instructions. It was an animated conversation, though.",
      "Grace Clinton steamed over and started to point her finger. Skinner did manage to calm her down as United took on board the details coming from their coach.",
      "Eventually some more players came over to join the huddle and mid-half team talk. It became a constructive moment in the end but United's gradual fade started to show as their attackers grew tired of chasing shadows and not getting the ball.",
      "Clinton was always up against it with Erin Cuthbert and Keira Walsh as opponents but her lack of involvement clearly started to grate."

      "Cunha would fit perfectly into Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation and it’s been widely reported that he is among Man Utd’s top targets.",
      "Speculation regarding a possible move to Man Utd has rumbled on longer than some suspected, but Romano reassured their supporters over the weekend.",
      "“Relax a bit on this one in the sense that, yes, probably there was a feeling two, three weeks ago that this deal could happen in a few days, but it always takes time to prepare a contract, to agree on the salary, to speak with the agent, then to agree with Wolves on the payment terms for the £62.5m release clause,” Romano revealed.",
      "“They need to find an agreement on the payment terms. Man Utd are working on it. Man Utd have very good connection with Cunha, with his agents. It’s a very positive conversation. Ruben Amorim appreciates Cunha, and Cunha knows that very well.",
      "“Man Utd remain very confident. Despite the rumours about other clubs – there’s always been a lot of interest in Cunha – Man Utd are the clear favourites. We expect Man Utd to advance on this one in the next days.",
      "“From what I always heard, it’s not about the Champions League football or not, winning the Europa League or not. It’s not about that. Cunha is keen on the move to United. It’s just about completing the contract agreement.”",

      "“And I think they’re going to, I don’t know about 90 minutes or, I think it could easily go to extra time.”",

      "The change in approach has been too much and the incompatibility for so many is painfully obvious. Jarrod Bowen might be good enough to thrive in any system but without even a semi-competent modern midfield everything is built on quicksand.",
      "Then West Ham’s interminable centre-forward search means that a style predicated on games being decided by the finest margins often backfires. Eight of Potter’s nine losses have been by a single goal and while he is right to point out how “in every game we’ve been competitive”, at some point that becomes an irreversible pattern of failure rather than a tantalising idea of how defeats could suddenly turn into draws or even wins if nothing actually changes.",

      "Former Man Utd and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo has received a ‘tempting’ offer to leave Al-Nassr in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ronaldo, who currently plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, won numerous trophies with Man Utd, Real Madrid and Juventus before choosing to leave Europe in 2022.",
      "The Portugal legend has scored 798 goals in 1,060 club career appearances and will go down as one of the best players to have ever lived.",
      "Ronaldo left Manchester United in controversial circumstances at the end of 2022 during his second spell at the Premier League club with Erik ten Hag allowing him to leave and join Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr.",
      "The Al-Nassr star recently declared himself the “most complete player to have existed” in an interview with friend Edu Aguirre.",
      "Ronaldo said: “I’m talking about numbers. I think I’m the most complete player to have existed. In my opinion, I think it’s me. I do everything well in football: with my head, free kicks, left foot. I’m fast, I’m strong.",
      "READ: Twelve Man City players Guardiola should upgrade after FA Cup final defeat",
      "“One thing is taste — if you like Messi, Pelé, Maradona, I understand that and I respect that — but saying Ronaldo isn’t complete … I’m the most complete. I haven’t seen anybody better than me, and I say it from the heart.”",
      "And now Spanish newspaper Marca claims that the ‘absence of achievements’ at Al-Nassr since Ronaldo joined ‘has unleashed an earthquake at the club and when that happens in a Saudi entity, changes come throughout the structure and affects the field, bench and the upper echelons.’",
      "Ronaldo ‘has received a proposal from Brazilian soccer, considered out of the market for its importance’ with his ‘discomfort’ at Al-Nassr showing in recent weeks.",
      "The report adds that ‘while the storm is raging at Al Nassr’, Ronaldo has ‘received a major offer from a Brazilian team’ and the bid ‘could turn into an out-of-market offer with significant contributions from outside investors’.",
      "MORE CRISTIANO RONALDO COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Rooney tells Man City star Haaland why he will never reach heights of Ronaldo and Messi\n👉 Ronaldo wants Al Nassr to sack manager, offload four stars as three requests for new contract surface\n👉 Ronaldo tipped to ‘sniff around’ Man Utd for investment but ‘great’ option down the leagues suggested",
      "And for the Man Utd and Real Madrid legend ‘the offer is tempting and would open up the possibility of participating in the Club World Cup’ over the summer.",
      "With Erling Haaland picking up a number of injuries over the course of the season for Man City, there are some who would want to see the Norway international rested for the Club World Cup.",
      "When asked recently if Ronaldo could be a good stand-in for Haaland, former Man Utd striker Louis Saha said: “I don’t think it makes sense. It’s a tough question. It’s painful to think of Ronaldo at City. But also, I don’t think Ronaldo needs it, it wouldn’t be worth the message it would send.",
      "“Going to Man City for what? What is this new competition? For me, I don’t respect it. This competition for me is absolutely unnecessary. Almost like something strange based on the fight that they had with the Super League. I just don’t understand it.",
      "“Going there for Cristiano doesn’t make sense for me because the competition is not worth it.”",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has been told by Wayne Rooney why he and Kylian Mbappe will never reach the heights of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly made three remarkable demands to Al Nassr during talks over a new contract.",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Football finance expert Dr Rob Wilson has suggested Cristiano Ronaldo could “sniff around” Manchester United, but he suggested Cheltenham would be a “great” option.",
      "Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has been backed to join arch-rivals Manchester City in a potential shock transfer.",
      "Only eight players in history have scored more Champions League knockout stage goals than Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, which really is daft."

      "",
      "CENTRE-BACK: James Tarkowski (Everton)\nEverton have conceded fewer goals than Newcastle this season and a key reason is Tarkowski, who tackles more than any other centre-half and also ranks highly for blocks, clearances and interceptions. He is a busy boy. Though he should absolutely have been sent off v Liverpool.",

      "LEFT-BACK: Antonee Robinson (Fulham)\nTen Premier League assists are what catches the eye, but he is also defensively sound. Seems to have been usurped by the much younger Milos Kerkez in terms of being a target for clubs in Europe; has he missed the boat?",

      "CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nProbably Arsenal’s player of the season, his fourth Premier League goal of the season came in the win over Newcastle, while he also has seven assists. A genuine all-rounder, he pushes out Liverpool’s Alexis Mac Allister here.",
      "",
      "RIGHT WING: Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Premier League’s best ever winger? The stats would suggest so. And this season he has scored 28 goals and claimed 18 assists, adding another goal v Tottenham. He is nailed on for the PFA Player of the Year award.",
      "",
      "ATTACKING MIDFIELD: Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCole Palmer has been dislodged from this Premier League XI by Cunha, who now has 15 goals and six assists as a) Wolves have pulled away from the relegation zone and b) the Brazilian has made himself one of the hottest properties of the summer.",
      "Surely even Manchester United cannot cock this one up…",

      "The first declared the need for open heart surgery, whose advice was roundly ignored. The second identified a number of problem players and was busy moving them out and replacing parts in flight, while also dealing with the clusterf*** above him that continued to overpay for players and fail to get rid of others.",

      "2. Arsenal’s CL run. Regardless of your opinions of Arteta, it seems strange to criticise him for getting a team to compete and be utter hard nutters when previously they were castigated for being too soft. You can dislike him and give him credit for being a decent manager too…! Those Declan Rice free kicks against Real will live long in the memory.",
      "3. Mo Salah being utterly brilliant. I remember watching the 3-6 against Spurs at Xmas and saying ‘Salah’s not done a lot here; Spence has dealt with him quite well.’ I still think the second part of the statement could be true, but he ended up with two goals and two assists, so what do I know?",
      "4. Manchester United being a bit pants. As someone born in the eighties and grew up in the nineties, I had to watch quite a few red Premier League lifts. To see them languishing towards the bottom of the league is a bit mad yet they could still put a trophy in the cabinet…it’s a bit bonkers.",
      "5. Bournemouth being boss for a period. Iraola has got that side playing some wonderful football and although they’ve dropped off slightly towards the end, no one expected them to be competing for European spots deep into the season. A big summer ahead could lead to real excitement next year.",
      "6. Nottingham Forest going mental. Although you can hang your hat on Nuno’s formation changes and when he’ll do them, I’m not sure anyone expected them to be this good, nor Chris Wood turn into prime original Ronaldo. I really hope they take one of the remaining European spots this Sunday. Ideally at the expense of….",
      "7. Club 130 charges. Winning nothing. As the yoot say, ‘you love to see it’.",
      "8. PSG looking like an actual team. The speed of the passing and transitions through midfield against the three English sides in the knockout phase was an absolute joy to watch at times. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job; plus with all his charity work with child loss awareness really seems like one of the good guys (shout out to Lee here; hope you’re holding up, mate).",

      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",
      "",
      "",
      "4) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.2% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, leaving him level with David Raya for the Golden Gloves award.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "12) David Raya (Arsenal): +0.9\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.1\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -1.8\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",

The one who has lost a hundred times and gets the redemption of one moment when all his efforts are rewarded.",

      "Here’s every current Premier League manager ranked by how much they moan – from the zen monks to the ticking time bombs.",
      "",
      "20) Simon Rusk (Southampton)\nTriggered Ruben Dias and for that, not a single bad word will be said about Southampton’s interim manager.",
      "",
      "19) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nHe seems nice, doesn’t he? Glasner gives off the vibe that he doesn’t have a care in the world as long as the powers above just leave him to coach in peace.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle United)\nIt’s rare to see Howe lose his cool. He’s just a chill guy. And for that, we can’t praise him enough. Managing in the Premier League is a chastening experience, yet Howe makes it look like a walk in the park.",
      "That said, he’s not above the odd moan – but more often than not, he takes his medicine and moves on. A true modern-day stoic.",
      "",
      "17) Kieran McKenna (Ipswich Town)\nWe’re not ashamed to admit we’re not entirely sure if McKenna is a moaner or not, which probably means he’s not. Calm, composed and too well-raised to throw shade at referees. We suspect he apologises to fourth officials for blocking their view.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nThree-time Europa League winner Unai Emery is an animated manager, but not overly moany. He’s actually polite and respectful in interviews — and used to be mocked for it.",
      "",
      "15) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nUnited boss Amorim is more prone to self-loathing than anything else. If he moans, it’s about himself or his players being rubbish. It’s a refreshing change from his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, who would rather die than admit fault and still believes Alejandro Garnacho was onside because VAR used the “wrong angle”.",
      "Amorim may yet explode – it’s United, after all – but for now, his grievances are existential.",
      "",
      "14) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nPotter is a man slowly being lured to the dark side by the soul-sapping grind of managing West Ham United. And we can’t blame him. Reporters beware: he might still be polite, but he can swear if you want him to.",
      "",
      "13) Ruud van Nistelrooy (Leicester City)\nThere have been whispers of discontent – complaints about Caleb Okori’s boots, frustrations with players’ living arrangements and public criticism – but overall, Van Nistelrooy has kept a lid on things. He’s moaned, yes, but with humility. Leicester’s chaos hasn’t exactly helped.",
      "",
      "12) Pep Guardiola (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola is in a camp of his own as a very knowing, quite weird and extremely funny manager. He is unintentionally hilarious and we wouldn’t have it any other way.",
      "",
      "11) Thomas Frank (Brentford)\nWhen things don’t go his way, Thomas Frank is well accustomed to throwing his toys out of the pram. Generally, though, he’s pretty reserved and honest, and tends to give compelling answers in both pre- and post-match press conferences.",
      "",
      "10) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nIt’s been plain sailing for Slot in year one, but when the mask did slip – against Everton – it was spectacular. Even in defeat to PSG, he was almost serene. But four yellow cards suggest something’s simmering under the surface. Next season, we’ll see the real him.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nThere’s no hard evidence – but Pereira feels like a moaner. This season has gone well for him, which helps. But if Wolves had VAR go against them in a key game, you just know he’d throw the fourth official’s board into the stands.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nMaresca recently complained about the St James’ Park atmosphere influencing the referee, as if Nicolas Jackson hadn’t just elbowed Sven Botman in the head. Pick your battles, Enzo.",
      "His comments may have been more about the decisions that followed, and Maresca comes across more as a disciplinarian and standard-setter than a simple moaner.",
      "",
      "7) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nGet this man going, and it’s hard to stop him. Forest’s incredible season means Nuno hasn’t had much to complain about, but we all know he has it in him.",
      "",
      "6) David Moyes (Everton)\nMoyes might be more reserved and calm now he’s back at Everton, but there’s no doubt he still loves a good moan. It’s not always reporters who get the brunt of his frustration — sometimes it’s poor German ball boys. Nobody is safe when he’s in the mood.",
      "",
      "5) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nThe youngest boss in the league found himself in Arsenal’s crosshairs after claiming Declan Rice’s red card early in the season was fair and saying Joao Pedro booting the ball away was irrelevant. Arsenal fans noticed – and pounced.",
      "Hurzeler’s comments ensured the Gunners sleuths were ready to swarm at the first hint of hypocrisy. And they did just that. Their obsessive nature has kept the German’s moaning firmly in the social media spotlight — helping to propel him up this ranking.",
      "",
      "4) Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)\nBig Ange is ranked high, mainly because he despises Spurs fans and hates having to be Spurs manager. That results in a lot of moans, groans and passive-aggressive monologues in press conferences. His inconsistencies are part of the charm, though – ‘everyone’s human, mate’ becomes ‘the whole system is broken’ within a week.",
      "He’ll be gone soon. We’ll miss him.",
      "",
      "3) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nNo Premier League manager has received more yellow cards this season than Andoni Iraola, with his most recent caution coming on February 1 against Liverpool. He’s learning. Slowly.",
      "The Basque boss wears his heart on his sleeve and isn’t shy about speaking his mind — even when Bournemouth win.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nWe are now into the category of top-tier moaners. In second place is Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta — who many would have top, and we wouldn’t blame them.",
      "Clearly a tremendous manager and, by most accounts, a nice guy, Arteta has still managed to rub a lot of people up the wrong way. He’s widely disliked for his animated touchline behaviour, which often crosses the line — both literally and figuratively.",
      "The Spaniard’s infamous ‘desgracia’ rant after losing to Newcastle in November 2023 will go down as one of the greatest post-match headlosses in Premier League history.",
      "Say what you like about him, but the Premier League would be a duller place without Arteta.",
      "",
      "1) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nHere he is. The moaniest manager in the land.",
      "He’s been fined, racked up yellow cards, and delivered more fury than any manager outside the top six. And because he’s Fulham manager, it mostly goes under the radar. Not anymore.",
      "Oh, and Silva has a tell when he’s agitated: he fixes that beautiful hair of his. And he does that a lot.",
      "READ NEXT: Arteta should quit if he can’t show respect and Newcastle v Chelsea coverage shows sportswashing works"

      "Man Utd lost their 18th league game of the season in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea; Roy Keane thinks defeat in the Europa League final would destroy the club's pulling power; Keane: \"I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Man Utd. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club\"",
      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 07:41, UK",
      "Chelsea held their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification as Marc Cucurella’s second-half header secured a 1-0 win over Manchester United to send them fourth.",
      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Chelsea: Sanchez (7), James (8), Tosin (7), Colwill (8), Cucurella (8), Caicedo (8), Enzo (7), Palmer (7), Madueke (6), George (6), Neto (6).\n\n\nUsed subs:  Gusto (6), Lavia (6).\n\n\nMan Utd Onana (6), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Shaw (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (5), Amad (6), Mount (6), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nUsed subs: Garnacho (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Moises Caicedo.",
      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and can push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "\"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving.",
      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",

      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
