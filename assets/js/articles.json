      "We're approaching the final month of the summer transfer window and Manchester United still have plenty of work to do. The Red Devils got off to a lightning-fast start by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves on the first day of the window, triggering his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's arrival, however, was much more complicated and Ruben Amorim had to be patient. Weeks of fraught negotiations with Brentford culminated in United agreeing to pay up to £71m for him last Monday.",
      "That takes the Red Devils' spending to £133.5m, a hefty sum in isolation but far behind the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal. United don't have an unlimited budget, though.",
      "They're reliant on sales, with four members of Amorim's bomb squad - Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - still at the club. But that hasn't stopped United from working on deals.",
      "They're not just focussed on attack, as at the other end, Amorim wants competition from Andre Onana. Royal Antwerp prospect Senne Lammens has been linked but now there's chance to sign one of the world's best.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly been made available by Paris Saint-Germain, who've agreed a £34m deal for Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. Therefore, if United were able to make the finances work, they could offer the Italian - whose contract in Paris expires next summer - a move to the Premier League.",
      "Donnarumma would play behind a three-man defence, something which he's used to at international level. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and the currently injured Lisandro Martinez are likely to be Amorim's preferred defensive trio.",
      "The wing-back positions are crucial for the Red Devils boss and it'll be a battle between Amad, Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui on the right. As for the left-hand side, January signing Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and teenager Diego Leon will compete.",
      "Where would Manchester United finish with this XI? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, who snubbed a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, is likely to move into a deeper role as a result of United's forward-heavy recruitment. Casemiro would be a stable partner for the big occasions but Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo each offer something different.",
      "Up front, it takes no working out. Should the Red Devils land Watkins, he'll reunite with former Brentford team-mate Mbeumo and play alongside Cunha in a Premier League-proven trident.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "One week into life at Manchester United, and it seems as though Bryan Mbeumo's eyes have been opened. The £65million signing from Brentford signed just in time to join his new club on their pre-season tour of the United States, but it hasn't all been easy.",
      "In fact, the winger has indicated that working under Ruben Amorim has been a significant step up in intensity. At least that was the impression United great Rio Ferdinand was under after recently bumping into the Cameroon international.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, was always liable to raise his standards in different areas after joining one of the biggest clubs in the world this summer. However, Ferdinand revealed the details of their recent catch-up stateside, where Mbeumo appeared somewhat taken aback following his first week of training under Amorim.",
      "\"My man turned around and went, 'My God. Wow,'\" said the Old Trafford icon on Rio Ferdinand Presents after he asked Mbeumo off-camera about the training so far this summer. \"'Like an athletics club, man. It's hard. It's really hard.'",
      "\"So don't ever let the fact these guys are going out and having down time make you think that these guys ain't working. They're working.\"",
      "That second comment was presumably in reference to some fans taking umbrage with United players putting their feet up at times in pre-season. However, six-time Premier League champion Ferdinand agreed it's important for squad members to strike a balance and be allowed to live normal lives amid the pressure of their on-field careers.",
      "It's a testament to the standards Amorim is demanding of his players during his first summer at the United helm. The former Sporting CP boss took over the Red Devils in November 2024 and will look to this summer as vital preparation to improve on a largely disappointing first term at the helm.",
      "It was back in January that Amorim referred to his United squad as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club after a 3-1 loss to Brighton. And despite reaching the Europa League final, where they lost to Tottenham, an all-time low finish of 15th in the Premier League would appear to confirm his appraisal.",
      "As well as Mbeumo, United also broke the bank to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal. And just as Mbeumo has given the lowdown on what life is like under his new manager, Amorim has returned the favour by assessing the differences between his two new major arrivals.",
      "\"[Cunha is] a top player, can play in different positions,\" said the United boss before their recent 2-1 friendly win over West Ham. \"He’s really loud in the dressing room. He’s Brazilian. So I love that on him.",
      "\"He’s completely different from Bryan. Bryan is the opposite. So it’s really fun to combine all the characters and the talent in the club.\"",
      "Cunha made his second United appearance in the win over Graham Potter's men. However, fans are still waiting to get their first glimpse of Mbeumo in club colours, which may come in the Premier League Summer Series showdown against Everton on August 3.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Bruno Fernandes for rejecting the eye-watering sums on offer from the Saudi Pro League – whilst also questioning whether the star is \"mad\" for turning it down. The Manchester United captain was the subject of a failed approach from Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal earlier this summer.",
      "Reports claimed that the club were armed with a £300million package to secure the star, with £100m heading to United and a remarkable £200m contract awaiting Fernandes himself.",
      "Ferdinand, whilst commending the Portuguese midfielder for his loyalty to United, couldn't resist sharing his amazement at the 30-year-old spurning the Saudi club's fortunes.",
      "When quizzed about what he would do when faced with such riches on his podcast, Rio Presents, the former United defender said: \"I'm gone,\" prompting laughter from podcast colleagues Stephen Howson and Flex.",
      "Ferdinand then explained: \"If I'm 25, I'm not [heading to Saudi Arabia]. Don't forget, in our era, China was about – I wouldn't have gone.\"",
      "Discussing the contrast between the appeal of the Saudi Pro League compared to the former influence once wielded by the Chinese Super League, he added: \"In money terms, back then it [Chinese Super League] was [as persuasive as Saudi Arabia]. It's not in terms of location, but it wouldn't have even turned my head going [to] China.",
      "\"But I'm sitting here now, my career is finished, and you look at things differently, and you're turning away £50m a year – I'm offski bruv, get me a lifejacket and I'm swimming there,\" he joked.",
      "When asked about his opinion on Fernades for rejecting the lucrative offer, Ferdinand responded: \"I rate him, but are you mad?",
      "\"I respect it so much and the fans will love him more. He's looking at legacy. We know that this guy [Fernandes] is now about legacy [and not the money].\"",
      "Earlier in the summer, Ferdinand reiterated his sentiments, stating he would have understood if Fernandes had chosen to leave United.",
      "During a press conference for his national team in early June, Fernandes disclosed that he rejected Al-Hilal's incredible offer after discussions with United manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"It would have been easy to move there [Al Hilal]. I know the Portuguese players there very well,\" he admitted. \"But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles. I can do that, and I still want to. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.\"",
      "Following United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, Fernandes was candid about his future with the club. He stated that he would leave the decision regarding his future to United officials, with the club considering selling several of their star players this summer after a disappointing season.",
      "The 30 year old has been a key player for United, scoring 98 goals and providing 87 assists in 290 matches across all competitions since his transfer from Sporting CP in January 2020.",

      "Aston Villa may be simply regurgitating a tactic already deployed by Liverpool this summer in insisting that Ollie Watkins is not for sale despite Manchester United's interest. While Ruben Amorim has secured the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, it is clear that the Portuguese hopes to recruit a proven No. 9 ahead of the new campaign.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with a move for Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres earlier in the window, only for the Swede to commit his future to Arsenal in a £63.7million deal. As a result, United are now said to be pondering the possibility of signing Watkins ahead of the new season.",
      "However, it appears as though United have hit a stumbling block in their ambitions of signing the 29-year-old; the Villans have explained that he isn't for sale. Villa sources insist that Watkins will stay put this summer, although the club did value him at £60m in January when Arsenal showed their own interest, before backtracking when Jhon Duran left to join Al-Nassr.",
      "Whether Villa are serious in retaining Watkins, or if they are deploying mind-games to drive his price up, is up for debate at present, given that United are said to be unwilling to meet their previous £60m price tag and are looking at a more budget-friendly range of between £40m and £45m.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time that such a tactic has been deployed this summer, with Liverpool stating Luis Diaz would remain at Anfield before changing their tune completely. Barcelona expressed an interest in the Colombian last month and even reportedly entered a bid which was quickly rebuffed by the Reds.",
      "Bayern Munich director of sport, Max Eberl, was reportedly told that Liverpool would not enter discussions over Diaz when the Bavarian's made their own approach earlier this summer. Regardless, Bayern submitted an offer of £58.5m for the winger which was quickly turned down, only to return with an improved sum of £65.5m which has since been accepted.",
      "Bayern manager Vincent Kompany is said to have spoken with Diaz in a recent video call, where he outlined his plans for the 28-year-old in the Bundesliga. Diaz landed in Germany for a medical on Tuesday and is expected to be announced as Bayern's latest signing imminently.",
      "With 16 goals and eight assists to his name in the Premier League last season, Villa may be simply playing hard-ball to get a better price for their star striker who has three years remaining on his current deal. However, there is also genuine concern that Villa don't have enough depth up top to let Watkins leave, given that he is the only genuine No. 9 on Villa's books at present.",
      "Should Manchester United be unsuccessful in their endeavours to sign Watkins and take Villa's word as gospel, then they're not exactly short in terms of other options. The Red Devils are thought to be the front-runners in the race to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, despite Newcastle United also showing a heavy interest considering Alexander Isak's wishes to explore a move away from St James' Park.",
      "Leipzig reportedly value the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season, at around £60m. Meanwhile, it is reported that United have also explored deals for PSG's Randal Kolo Muani and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wrexham have been told to prioritise the pursuit of two former England stars over Christian Eriksen. It was revealed last week that the Welsh side had made a sensational approach for the Danish midfielder following his departure from Manchester United.",
      "The 33-year-old is currently a free agent after leaving the Premier League giants in May. Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoots told the Daily Mail that Wrexham – owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney – was a \"hugely impressive project\".",
      "However, the ex-Tottenham and Ajax player rejected the newly-promoted Championship outfit's advances. It came after Eriksen was said to have expressed his eagerness to remain at the top level for as long as possible.",
      "Former Blackburn striker Matt Jansen has now encouraged the Red Dragons to chase either Leicester legend Jamie Vardy or ex-Newcastle forward Callum Wilson instead. Jansen, who also had a short spell at Wrexham towards the end of his career, said the duo would be better options for his old club as manager Phil Parkinson looks to bolster his squad.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, he said: \"I think all the way through the spine of the team, they need to strengthen. Then it's a case of having a good run. If they have that, with confidence and belief, it would push them to the top of the table.",
      "\"I would say they have a good four or five players to get, top class players, proven goalscorers, to get to the top level of the Championship.",
      "\"Most importantly for them is a goalscorer and you'd be looking at the likes of a Jamie Vardy or a Callum Wilson, free agents at the moment. I think they would both be a better signing than Eriksen.\"",
      "Parkinson has admitted this week that Wrexham did try and sign Eriksen early in the summer transfer window. But he said the talks did not extend further than an initial conversation.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" Parkinson told BBC Sport Wales on Monday. \"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham have made six new signings so far this summer, including striker Ryan Hardie, goalkeeper Danny Ward, defender Liberato Cacace, midfielders George Thomason and Lewis O'Brien and forward Josh Windass.",
      "The club is preparing for its first season in the second tier in 43 years and Parkinson said he was aiming to make further additions before their opening game at Southampton on August 9.",
      "He added: \"We've been linked with so many players and if we'd been speaking to every player we've been linked with, I don't think we'd have had an hour to sleep over the last month. Some are true, some aren't.",
      "\"But we're just going about our business and trying to get a squad which can represent the club in this division this season.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "Aston Villa privately insist Watkins isn't for sale at any price but United believe that a deal could be done for between £40million and £45m. That'd be considerably less than the £71m which Ruben Amorim's side agreed to pay Brentford for Mbeumo earlier this month.",
      "\"Said would be Roberto Firmino, very attacking, a good finisher,\" Mbeumo explained. \"I think it would be hard to say who is who among Mo Salah and Sadio Mane but I would probably be Mane and Ollie would be Salah.\"",
      "Watkins was flattered by the comparisons, saying: \"They are unbelievable, some of the best in the world and it's nice to always be compared to players of that stature. But I feel like we are compared to any front three that score a lot of goals. \"",
      "That summer, Brentford sold Watkins to Villa in a deal worth up to £33m and he's gone on to score 87 goals across five seasons. The England international's proven track record in the Premier League has seen him rise to the top of United's shortlist.",
      "The Red Devils have alternatives, though, including Benjamin Sesko and Randal Kolo Muani.

      "\"Champions League, we've put in a lot of hard graft in the last few years to get to that position. I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games, so I'm not going to lie – I was fuming I wasn't playing,\" Watkins said after the second leg.",

Injuries have wrecked Mount's first two seasons at United, following his £60million move from Chelsea, with the 26-year-old managing just 11 starts last term.",

      "“He said to me there's no guarantees, even though you played for me. But it gives you more, you want to push even more, to be able to be back in the squad. So it was really good to speak to him. He looked very excited.",
      "“As a player, you always want to play for your country and that's such a big honour, to play for your country. Any opportunity that you get to put that shirt on is amazing. I've had 36 caps for England, so I know what it means to be able to play for your country. I'd love to have that opportunity again, but I'm focusing on club football first.",
      "“We need to put right what happened last season. So I'm looking at that first for sure and then we'll see what happens at the end of the season.”",
      "On his personal aims for the upcoming season, Mount said: “I think it's about kicking on from where I was last season. Putting that behind me, the injuries and stuff, and looking forward to what I can do. Focusing on what I bring to the team and knowing what I can do.”",

      "Manchester United’s hopes of landing Morten Hjulmand may have been helped by Viktor Gyokeres’ move to Arsenal. United have been strongly linked with the Swedish striker, who played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP, before his transfer to Arsenal.",
      "The Red Devils are keen on another Sporting player, midfielder Hjulmand, who is also wanted by Juventus, according to reports in Italy. However, rather than an outright purchase, the Turin giants are ready to offer Douglas Luiz as part of a swap deal, with Juve paying an additional fee, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "However, that plan is set to be complicated by Luiz’s wages, believed to be worth around £4.3million a year, which are well beyond Sporting’s current wage structure. O Jogo reports that this will make any potential swap deal virtually impossible to complete, though Juventus could still try their luck.",
      "Having lost Gyokeres, Sporting chiefs would be loath to lose another of their prized assets. And after agreeing a deal worth up to £64m for Gyokeres, Sporting are under no pressure to sell and can afford to hold out for Hjulmand’s £70million release clause if they wish.",
      "This, in turn, could prevent United's rivals, who are better positioned than the Red Devils, from snapping up the midfielder under their noses.",
      "Having already splurged £133.5m this summer – and with RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko high on their list of targets – it remains to be seen whether United will land Hjulmand this summer with Ruben Amorim prioritising a striker.",
      "However, given Juve’s apparent difficulties in financing a deal and Gyokeres bolstering Sporting's coffers, United can afford to bide their time and potentially wait for a future transfer window.",
      "United are currently looking to offload a number of wantaway stars to help fund the much-needed revamp of Amorim’s squad. However, the head coach has warned that players won't be allowed to leave on the cheap and says they could still have futures at the clubs.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were left out of the tour of the United States and have been training at Carrington instead.",
      "United’s recent transfer dealings have been widely criticised but Amorim said chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Jason Wilcox would not be taken advantage of.",
      "“I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that,” said the United boss.",
      "“I understand clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise and I’m ready. I’m ready to receive the players.”",

      "Manchester United failed to sign Adrien Rabiot three years ago after making a “very disrespectful” demand. That is according to Rabiot’s mother Véronique, who acts as his agent and was responsible for walking away from the negotiating table in 2022.",
      "Back then, United had agreed an initial £15million fee to sign the France international from Juventus. But the transfer stalled and eventually collapsed amid reports that Rabiot’s wage demands were the issue.",
      "Erik ten Hag wanted to clinch a deal for the central midfielder, but United’s lack of Champions League football was a sticking point. Rabiot was leaving Juve, who played in Europe’s best club competition, for United, who were gearing up for a campaign in the Europa League after finishing sixth the season before.",
      "The then-27-year-old and Véronique were accused in the media of being greedy and blamed for the move collapsing. He ended up staying with Juve for another two years before joining Marseille last summer on a free transfer and Véronique has now pushed back against the narrative over the failed United move in an interview with L’Equipe.",
      "“That, too, is completely false,” she said of the allegations of greed over wage demands. “That year, Adrien was ready to leave Juve, who had qualified for the Champions League, for Manchester United, who hadn’t.",
      "“We discussed the terms, and in the end, they said to me: ‘If we don’t qualify for the Champions League at the end of next season, Adrien’s salary will go down.’ I found that really over the top and very disrespectful.”",
      "“I said, ‘We’re stopping’. They thought it was a strategy to get more [money]. But no, it was a matter of principle, not money. Obviously, it surprised them. They’re not used to it.”",
      "Reports at the time said Rabiot was asking for a wage increase from €7m (£6m) per season to €10m (£8.6m). That would have put him squarely in the middle of United’s wage structure at the time, well below top-earners Cristiano Ronaldo, David de Gea and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Véronique was slammed in September by French agent Bruno Satin after she oversaw Rabiot’s move to Marseille, instead of to Atletico Madrid. “It’s the result of the incompetence of the people who accompanied him there,” Satin told RMC Sport.",
      "“He is advised by his mother and it shows that it is good to be accompanied by professionals because if he had been accompanied by a pro, he would be in a European top ten club and what’s more, he was free.",
      "“The first thing is to get his opinion and find out what he wants to do. But it would be more interesting to ask him at the end of May because now [at the end of August], he has done the rounds of the market.",
      "“To take a concrete example, I had the sporting director of Atletico Madrid at the end of July and he told me: ‘I had two conversations with the mother and I stopped immediately because she explained to me where her son should play’. It quickly tires all the professionals, it’s unbearable.”",

      "United have already brought in £133.5million worth of attacking talent; Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo, deals which showcase their focus on signing players with a proven track record in the Premier League.",
      "It comes after a move for Jackson, 24, was ruled out by United chiefs, according to the Athletic. It was previously claimed that Chelsea would demand between £80m and £100m for the Senegal international, who's dropped down at the pecking order at Stamford Bridge after the Blues paid £60m and £30m respectively for Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "United are now stepping up their pursuit of Watkins, who Villa privately insist isn't for sale at any price. But there's a belief at Old Trafford that a deal can be done for the 29-year-old.",
      "Although the Red Devils are reluctant to match the £60m which Arsenal bid for Watkins in January, they're hoping to find an agreement in the £40m to £45m range. Newcastle have also been linked with the Villa star, as they brace to receive a bid from Liverpool for Isak.",
      "United are looking to reunite Watkins with Mbeumo, as the pair scored 40 Championship goals between them in the 2019-20 season for Brentford. But should Villa dig their heels in, Amorim's side could look to Sesko.",
      "United's interest in the Slovenian dates back to when he was 16 and they've looked at signing him on a further two occasions. When Sesko put pen to paper his new five-year contract contract in 2024, there was a gentlemen's agreement that should an elite club - by the player's definition - offer between £69m to £78m, Leipzig would sanction his departure.",
      "Should they turn to Sesko, United have a secret weapon who could help negotiations run smoothly. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell worked in executive roles at Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig in 2019 and 2022, the years in which Sesko signed for both clubs.",

      "Paul Scholes suggested Ralph Hasenhuttl for the Manchester United job three years ago following the departure of Ralf Rangnick, but Ryan Bertrand was far from pleased by his management style at Southampton.",
      "Rangnick was appointed interim Red Devils manager in November 2021 in the wake of the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, he only lasted until the end of the season following a dismal campaign at Old Trafford which culminated in a sixth-place finish with an at the time club-record low of 58 points.",
      "Despite a four-year career with the Saints culminating in a 2021/22 relegation battle before his dismissal, Scholes saw Hasenhuttl as the perfect fit for United given his style of play. Speaking to BT Sport in 2022, Scholes said: \"I've always liked the football he plays at Southampton with not the best squad.",
      "\"The type of football has worked for them. His teams have been good to watch; I think it comes across really well. I think people around this club, and fans especially, are thinking more of possibly [Mauricio] Pochettino or an Antonio Conte and what people have been at the bigger clubs.",
      "\"The more I think about it, I don't think [going for Hasenhuttl] would be a bad thing. The way he goes about his business, he looks good.\"",
      "United ultimately appointed Erik ten Hag as new head coach ahead of 2022/23, with Hasenhuttl enduring a two-year lay-off before taking up tenure with VfL Wolfsburg in 2024. While Scholes saw the 57-year-old as an ideal fit for the club that the former midfielder still holds close to home, Bertrand's first opinions of Hasenhuttl were far from stellar.",
      "The now retired left-back spent six years at St Mary's, making 240 appearances before parting ways for Leicester City in 2021. And while he played under Hasenhuttl for the final three years of his tenure in Southampton, the 35-year-old didn't see eye-to-eye with him as he took up tenure.",
      "Speaking on the Business of Sport podcast, Bertrand said: \"To be honest, I have a lot of respect for him, and I actually really like him. He's a really good guy, but at the start when he come in, he come in fully egotistical.",
      "\"Thinking anyone 30-plus or 28-plus is like the enemy cause they can't learn new things. It's his way or the highway, everyone needs to listen, there's no talking back. And it was like, 'You need feedback, cause I've been with a lot of managers that have done a little bit more than what you do and they listen to people, and this is how you survive in the Premier League.'",
      "\"But I think he sensed that and he was so paranoid of other people perhaps making him look like he's not the number one. Confusing feedback for talking back, he was so authoritarian approach. This way, that way.\"",
      "Bertrand also recalled how his reaction to one game in particular also caused friction between himself and Hasenhuttl, claiming that he saw himself demoted from the starting XI and phased out in favour of players who weren't even natural left-backs.",
      "Bertrand explained how the Saints were losing a game and he was substituted off in the dying moments despite being an attacking full-back and the team in need of a goal, a move which baffled him.",
      "But when he approached Hasenhuttl to ask on his theory behind the substitution, he claims that the manager became defensive before freezing him out. He added: \"He was a bit hostile and was like,' You know, it was just a decision that I made,' and I was like, 'Alright, no problem.'",
      "\"And I left the room, and then after that we just never spoke. He was playing people like Moussa Djenepo, he was playing him left-back. He was playing Kevin Danso left-back...like centre-backs left-back, wingers left-back, anything to kind of provoke a reaction out of me.",
      "\"But I wouldn't because I want to win. It's fine, if you want to play that it's no problem. I'll just train every day and didn't kind of say nothing.\"",
      "Bertrand then spoke to a director at Southampton to ask what was Hasenhuttl's issue, only to be told that the manager wasn't happy with the substitution incident. However, Bertrand claimed that towards the end of his tenure at St Mary's, that Hasenhuttl turned things around and changed his approach to football management, actively engaging with players more and coming across more friendly.",
      "He explained: \"Towards the end he went full circle. And he slowly, slowly... he ended up going 360. Ended up being more personable, talking to everyone, trying to be people's best mate, had more of a character. And I just thought, 'You weren't worth my time,' because that moment at the start, he was very disrespectful.\"",
      "He added: \"From the early days of respect was a one way street with him, and then coming back and then killing my game, and then needed me to stay. Why would I stay?\"",
      "Bertrand made the move to Leicester City in a free transfer in 2021, making just 11 appearances for the Foxes before announcing his retirement from football in June 2024.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was once hailed as a better player than Manchester City's Erling Haaland by a coach who has worked with both stars. Manchester United's search for a new striker looks to have led them to Red Bull Leipzig's star forward, Sesko, although they haven't ruled out a move for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko, 22, boasts an impressive record of 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has caught the eye of several top-flight English clubs. United are now poised to make their move for the much-admired striker, but face a battle for his signature with Newcastle.",
      "Former Red Bull Salzburg coach Rene Aufhauser once shared his belief that Sesko could even surpass Haaland in terms of potential. Haaland, now 25, had a stint at Salzburg from 2019 to 2020, while Sesko played for the Austrian side between 2020-2023.",
      "\"Benjamin is maybe the better football player, better to play with the team, technically maybe better at the same age,\" Rene Aufhauser said to The Mail in 2022, when Sesko was just 19. \"His natural movements are so good, he's 6ft 4in tall, fast and has very, very good physical ability.",
      "\"He's so smooth with the ball, very good technique, good finishing and he jumps so high. Very, very, good with the head. It's unbelievable.",
      "\"Erling [Haaland] was mentally a monster and (mentally) better at the same age,\" Aufhauser continued. \"This is the last five, 10 per cent that Benji has to get.\"",
      "While Sesko is younger, it's true that by 22 - the Slovenian's current age - Haaland had already scored his big-money move to City, where he won the Premier League in his maiden season with the Citizens. He has consistently been the league's most feared frontman since teaming up with Pep Guardiola, winning two top-flight titles and the Champions League.",
      "Sesko actually turned down United three years ago in favour of a move to Leipzig but is now eager to secure a high-profile transfer this summer. The Slovenian is contracted to Leipzig until 2029, but his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept the lines of communication open since United's initial approach and even visited their Carrington training complex.",
      "So, if United do make a play for Sesko, does he have what it takes to succeed in the Premier League? Aufhauser felt that the three-time Slovenian Youth Footballer of the Year still had some way to go before he could be considered the complete package.",
      "\"He needs experience at this level and also maybe to learn to handle and deal with disappointment,\" he said in 2022. \"Sometimes he wants to be perfect. He has to stay cool, stay calm and to wait for his next chance. This is maybe the biggest thing he has to learn.\"",
      "Fast forward three years, armed with three Austrian Bundesliga titles and a goalscoring tally that would make many of Europe's top strikers envious, it seems Sesko might just be poised to take the leap to United – potentially challenging Haaland as one of England's most fearsome forwards.",

      "Sancho was at Chelsea last term and prior to that had a short loan stint at Dortmund, the club where he first made his name. The Daily Mail now reports that a third spell at the German club could be on the cards.",
      "United signed Sancho for just over £70million but he's been unable to deliver on that fee. As a result they're willing to sell up and a move to either Juventus or Dortmund is being talked up.",
      "The Manchester outfit would accept between £15m and £17m, which represents a mammoth loss. However that figure is necessary to tempt potential buyers given that neither Juventus or Dortmund have the finances to break the bank to land Sancho.",
      "United had a deal in place with Chelsea to make Sancho’s loan a permanent deal, worth up to £25m, at the end of last season, but the Londoners chose to pay a £5m penalty to rip up the agreement. The England international is also entering the final year of his contract.",
      "He currently earns £275,000-a-week, a figure he would need to take a massive cut on, and his decline since moving to Manchester has seen him fall out of the picture with the Three Lions. It was at Dortmund that he was first capped by his country.",
      "Last summer when the German club reached the Champions League final, with Sancho playing a key role, there was talk of a permanent switch but club chief Sebastian Kehl admitted that finances were an issue. “In the end, it will take money (to sign Sancho). A lot of money. Definitely more than we have at the moment, that’s clear,\" he said at the time.",
      "As well as Sancho United have the likes of Antony and Alejandro Garnacho at the club, but they are trying to shift them in the coming weeks. Amorim has maintained the club have their valuations and opened the door to them being reintegrated into the squad if they do remain.",

      "Sesko, who is valued at £64million, is set to move on after Leipzig missed out on Champions League football. United will be absent from European football completely this season following a torrid 2024/25 campaign, which culminated in a 1-0 loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "After that game, Shearer ripped into Ruben Amorim and his team, blasting their tactics and the club's general direction. The Newcastle icon was adamant United would struggle to attract top players without the carrot of Champions League football.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, he said: “They’re going to have to recruit very well because clearly a lot of these players are not good enough or not suited to that style of play. They’re a million miles off it on and off the pitch and I don’t know how they get out of this.",
      "“How do they attract top players this summer and are they even going to be able to pay for them now they’re not in the Champions League? Why would big players want to go there?”",

      "According to Sky in Germany, Sesko has reacted positively to United’s interest. Amorim has already strengthened his forward line this summer with big-money moves for Bryan Mbeumo - who also picked them over a club playing in the Champions League - and Matheus Cunha, but the United boss still wants to add more firepower to his squad.",

      "“But the club will make the right decision with all the information that it has, and ultimately, to try and move the club forward in whatever way that is. Then it’s up to us to make good decisions the other way and try and improve the squad as best we can. That’s what we're trying to do, regardless of Alex's situation.",
      "“But I think there's a wider picture here. There’s a whole football club that has to make the decision. The ownership, together with the board of directors, especially with the money involved in modern day transfers. The manager of course has an opinion, but ultimately the decision will rest with the board.”",

      "Manchester United are stepping up their bid to sign a striker before the start of the new season – with Ollie Watkins now their first-choice target.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United are continuing that strategy with a move for Watkins, but are understood to be unwilling to meet Villa's £60million valuation of the 29-year-old.",
      "There is hope among the United hierarchy that a compromise figure of £40m-£45m for Watkins can be reached with Villa and enable a deal to be struck between the two clubs.",
      "Watkins scored 17 goals last season, 16 in the Premier League, with Amorim wanting a striker who can go straight into United's team and start scoring regularly, without needing time to adapt.",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping tabs on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are in pole position to sign the 22-year-old Slovenian.",
      "United are exploring the possibility of deals for Watkins and Sesko, but a move for Nicolas Jackson has been ruled out due to Chelsea's £80million asking price for him.",
      "While Amorim is keen to get a new striker signed as quickly as possible to give him time to settle in and build up an understanding with his new team-mates, he accepts that negotiations could drag on.",
      "In order to fund a move for a striker, United must raise revenue from player sales, with the double sale of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony – both left out of the US tour squad - enough to cover the cost of a new front man.",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia, who joined Garnacho and Antony in being left behind by Amorim, while Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona has saved around £12m, with the Spanish giants covering his wages for the whole of next season.",
      "United's determination to sign a new striker casts doubt over the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled last season, scoring just 10 goals from 52 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Villa sources insist Watkins is not for sale, but they wanted £60m from Arsenal in January, before changing their stance when Jhon Duran left to join Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a fresh move for PSG star Randal Kolo Muani, having previously targeted the forward in 2023. The club ultimately opted to sign Rasmus Hojlund ahead of Kolo Muani that summer, but the France international looks to be available once again.",
      "United were enticed by Hojlund’s long-term potential, having impressed during his time at Atalanta, resulting in an eye-catching £72million move to Old Trafford. After a slow start, the young Dane ended his debut season with 16 goals in all competitions, but he found the net on just 10 occasions last term.",
      "As United work on improving their frontline through the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim’s side have also been linked with a new number nine. Kolo Muani may have been snubbed in favour of Hojlund two years ago, but reports in Italy have claimed that United are targeting the PSG forward, who spent time on loan at Juventus last season.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that United have entered the race to sign Kolo Muani. The France international completed an initial £65m (€75m) move to PSG in 2023 following a prolific spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, which had also caught United's attention.",
      "The 26-year-old has since struggled to cement his place at the French club but showed signs of his best form during his Juventus loan spell, scoring 10 goals in 22 games. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani remains a top target for Juventus and discussions with PSG are ongoing, but United are also pursuing the forward.",
      "It is reported that United’s interest in Kolo Munai, who is claimed to favour a return to Turin, has become more concrete since missing out on Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. Meanwhile, PSG are keen to complete a permanent sale for the forward, though Juventus are said to have proposed a £8.6m (€10m) loan fee ahead of a future £39m (€45m) deal.",
      "However, if United succeed in snapping up Juventus target Kolo Muani, it could have a knock-on effect for Hojlund. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani heading to Old Trafford would lead Juventus to have an interest in signing Hojlund on loan.",
      "Hojlund does have Serie A experience from his sole season with Atalanta. The 22-year-old scored nine league goals for the Bergamo club before sealing his big-money move to United.",
      "The potential arrival of Kolo Muani would threaten Hojlund’s place in the pecking order. He is already competing with Joshua Zirkzee and youngster Chido Obi for a starting spot, while new signings Cunha and Mbeumo could also be viewed as alternative centre-forwards.",
      "Kolo Muani is in need of a fresh start, as it recently emerged that he has been made to train with the youth team as PSG looks to offload the forward. If a move fails to materialise this summer, he faces the unenviable task of competing with PSG’s Champions League-winning attack for game time.",
      "United have also been linked with moves for Aston Villa ’s Ollie Watkins and Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic. However, United boss Amorim recently played down the team’s need for new signings.",
      "\"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player,” Amorim explained. “If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "He added: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "Manchester United have been sent a come and get me plea by one of their transfer targets. Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is one of the players being considered to strengthen the position and he is very keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Ruben Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for his back-up Bayindir to fail to take his chance in goal.",
      "The situation has led to much speculation over potential targets this summer, with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma emerging. United even approached Villa over a loan deal for Martinez, only for their offer to be rejected out of hand, while Donnarumma is unlikely to swap Champions League winners for a side that finished 15th last season.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper, is clearly a much more attainable target for United at this stage. He is reportedly available for a fee of around £13m-17m after Antwerp sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes in his side’s 1-1 draw against Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in the league at the weekend. But speaking afterwards, it is clear that Lammens is courting a move away from Belgium.",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",
      "He added: “I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place. Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between.",
      "“As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.",
      "“It could be within a few days, but also a few months or a year. I have people around me who help me with that, and that way I can focus on what I need to do.”",
      "Royal Antwerp manager Stef Wils won’t stand in his way if United do come calling. “He’s proven why,” he said, referring to the transfer interest. “He has everything a modern goalkeeper needs, and as a young lad, he still has room to grow in a major league. He exudes calm and inspires confidence in his defenders, a plus on high balls.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United still have a lot of work to do in the summer transfer window after signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United endured a miserable 2024/25 season and know they need major reinforcements if they are to turn things around. Cunha, a £62.5million addition from Wolves, and Mbeumo, who cost a potential £71m from Brentford, are big signings, but it has been slow going on other fronts.",
      "The most important is at centre-forward, where United missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. They cannot afford another miss and have identified some new targets, including Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United know how difficult it can be to sign a striker, having missed out on at least three occasions already this summer to rivals. Well, another similar situation could be brewing with RB Leipzig striker Sesko and Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies lost out on Ekitike to Liverpool and need to replace Callum Wilson, even if Alexander Isak stays put. They are moving for Sesko and it appears to be a straight shoot-out with United, who are also interested.",
      "Local newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung says Sesko’s agent is in talks with both Newcastle and United and it could come down to the choice of the Slovenian. In that case, Sesko would ‘undoubtedly’ pick Ruben Amorim’s side, despite the fact they can’t offer any European football and Newcastle are in the Champions League.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is keen on a move to Manchester United. Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Ambitious moves for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma have gone nowhere, but Lammens is available for €15-20million (£13-17m).",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters after sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",

Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Al-Nassr appear to be coming to Manchester United’s rescue with a move for Antony. The Brazilian is one of the outcasts Amorim is desperate to sell, but a move back to Real Betis, following a successful loan spell, never materialised due to financial problems.",
      "Now the Saudi Arabian side have made their interest known. Fresh off the back of agreeing a deal for one Premier League flop, in the form of Chelsea’s Joao Felix, Al-Nassr also want to do the charity of signing Antony to join Sadio Mane and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.",
      "Antony would consider such a move, according to his agent, so it looks like a goer. Having already got rid of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, this would leave Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho as the final unwanted players to offload.",

      "Manchester United’s chances of signing Benjamin Sesko have been handed a huge boost with the forward left ‘impressed’ by the Red Devils. Ruben Amorim’s side are keen on adding a new striker to their squad this summer after a woeful season last time out.",
      "A number of forwards have already been linked including Viktor Gyokeres - albeit he has now completed a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal. Sesko has now emerged as a back-up option, with the Slovenian having caught the eye for RB Leipzig over recent seasons.",
      "Newcastle are also interested, with Sesko seen as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool. But the Red Devils have moved to the front of the queue with the striker’s own stance on a move.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, United chiefs have already been in touch with Sesko to lay out their project. They have also proposed figures to his representatives ahead of potentially launching talks with Leipzig.",
      "Luckily for United, Sesko has responded well, having been left impressed by what the Red Devils had to say. There is still some work to do on a deal though, with Leipzig wanting around £64m for their star forward.",
      "Meanwhile, boss Amorim has already spoken about what he wants from his new signings. He said: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",
      "Sesko, who has scored 39 goals for Leipzig over the past two seasons, has already revealed what could help him make a decision - a potential new club’s style of play. Speaking after he signed for Leipzig, he said: \"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations, but I think it was better to come here.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "He doubled down on that stance after penning a new contract with the German side last summer. He said: “Leipzig has given me a lot and continues to give me a lot every day. It’s a great club to develop at. In the future, I want to play for a club that suits me, that brings out the best in me. That’s the most important thing for me.”",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted the club had specifically targeted Cunha and Mbeumo due to their Premier League nous. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have scored more league goals than Watkins in the past three campaigns.",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap, Manchester United have been chasing shadows in their pursuit of a striker this summer.",
      "Delap was identified as United's top striker target ahead of the summer transfer window. Following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship, Delap was available via a £30million release clause. Unfortunately for United, Chelsea won the race for his signature, signing him in time for the start of the Club World Cup.",
      "Although Delap did well for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals, signing him to spearhead United's attack after just one season as a Premier League regular would have been a huge risk, meaning it is somewhat bold to suggest missing out on him was a 'blow'.",
      "Nevertheless, missing out on him has delayed their striker search. The additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have bolstered their attack, but they are still missing the main piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres, who has now joined Arsenal, have been and gone, while reports linking them with Victor Osimhen have persisted for as long as one can remember. Exactly where United's striker search will end remains to be seen.",
      "However, according to widespread reports, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has made his way back onto United's radar. Former football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer in 2022.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, have entered discussions with Sesko's representatives.",
      "With Delap, Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, who was also on United's radar earlier this summer, having all been snapped up already this summer, United's options are dwindling.",
      "United acknowledge they need to recruit a high-end striker to beef up Ruben Amorim's attack, and Sesko is arguably one of the very few left on the market that could be attainable.",
      "It goes without saying Leipzig will want a hefty-sized fee for the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal at the Red Bull Arena. He joined Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and signed a contract extension in June last year.",
      "Two seasons into his career in Germany, the Slovenian has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances in Leipzig colours. He scored 21 times last term.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article; he is still fairly young and finding his feet. In all honesty, United should be targeting someone more established and with a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Nevertheless, Sesko is an option United are reportedly running the rule over once again. And when you remember who is leading their recruitment this summer, it should come as no surprise.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who joined United last year, has been empowered to oversee the club's recruitment network and is a key part of the football structure at Old Trafford. Prior to joining the Reds, Vivell had stints at Chelsea and Leipzig.",
      "After joining the Bundesliga club in August 2020, he became their technical director, meaning he was responsible for recruitment and scouting across all age groups. He had previously spent five years at Salzburg, so is well-versed in the Red Bull model.",
      "Having swapped Salzburg for Leipzig, Sesko followed in his footsteps in 2023, swapping Austria for Germany. Leipzig agreed a deal to sign him in 2022, but the deal did not come into effect until the following year.",
      "Vivell was responsible for Leipzig's recruitment at the point of signing Sesko, meaning he knows all about the striker. He will be advising United and giving them insight on what he could potentially bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Sales, of course, remain key to United's chances of being able to land a big-name striker, and Sesko will command a big fee, but Vivell could make all the difference if a transfer tug-of-war unfolds.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, July 29.",
      "United were in action over the weekend, with Ruben Amorim's team kicking off their Premier League Summer Series campaign with a 2-1 victory over West Ham United. Reds captain Bruno Fernandes netted twice before Jarrod Bowen pulled one back in the United States, keeping the Reds' pre-season unbeaten run intact.",
      "The focus now shifts back to the transfer window, and two names that made headlines over the weekend are Benjamin Sesko and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Sesko is the latest forward being linked with a move to Old Trafford, while Donnarumma's contract situation at PSG has put United on high alert.",
      "There could also be some notable departures, with Antony reportedly close to finalising a move to Saudi Arabia. Al Nassr are believed to be leading the race to sign the Brazilian.",
      "Take a look at all the United transfer news and views as we get it below.",
      "The Daily Mail have suggested that United are willing to accept a bid worth £15m-£17m for Jadon Sancho this summer.",
      "United received £5m from Chelsea to cancel their obligation to buy agreement and are now said to be willing to lower their asking price. Sancho is in the final year of his contract after his 2021 move.",
      "Borussia Dortmund and said to be keen with Juventus also tracking him.",
      "Man United have reportedly joined the race to sign Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze and have established initial contacts.",

      "Barcelona have sent a message to Marcus Rashford after the Manchester United forward made his debut for the Catalan giants at the weekend.",
      "The La Liga champions will be footing the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save United around £12million. Barca also have the option to make his move to Catalonia permanent.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he now has his dream transfer to Barcelona after spending the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United are in desperate need of a new striker as they weigh up a move for Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The Reds are in dire need of a reliable goalscorer, having scored a mere 44 goals in the top-flight last season, their lowest tally in the Premier League era. After splashing out on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, United will need to offload players to fund further purchases.",
      "And the Reds have identified Aston Villa's Watkins as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski has offered his verdict on Marcus Rashford's move to the Nou Camp from Manchester United. The 27-year-old finalised a season-long loan move to Hansi Flick's side this week.",
      "Barcelona will be footing the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint in Catalonia, a move which is projected to save United approximately £12million. The La Liga champions also have the option to make his move permanent.",

      "PSG 1/1, Man United 6/1, Any Saudi Arabian Team 7/1, Galatasaray 8/1, Man City 8/1, Chelsea 10/1.",
      "bet365’s Steve Freeth said: “Reports suggest that Donnarumma will not be signing a contract extension at PSG and the arrival of Chevalier could see the giant stopper move on with a year left on his current deal.",
      "“A keeper of such quality will not be short of suitors with Manchester United and Chelsea being strongly linked.”",
      "Adrien Rabiot's mother has accused Manchester United of being \"disrespectful\" during transfer talks.",
      "Rabiot has been linked with a move to Old Trafford on several occasions, but United's interest was genuine in 2022 when they grew frustrated during a dragged-out pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong.",
      "Attention turned to Rabiot and a £15million fee rising to £20m was agreed with Juventus. However, the move collapsed and sources indicated it was due to the Frenchman's ‘obscene’ salary demands.",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard has backed Toby Collyer to succeed at Old Trafford despite the midfielder being likely to leave the club on loan this season. Collyer made his first appearance for United in the Community Shield against Manchester City last year, but has only been in the starting line-up three times since then.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders at the disposal of head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is anticipated that United's plan to arrange a loan move for Collyer will pave the way for a new midfield signing.",
      "Having joined the United academy from Brighton in 2022, Collyer signed a new contract last summer. However, he was sidelined for 28 matches due to three separate injuries last season, managing to make only 13 appearances.",
      "Read more here",
      "United great Rio Ferdinand believes that the \"only drawback\" for United in signing Watkins is that his age would eliminate a decent transfer \"sell-on value\" in the future. \"I think he would be a very, very good addition to the Manchester United squad,\" he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel. \"He scored 17 goals last season, 14 assists in 54 appearances.",
      "\"He's 29 - and that's the only drawback for Manchester United. There's not going to be any sell-on value, which I understand is an issue, but you've got to look at the here and now with Manchester United.\"",
      "Manchester United are weighing up a move for Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko as their striker signing.",
      "United have identified Aston Villa figurehead Watkins, 29, as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Well-placed sources have suggested Watkins would be open to joining United, who want a new starting striker following the £133.5million investments to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Read more here",
      "ESPN claim that deals have been explored for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, PSG's Randal Kolo Muani and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic at United this summer.",

      "According to a report from Calcio Mercato, Man United have made an offer of around £34m to sign Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand.",
      "The Danish international is said to have a release clause of around £69m in his contract, but Sporting are believed to be willing to do business at around £43m.",
      "United have yet to strengthen the defensive midfield this summer having signed Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo for the first team. Ruben Amorim had a strong relationship with Hjulmand prior to his exit from the club in November.",
      "Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna claims that Newcastle United's opening bid for Manchester United-linked Benjamin Sesko will be worth between €72m and €74m (around £62m).",
      "He adds that they are the ‘most serious contender’ for his signature.",
      "Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano has suggested there is a gentleman's agreement in place between the player and the club.",
      "After signing a new contract with Leipzig last summer, Sesko was reportedly told he would be allowed to leave if a suitable offer came in. That offer is believed to be in the region of £60million or more - a figure that could be within reach for United, provided they are able to offload some of their current players.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "The Reds are just weeks away from beginning their Premier League campaign with a daunting fixture against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Are the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo enough? Not many will think so.",
      "United's pre-season is well underway now, and a lot of attention will also be on transfers, with Sesko, Hjulmand, and many others being linked.",
      "Stick with us throughout the day for all the latest from Old Trafford!",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog today.",
      "Plenty to talk about particularly regarding Sesko and I am sure we have not heard the last about Hjulmand either.",

      "Bayern's affiliate club LAFC have also been tipped with a move for the shadow striker.",
      "United's young goalkeeper Radek Vitek has signed a contract extension at United this summer.",
      "Immediately after extending his stay at Old Trafford to 2028, the shot stopper agreed a loan switch to Championship club Bristol City.",
      "The 21-year-old spent last season at Austrian side FC Blau-Weiss Linz and has also spent time at Accrington Stanley during his career to date.",
      "United are looking to secure a loan departure for Toby Collyer this summer.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Collyer would be loaned out to make room for a midfield signing.",
      "The Reds feel that Collyer has to go out on loan for his development despite the midfielder's desire to remain in Manchester and fight for a place.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "It is ironic that Hjulmand is an Arsenal supporter because United will need to learn lessons from the Gunners if they are to sign the midfielder this summer.",
      "Sporting have proven to be tough negotiators recently, particularly in the case of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Ultimately, Arsenal managed to sign the Swede after reaching a compromise with their president Frederico Varandas which was a rather painstaking process.",
      "What United must take from this is perseverance and not become too disheartened if negotiations do not go their way immediately.",
      "Amidst the talk about the potential arrival of Sesko this summer, United are reportedly building their interest in Sporting midfielder and captain Morten Hjulmand.",
      "Calciomercato understands United have launched a bid worth £34m for the defensive midfielder.",
      "A £68m release clause is thought to be inserted in Hjulmand's contract but the Lisbon club are willing to negotiate around the £42m mark.",
      "Speaking of ensuring exits and subsequently transfer money is accrued, The Telegraph understands that Chelsea could still be in the hunt for Garnacho even if they sign Sesko's Leipzig teammate Xavi Simons.",
      "It is claimed that Garnacho would be seen as competition for Jamie Gittens on the left flank if he were to move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "However, first the Blues would need to sell Christopher Nkunku to make room for the United man.",
      "As mentioned by journalist Fabrizio Romano earlier on Monday, there is believed to be a gentleman's agreement in place between Sesko and Leipzig.",
      "It is believed that after he signed his new deal in Germany last summer, the forward was informed that he could leave if a suitable offer was made for his services.",
      "This suitable offer appears to be around the £60m+ mark which could be doable for United if they can sell the players they want to.",
      "Florian Plettenberg in Germany has shedded some light on Man United's race to sign Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko is believed to be impressed by this but Newcastle are not willing to back down and are ready to launch an offer.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on this Monday evening.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the rest of the night bringing you all the latest United news as we get it.",
      "Let's start with a look at a striker who could be on the way to Old Trafford",
      "Man United target Senne Lammens has been discussing the Reds amidn uncertainty over his future at Royal Antwerp.",
      "Lammens is one of the goalkeepers on United's radar but continues to be Antwerp's number one. He played in the 1-1 draw with Royale Union Saint-Gilloise and was asked about his future.",
      "\"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he said. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here.",
      "\"In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you've earned it.\"",
      "Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson has cleared the air regarding Christian Eriksen's proposed move.",
      "News broke last week, via MailSport, that the Championship side had enquired about signing the Denmark international, who is now a free agent after leaving United.",
      "The 33-year-old is still considering his options, but for now, it appears as if a move to Wales is off the cards.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" Parkinson said.",
      "\"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Radek Vitek has signed a new deal at Old Trafford until 2028.",
      "The 21-year-old will additionally join Bristol City in the Championship for the 2025/26 season.",
      "The move represents Vitek's third loan move away from United, following a successful stint with Blau-Weiss Linz in Austria.",
      "Vitek also spent time with Accrington Stanley back in 2024.",
      "Manchester United are set to sanction a summer loan move for midfielder Toby Collyer.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders available to head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is thought his temporary exit could open the door for a new addition.",
      "Although he didn't manage to get himself on the scoresheet against West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium on Saturday night, Rasmus Hojlund played well.",
      "He spearheaded United's attack and was very unfortunate not to give the Reds the lead inside the opening 50 seconds, smashing an excellent effort against the woodwork.",
      "Hojlund made several intelligent runs against the Hammers and was a general nuisance. Of course, the caveat is that pre-season games are very different to competitive fixtures.",
      "Nevertheless, Hojlund should be encouraged by his display. Of course, he is fighting to keep his place in the starting XI ahead of this coming season amid United's desperate need to sign a new striker.",
      "Even if Hojlund, for example, scores four goals in United's final three friendlies, the club will still need to sign a striker. On the flip side, a successful pre-season campaign for the Dane could elevate his stock and trigger more interest from elsewhere.",
      "Furthermore, a good pre-season could convince United to retain him and keep him as their second striker. That is the role he should have been signed to fill back in 2023.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly being watched closely by those at AC Milan.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan are searching for a striker who will provide competition with Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Hojlund is said to fit the bill, with Darwin Nunez and Juve star Dusan Vlahovic also of interest.",
      "“Rasmus Højlund also remains of interest. His agent recently offered him to Milan, although it’s Manchester United who would need to agree to a loan with an option to buy.”"

      "And then there were two.",
      "Manchester United initially went into the summer transfer window targeting Liam Delap while there was always an undercurrent of Viktor Gyokeres reuniting with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Chelsea and Arsenal have beaten the Reds to those punches and United have now focused their intentions on RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko and Aston Villa frontman Ollie Watkins.",
      "Slovenia superstar Sesko has a high ceiling and at 22 represents a long-term solution, while Watkins, 29, is a proven Premier League goalscorer.",
      "A year ago he was the toast of the country after slamming in a last-minute winner to take England to the final of Euro 2024.",
      "His driven strike into the far corner earned a 2-1 win over the Netherlands and gave the Three Lions a shot at ending their near-60-year wait for glory. 12 months on, and Watkins has fallen down the pecking order for club and country.",
      "He has not played for England in 2025, although injury ruled him out of the most recent camp, while he lost his spot at Villa to United loanee Marcus. Ironically it's United who could offer Watkins a lifeline - and the striker could do likewise for the Reds.",
      "He may be 29 and he may be valued at £60million - a figure that would surely need to be reduced for United to step in and do a deal - but he is a proven top flight goalscorer with the attributes Amorim wants from his central striker.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has failed to convince in the past two seasons and the Dane would benefit from time out of the limelight, while Joshua Zirkzee was never an out-and-out frontman and is more suited to a number 10 role.",
      "Watkins offers the perfect mix of a willing runner, goalscoring instincts and an ability to lead a line. His athleticism and finishing mark him out, while his aerial ability is far better than he is given credit for and ranks him among the league's best for headers won.",
      "The former Brentford man is also a willing presser, a hard worker and an intelligent footballer. He knows when to press and when to wait, when to exploit space and when to time his effort, when to strike and when to come short.",
      "When he was coming through the ranks at Exeter, his then-teammate Jacob Butterfield used to talk to him about Cristiano Ronaldo and how to isolate defenders. Watkins listened and learned, a theme of his career from a non-league spell at Weston-Super-Mare as recently as 2018, to international duty.",
      "His preparation is meticulous and his desire to improve has impressed countless coaches and teammates. Amorim wants hungry players who are capable of slotting into his system and Watkins fits the bill.",
      "The issue is that pricetag. United cannot and should not be paying the £60m Villa have as a valuation given his age and the relative lack of re-sale value, but if the Reds can drive that figure down then bringing in a talent such as Watkins seems a natural move.",
      "He's the right side of 30 and has the ability to hit the ground running. United have moved for potential as much as the present with many of their signings under Ineos but if the Reds are to move the dial and secure a return to the upper echelons of the Premier League, they have to focus on the here and now.",
      "And here and now, Watkins offers what United want.",

      "United made a pitch in an attempt to sign Ridgeon, but he will continue his development in London.",
      "The 16-year-old has signed a scholarship deal with Fulham, and he told the club's media: “It’s a very proud moment for me. I’ve been at the club since I was eight and gone all the way through, and now it’s a dream come true to sign with my boyhood club to keep the journey going.",
      "“Signing here for a lengthy period shows that Fulham produce young players and allow them to have the opportunity here, so I think it’s the best place to be for my development.”",
      "Ridgeon is regarded as one of the country's most exciting young attacking midfielders. United are always on the lookout for the best young talent to add to their youth ranks and they were hopeful of landing Ridgeon.",

      "Manchester United have been active in the loan market during the summer window.",
      "United have sent eight players on loan and Jonny Evans has been involved in some of the deals, having been appointed head of loans and pathways after retiring from his playing career.",
      "Evans now has the responsibility of arranging loans for academy youngsters and working closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first team'.",
      "The wheels were already in motion for some loan deals before the appointment of Evans, but he started work at the end of June and has contributed to a few moves.",
      "Here is a closer look at the loan departures so far from United this summer...",
      "After signing from Le Havre, Enzo Kana-Biyik immediately joined FC Lausanne-Sport on loan. The young striker has joined Ineos-owned Lausanne for regular game time this season, although he is said to have suffered a minor injury in training shortly after arriving in Switzerland.",
      "United signed Kana-Biyik on a free transfer because they believe he possesses first team potential. The 18-year-old has followed in the footsteps of Paul Pogba, who also joined United as a teenager from Le Havre.",
      "Sonny Aljofree spent last season on loan with Accrington Stanley, where he made 27 appearances, and United moved swiftly to arrange another loan for the youngster in 2025/26.",
      "Notts County finished sixth in League Two last season and Accrington finished in 21st.",
      "Aljofree impressed Notts County during his time with Accrington, who narrowly avoided relegation to the National League, and he will look to develop further at Meadow Lane.",
      "Earlier this month, defender Habeeb Ogunneye joined Newport County on a season-long loan.",
      "Newport boss David Hughes knows Ogunnye well, having worked closely with the youngster during his time as assistant manager of United's U21s, and was the driving force behind the deal.",
      "Dan Gore deserves some luck during his second loan with Rotherham after dealing with a handful of unfortunate injuries, which have disrupted his progress in the last two years.",
      "Gore suffered a foot injury shortly after signing for Rotherham in January and he recovered at Carrington. United planned for Gore to play for the Under-21s against West Ham for fitness in May, but Rotherham boss Matt Hamshaw wanted to start him in their final game of the season.",
      "Rotherham rate Gore highly, despite the youngster's limited time with the Millers during his loan last season, and it would be great to see him make up for lost time in the new campaign.",
      "Joe Hugill's loan with Carlisle didn't go as planned last season. Hugill scored just twice during his six months in Cumbria and Carlisle were relegated to the National League after a 20-year stay in the EFL.",
      "Hugill has now been sent to Barnet, who gained promotion to League Two last term.",
      "Elyh Harrison spent the first half of last season on loan with Chester. The youngster started every league game for Chester and kept seven clean sheets in 18 starts before being recalled to Carrington in January.",
      "United recalled Harrison to provide goalkeeping cover for the U21s and spend time in first-team training. Ruben Amorim subsequently named Harrison in eight matchday squads.",
      "The promising young goalkeeper has been sent to Shrewsbury Town this season. Joe Hart and Dean Henderson began their careers with Shrewsbury and Harrison has the potential to reach the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the outlier because he is a senior player with a wealth of experience, but Barcelona have the option to sign Rashford permanently at the end of the season.",
      "Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages, which is estimated to save United around £12million.",
      "Rashford's relationship with Amorim became frosty in December when he was dropped for the Manchester derby, and arranging his exit was a priority for United in the summer window.",
      "Radek Vitek is another exciting goalkeeping prospect. Vitek has joined Bristol City on loan for the new season, and it's always a good indicator when United arrange a loan for a young player in the Championship.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving division and this season will be a great challenge for Vitek, who impressed during his previous loan stints with Blau-Weiß Linz and Accrington Stanley.",
      "The 21-year-old looked sharp in pre-season with United last summer and has plenty of potential.",

      "Barcelona have sent a message to Marcus Rashford after the Manchester United forward made his debut for the Catalan giants at the weekend.",
      "The La Liga champions will be footing the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save United around £12million. Barca also have the option to make his move to Catalonia permanent.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he now has his dream transfer to Barcelona after spending the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "And the 27-year-old made his debut for Barca over the weekend, featuring briefly in a pre-season clash against Japanese side Vissel Kobe. Rashford replaced Raphinha at half-time, playing just 33 minutes before being substituted for Pedro Fernaandez.",
      "The Reds academy graduate has since reacted on Instagram after the match. \"First minutes in a Barca shirt! Vamos,\" he wrote, followed by blue and red love heart emojis.",
      "And his new employers have since reacted to the post with a simple, two-word message of their own. Commenting on the post, the club's official Instagram account replied: \"Welcome Rashy\", in Catalan, alongside the same emojis.",
      "Rashford found himself on the hunt for a new club this summer after Villa opted not to offer a permanent deal, while the striker was eager to return to Champions League football. Despite scoring just six times in the Premier League last season, Rashford managed to regain some form during his time in Birmingham, earning him his first England call-up since March 2024 under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "In his quest for a move to Barcelona this summer, Rashford turned to the AC Talent agency, renowned for its list of Spanish clients. The Catalans have been heavily linked with Rashford - and a move to La Liga has brought an end to his late-afternoon solo training sessions at Carrington.",
      "Tensions flared between head coach Ruben Amorim and Rashford in mid-December when the academy graduate was left out of the squad for the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium. Rashford's final appearance for United was against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on December 12.",

      "Manchester United are in desperate need of a new striker as they weigh up a move for Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The Reds are in dire need of a reliable goalscorer, having scored a mere 44 goals in the top-flight last season, their lowest tally in the Premier League era. After splashing out on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, United will need to offload players to fund further purchases.",
      "And the Reds have identified Aston Villa's Watkins as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Sesko probably has more potential but will almost certainly be more expensive. With United also needing a new midfielder - Watkins is the better option for where the Reds currently are.",
      "United have no European football and are poised for another transition season, so he is the perfect short-term solution for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Villa's striker might not take United to their ultimate aim of a league title or Champions League win, but he's the perfect stepping stone for where they currently are.",
      "Considering how United have already operated in this summer's transfer window, it would certainly make more sense for the Premier League proven striker to be signed.",
      "Going all-in for Sesko would be somewhat of a risk as he is still somewhat raw but his potential appears limitless. In Watkins, it is very clear that for the next four to five years, a consistent goal-scorer would be coming into the club but beyond that, it seems likely a new striker would have to come in.",
      "Despite the RB Leipzig forward having the tools to potentially be United's main man for the next decade or so, United are really not in a position to take a risk on another young striker and therefore it makes much more sense to make a move for Watkins.",
      "In this situation you would usually see me opt for the proven Premier League player, but I’m going to take a different stance here.",
      "I think Sesko would be the better signing for United, and while he will probably be more expensive it’s a more long-term solution to the striker conundrum currently plaguing United.",
      "A price of £45 million has been mentioned for Watkins, while Sesko would cost around £69 million. Although still in his prime, Watkins is 30 this year. Sesko, on the other hand, is just 22-years-old and has the potential to be a long-term solution for United.",
      "Spending out on Watkins now could mean that maybe in three years, United face another search and therefore another big transfer fee.",
      "While it is more of a risk, spending bigger now on Sesko could offer a longer-term solution for Ruben Amorim that the club could be thankful for over the next few years.",
      "There was a time when United would have been able to pluck both of these players from their clubs with relative ease. If they have to only settle for one, they have to look at who is the most likely to bring them success at a faster rate.",
      "Watkins stands out, therefore, as the senior option with a track record of deadly Premier League performances. He would be able to hit the ground running with Cunha and Mbeumo operating in support.",
      "Though there must be caution taken at the same time. Watkins is 29 so if Villa do demand too high a fee, United must have their own threshold in mind to say to themselves that it would be more financially viable to turn to Sesko instead and make him their long-term striker project in this Amorim team.",
      "I simply can't see how United can afford to sign Benjamin Sesko. Arsenal backing out of negotiations with RB Leipzig, despite the Slovenia international being their preferred target, says it all.",
      "The Gunners turning their attention to Viktor Gyokeres should speak volumes about how attainable Sesko is this summer. I can't see Leipzig agreeing to a favourable deal financially like Wolverhampton Wanderers did for Matheus Cunha.",
      "As such, of the two, seemingly only one option exists given the financial situation United find themselves in, especially after their outlay on Bryan Mbeumo. Ollie Watkins would presumably be available at a lower price, but arguably worse value due to the difference in age between the two strikers.",

      "Too many of Manchester United's recent superstar signings have failed to live up to the mark.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in typically Zlatan Ibrahimovic style, was different. He arrived at Old Trafford in 2016, announcing his move on social media 24 hours before an official statement. He was in the twilight of his career but plundered 29 goals in 43 starts, helping United win the Europa League, albeit he missed the final through injury, and the League Cup, in which he scored twice as the Reds beat Southampton.",
      "Benjamin Sesko would have taken note. The Slovenia superstar is being linked with a move to United and the prospect of him following in Ibrahimovic's footsteps is one that would excite both Sesko and Reds supporters.",
      "The 22-year-old has forged a reputation as one of Europe's leading goalscorers in recent seasons, transferring the form he showed breaking through at Red Bull Salzburg to the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig. United were first linked with a move for Sesko two years ago and speculation he could join this summer has ramped up in recent days.",
      "He was nothing more than a promising junior when Ibrahimovic was strutting his stuff at Old Trafford but a young Sesko, who is a keen basketball fan and was initially pressed into football as a goalkeeper by his dad, himself a former stopper, before becoming a forward, was enthralled by the Swedish superstar.",
      "“Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol,” he said in an interview in 2023. “I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.”",
      "One of those videos will likely have been the League Cup win in 2017 when Ibrahimovic netted a late winner to hand United the trophy. Sesko has spoken of an interest in playing in the Premier League: \"Of course it would be nice to play there,\" he mused shortly after signing for Leipzig.",
      "His stock has risen considerably since and it's easy to see why. Sesko is a towering forward with an eye for goal, aerial ability, and a thunderous strike, but he offers much more than 'the big man up top'.",
      "He is a willing channel runner, often retreats into midfield to pick up the ball and progress play while his dribbling ability makes him a danger from deep.",
      "He has 27 goals in 47 league starts for Leipzig, numbers that provide a belief he could cut it in the Premier League. And at United, as a focal point of an attack and with a new-look creative force behind him, he could thrive.",
      "If United were able to complete a deal for Sesko, it would significantly enhance a squad that has struggled for goals in the past two seasons and potentially provide a long-term solution.",
      "In his first interview as a Red, Ibrahmiovic said: \"I don't like to compare the past with the present.\"",
      "In Sesko, United would get a reminder of the past with a bright future ahead.",

      "New season, same old Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Yes, Ruben Amorim's first season in charge won't be judged on a pre-season win over West Ham United during a tour of the USA, but there were plenty of positives to emerge from their outing at the New York Giants' Met Life Stadium.",
      "Their performance would have pleased Amorim and so too would the two-goal contribution from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Too often United had to rely on the brilliance of their skipper to pull them out of trouble and that was signified by the fact he scored 19 goals and registered 18 assists in one of United's most forgettable seasons for decades.",
      "If United are going to get back to the top, they need their captain to maintain that brilliant form this season. The key is for others to step up with meaningful contributions of their own.",
      "However, it had been though that Fernandes would be used in a deeper central midfield role this season, having largely impressed as one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders in his 3-4-2-1 formation last term.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had been tipped to take those two roles this season but in the absence of Mbuemo, Fernandes lined up alongside Cunha in a more advanced role.",
      "And he showed his qualities, linking up with the Brazil international well, and offering Amorim some food for thought - particularly given Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo played well together at the base of midfield.",
      "Mbeumo will be introduced to the side in the coming days and weeks and it will be interesting to see what that means for Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal international has always offered versatility in where he is used in midfield and it is hard to imagine United won't team up Mbeumo and Cunha, who scored 37 goals between them last term, in the more advanced midfield roles.",
      "But Fernandes sent a timely reminder of what he can do there and with Mason Mount and Amad also options that can be used in those roles, Amorim suddenly has a number of options at his disposal.",
      "If the deeper Fernandes experiment doesn't work, Amorim won't hesitate to change his plan.",

Fernandes should have doubled his tally but was denied by Alphonse Areola, but there was nothing the West Ham goalkeeper could do to stop the United captain doubling his side’s lead with a superb curling effort just minutes later.",

      "Looked comfortable back in midfield alongside Manuel Ugarte and was quietly effective during his 65 minutes. 7",

      "It was easy to miss but Ruben Amorim might have just aimed a subtle dig at Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Amorim was asked about his new signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while out on the tour of the US, and said: “They are really humble. They know how to fit into a group, they don’t act like stars.",
      "\"They also understand that this is not the moment to want to be a star. They are team players at the same time. But it's not just what they give to the team, it's the way they make the feel with their teammates, so they are improving this team in every aspect.\"",
      "Amorim produced that answer during an interview with MUTV ahead of Manchester United's game against West Ham in New Jersey. The clip has gained some traction, but a lot of supporters won't have seen it.",
      "United's head coach is a good communicator. His comments could be taken at face value, but it felt like he was sending a message to the players who have crossed him at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both dropped for the Manchester derby in December. Rashford recently moved to Barcelona on loan and Garnacho is set to leave.",
      "Amorim outlined his vision for the dressing room when he appeared to have a dig at Rashford and Garnacho during his interview in the States. The United head coach wants elite players and stars in the dressing room - just not at the expense of the team.",
      "Building a healthy culture is crucial to building a successful team and Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room, which is why Rashford and Garnacho have been kicked out.",
      "Erik ten Hag improved standards during his two-and-a-half-year reign and took on Cristiano Ronaldo. Amorim isn't stupid and has quickly decided Rashford and Garnacho cannot be part of his squad.",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Amorim suggested he would be open to reintegrating members of the 'bomb squad', but that felt like a deliberate ploy to protect players' value.",
      "Amorim has moved on with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. The 40-year-old is delighted with United's new additions because they are brilliant players with the character needed to thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "United don't have room in their squad for players who criticise the manager's section calls or walk straight down the tunnel after being substituted.",
      "Those are just two of the issues Amorim encountered with Garnacho during his nine months in Manchester.",

      "Following confirmation of his move to Arsenal on Saturday night, Viktor Gyokeres will no longer be linked with Manchester United.",
      "The Swede had been linked with a move to Old Trafford over the last few months amid United's desperate need for a striker in this summer's transfer window.",
      "Having excelled under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, many believed it was inevitable he would end up reuniting with him in M16.",
      "However, United never tabled an offer for the striker. As a result, they are still looking for a proven goalscorer to complement the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With just three weeks to go until the start of the new Premier League season, time is running out for United to find the goalscorer they are looking for.",
      "Although Amorim has publicly said he would be \"happy\" to start the season without a new striker at the tip of his attack, the feeling is probably different behind closed doors.",
      "Having spent more than £120million on Cunha and Mbeumo, United need to raise funds via player sales to continue their recruitment drive. The aforementioned duo are statement signings and United will want a No.9 of the same mould.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United have been chasing shadows in their striker search. They have been linked with countless names but they are still waiting to make a breakthrough.",
      "If United are to follow the same blueprint in their search for a striker that led them to Mbeumo and Cunha, they are likely to target a goalscorer with Premier League pedigree. However, Premier League proven strikers are not cheap.",
      "However, in a summer in which failing to sign a striker will be costly, United might not be left with any choice but to loosen their purse strings one last time.",
      "If that proves to be the case, they should be setting their sights on Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. He enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, helping Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "The 28-year-old was one of the best strikers in the Premier League last term, scoring 14 league goals, two of which were scored against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Frenchman has made solid progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz, initially on loan, four-and-a-half years ago, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he required time to adapt, so much so it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to consistently show his class.",
      "Scoring 19 times in 2023/24, Mateta has scored 36 goals in the last two seasons for Palace. Of those 36 goals, 30 were plundered in the Premier League, meaning he has an established record in England's top flight.",
      "Mateta ticks plenty of boxes. He is a defender's worst nightmare, both with the ball at his feet and in the air.",
      "After Palace triggered the 12-month option in his contract last December to extend his stay at Selhurst Park until June 2027, they have ensured they have protected his value. His deal was originally due to expire next June.",
      "Despite that, Palace may be mindful that this summer could represent their last chance to get the best possible price for their chief goal-getter.",
      "If they fail to tie him down to a new deal within the next 12 months, clubs will try and land him for a cut-price fee next summer amid the fact he will have just one year left on his contract.",
      "Palace will be accounting for plenty of factors this summer, and keeping Mateta will be a priority for them. He is their main striker and losing him would be a massive blow.",
      "But as United have demonstrated with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo, they still have plenty of pulling power. Palace's demotion to the Europa Conference League from the Europa League could also play into United's hands.",
      "There is no denying Mateta will cost a hefty fee this summer, but Palace might be prepared to negotiate amid the possibility their grip on his future this time next year could be weaker.",

The Cameroon international joins Matheus Cunha in completing a move to Old Trafford as they now prepare for the new Premier League season, which gets underway next month.",
      "United have more than a month to go until the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Between now and then, there are likely to be plenty of rumours about who United may or may not sign before the window closes.",
      "A report in Give Me Sport has claimed that United star Kobbie Mainoo is a target for Tottenham Hotspur this summer.",
      "It has been reported that Spurs have identified Mainoo as a target after missing out on signing Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest.",
      "The report claims that Tottenham will look to take advantage of Mainoo's contract situation remaining unresolved, with the midfielder's current deal running until the summer of 2027.",
      "MEN Sport says: Mainoo is one of the most talented prospects at United and is destined for a bright future at Old Trafford. The contract uncertainty is unsurprisingly leading to speculation around his future, so United would be wise to get a new deal wrapped up as soon as possible.",
      "United are once again being linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, United will look to provide competition to Juventus for the signing of Kolo Muani this summer.",
      "The France international spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, who are reportedly interested in re-signing the striker on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "MEN Sport says: United have been linked with several strikers already this summer, and Kolo Muani is one of the players credited as a potential target in recent weeks. Only time will tell if United will make an active attempt to sign Kolo Muani, but it seems that they may find it difficult to fend off competition from Juventus.",

      "Manchester United want everyone to know their striker transfer shortlist is down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, even if it makes them look stupid.",
      "",
      "“In the last decade and in this period, we couldn’t always get the players we wanted,” Erik ten Hag told Gary Neville last May. “Then you have to build and you have to accept that you get talent in instead of players who have already proved it in the past.",
      "“We have had some choices made with talents like Rasmus Hojlund,” he continued. “I can see a striker who already proved it, who we wanted to sign and we couldn’t get him. And then we went to Rasmus because he’s a talent.",
      "“With Harry Kane you know you get 30 goals. I think Rasmus will get there but he needs time. It’s not fair to assess him the same as Harry Kane. I would never compare two players because they are very different.”",
      "One year, a managerial change and sporting director departure later, Manchester United are back comparing “very different” strikers in terms of profile and style again.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could the ‘narrowing’ of a transfer shortlist produce two targets at opposing ends of the broad centre-forward spectrum.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could that development be briefed to the usual cabal of journalists like an underachieving child proudly showing their working-out for a sum they will inevitably get wrong.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could history repeat itself in such a peculiar way.",
      "In the claret and blue corner, the proven Premier League experience of a seasoned England international about to enter his 30s. In the Red Bull corner, the pure promise of a prodigious centre-forward who has never played in the Premier League by his early 20s.",
      "And those are just the surface-level differences between the players Manchester United are choosing from to lead the line in this brave attacking restructure under Ruben Amorim.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER COVERAGE\n👉 Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony\n👉 Top 10 Alexander Isak clones only leave three options for Newcastle, Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "Watkins is a defence-stretching runner whose touches almost exclusively come within the confines of the penalty area and are reflected in his goal and assist output; Sesko drops deep to engage heavily in the build-up, dribbling and passing while generally taking his shots from much further away.",
      "Yet only now, with August looming and Manchester United on their pre-season tour, are they ‘in the process of weighing up Watkins and Sesko for their contrasting styles, suitability to Ruben Amorim’s team, and financial outlay’.",
      "That was one of the lines used by one of the writers blessed enough to be given access to Manchester United’s grand recruitment operation and it exposes the absurdity of a search which essentially amounts to consulting a formerly good website for their ideas on the best feasibly attainable strikers this summer, without an actual thought as to where and how they would fit for them specifically as a club.",
      "But at least Manchester United had the self-awareness to rule out a move for Alexander Isak. Once his name and that of Nicolas Jackson was scribbled out along with that of Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap earlier in the summer, this bizarre battle between Watkins and Sesko became inevitable as the two strikers left standing with no similarities beyond their position.",
      "It is not quite the same scenario the club faced with Hojlund and Kane in 2023. There was a chasm between those two players and it was reflected in the cost required to complete either deal. Manchester United also did well to rule out the latter early – then obviously dragged their heels over the former to the extent he was signed a week before the season started.",
      "Watkins is a slightly younger – although still of a Ratcliffe rule-breaking age – and far less prolific Kane counterpart two years on, while Sesko is older and further ahead in his evolution than Hojlund was and probably ever will be.",
      "There will be debates over resale value, high ceilings, acclimatisation periods, risk and experience versus potential.",
      "It is a difficult choice but also not one a club with any degree of competence would leave itself to make. If Manchester United have whittled their possible answers down to either Watkins or Sesko, they have forgotten the question and just started naming strikers they know.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘confident’ of signing RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko for one key reason amid interest from Newcastle United.",
      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",
      "A diabolical transfer window for Newcastle will get worse when they miss out on Benjamin Sesko and Yoane Wissa before signing a Liverpool player for £50m.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is  ‘impressed’ by Man Utd’s ‘efforts’ to sign him ahead of Newcastle this summer as RB Leipzig’s asking price has been revealed.",
      "Man Utd have now made a ‘concrete’ ‘move’ to beat Newcastle to Sesko, according to Fabrizio Romano, with an ‘agreement in principle’ struck for the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Man Utd face a potential knockout blow in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle are the ‘most serious’ contenders, according to reports."

      "Since landing Mbeumo, the Red Devils have turned their attention to landing a new striker as they need an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee after they only scored seven Premier League goals between them in 2024/25.",
      "Unfortunately for United, they have already missed out on a couple of targets as they have failed to sign Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "‘They had been exploring a deal for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, but have ruled out a move due to the cost. United had held back from Sesko due to the finances required, but talks have now taken place to establish some details around a potential move. The same has occurred for a Watkins deal.’",
      "Man Utd’s moves for the two players are complicated by Newcastle also being interested, but a report from ESPN has an update on INEOS’ two ‘preferred’ striker targets.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly decided that Sesko and Watkins are their ‘most viable’ targets, though ‘there are concerns at United about the potential cost of the deals with the valuations of Aston Villa and RB Leipzig, respectively, considered to be prohibitive’.",
      "Despite this, the Red Devils are ‘confident’ of landing Sesko as they feel he ‘would pick United over Newcastle if they press ahead and begin talks with RB Leipzig’.",
      "Regarding Watkins, the report adds:",
      "‘Villa, meanwhile, are insisting they will not let Watkins leave. There is, though, a belief at United that the right offer could tempt Villa to part with the 29-year-old, who was the subject of a bid from Arsenal in January.",

      "Bournemouth: Andoni Iraola – 2026\nGary O’Neil was axed and Iraola brought in with a more progressive style of football after his contract with Rayo Vallecano expired. He was handed a two-year contract, which seems sensible. Then he signed a contract extension at the end of his first season, which also seems sensible.",
      "",

      "Onana’s long-term future is in doubt as Man Utd have been heavily linked with several potential replacements as they scour the market for alternatives, with Donnarumma and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez mooted as options.",
      "There was an update on Tuesday morning as a report from The Athletic revealed that the Red Devils have ‘effectively ruled out’ a move for Martinez as United’s finances are limited and he ‘can only leave on a permanent deal’.",
      "READ: Newcastle shown how biggest transfer windfalls were spent: Liverpool masterclass and disaster, Fergie’s Glazer glazing",
      "Despite this, Flashscore have claimed that a move for Donnarumma is still on as Man Utd have a ‘real chance’ of a ‘stunning move’.",
      "26-year-old Donnarumma is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he shone for PSG as they won the Champions League last season, but he is heavily linked with an exit as he has entered the final year of his contract and currently looks unlikely to pen an extension.",
      "Last week, A report from Caught Offside revealed: ‘PSG have been negotiating with him for over a year on a new contract.",
      "‘Donnarumma earns €7 million net salary plus €3 million in bonuses, but the club’s offer didn’t satisfy him. He has decided not to renew his deal, and with only one year left on his contract, PSG have decided to sell him this summer.’",
      "Now, Flashscore claim PSG have ‘moved forward’ with plans to replace him with Lille’s Lucas Chevalier, while Fabrizio Romano revealed on Tuesday morning that his move to the Champions League holders is close.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Paris Saint-Germain are at final stages of Lucas Chevalier deal, here we go soon!",
      "‘€40m [£35m] deal being sorted directly between presidents Al Khelaifi and Letang as Lille ask for more add-ons, but very close. Chevalier accepted a five year deal last week.’",
      "As for Donnarumma, Man Utd have a ‘real chance’ of landing him, but Flashscore point out that they are currently ‘stuck’ as they are at ‘full capacity’ and a loan is ‘more realistic.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Their failure to offload Andre Onana means there is no clear pathway to bring in another top-tier goalkeeper. The idea of carrying two premium-salaried, permanent stoppers was dismissed internally earlier this summer and reversing that stance now would mean tearing up their transfer plan.",
      "‘There was also hope that Altay Bayindir would move on to free up a squad spot, but interest in the Turkish international has been limited. United are currently at capacity in the goalkeeper department and are actively working out how to reshape things before they can commit to anything.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked out their ‘next big target’ after landing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly ‘decided to sell’ a ‘top name’ on Manchester United’s ‘shortlist’ to replace a current starter at Old Trafford.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly doing “everything they can” to stop a Manchester City target from looking to leave the club this summer.",
      "Man Utd have launched a surprise bid to convince Italy and Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Manchester City are interested in replacing Ederson with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports."

      "Manchester United have whittled their striker shortlist down to two – which could spell further bad news for Newcastle…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Jackson is off Man Utd’s list because of the anticipated costs involved. Which Chelsea won’t compromise on if they know Newcastle have an Isak-sized windfall on the way.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "17) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "16) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "15) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly.",
      "",
      "13) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But now here come Man Utd. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "6) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who is waiting for a Premier League club to spare him once again from playing in the Championship.",
      "",
      "5)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "4) Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked to be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, is already in Wearside for a medical.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Joao Felix – Chelsea to Saudi\nChelsea, owned by Clearlake Capital with whom PIF have billions invested, are selling a player we’d almost all forgotten still plays for them to Al-Nassr for around £44million. That’s convenient for everyone, isn’t it? Unsurprisingly, this is going through quickly, with Felix already in Saudi.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nThe Colombian is now in Bavaria to undergo a medical after a fee of £65million was agreed. There’s half the Isak money…",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect. A medical was due to begin on Monday so we expect confirmation in the coming days."

      "7) Yan Couto: Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund, £21m rising to £25m\nCouto joins a list of 12 players, including Pedro Porro, Aaron Mooy, Jason Denayer, Jack Harrison and Douglas Luiz, that City have sold for a combined £113m having never made an appearance for club. Incredible.",
      "Maximo Peronne was also sold this summer, to Como for £11.2m, having featured for just 20 minutes in a City shirt.",
      "",
      "6) Anthony Elanga: Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, £52m rising to £55m\nNo other team in world football is paying that fee for Elanga. That definitely doesn’t mean it was wrong for Newcastle to pay it, before all of this Alexander Isak heartache it was the one area of the pitch where there was the biggest potential for improvement and he’s a very Eddie Howe player – direct, powerful and speedy.",
      "But Forest must have been a tad surprised when Newcastle returned with an extra £10m after seeing their initial £45m bid knocked back for the Swede. He’s valued at £36m and cost them under £20m.",
      "A penny for the thoughts of the Manchester United chief who opened the door to that sale to Forest in the summer of 2023 due to ‘reservations over Elanga’s ability to break down stubborn defences in a United team that had expectations to dominate possession during games’ before sacking that manager and hiring one whose modus operandi is dynamism in transition.",
      "Now we think about it, United are the second team in world football who would have paid that fee for Elanga had that move not required a hilarious and embarrassing climbdown.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford to Manchester United, £65m rising to £71m\nThere was a time when mid-table Premier League sides were bullied into letting their prized assets leave for Manchester United. As soon as they came calling, that was that, with a club the size of Brentford expected to kiss rings and bow in appreciation of the Red Devils bestowing such honour on them by being interested in one of their players.",
      "Not for the first time, nor we suspect the last, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Ineos lads played their hand way too early. Brentford weren’t happy that they approached Mbeumo first, and when the forward then made it clear he only wanted the move to Old Trafford despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, the Red Devils created a situation for themselves where they either had to meet Brentford’s demand – which didn’t change despite contrary reports pushed by United – or flounce away from their top target to the great enjoyment of the masses who feed on evidence that a once-great club is great no longer.",
      "They opted save face and were indeed ‘held to ransom’ despite Ratcliffe’s insistence that he wouldn’t be, paying some £18m over Mbeumo’s market value.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke: Chelsea to Arsenal, £48.5m rising to £50m\nIn our latest instalment of Both Things Can Be True, we see this as a good signing from Arsenal but also a very good sale by Chelsea. The Gunners wanted an option for both left and right wings, whose first thought is to take defenders on, at a good age with a high ceiling; Madueke is all those things.",
      "And while the logic in coaching a player, watching them improve and then selling them before seeing whether they can fulfil their potential in favour of someone at the onset of what will likely be a very similar journey in Jamie Gittens is at best questionable and at worst a sign that Chelsea as a football club aren’t actually all that interested in developing young talent but buying and selling them until they uncover ready-made gems, on the face of it they have made close to £20m on a forward who got 20 goals and nine assists in 92 appearances for them.",
      "",
      "3) Luis Diaz: Liverpool to Bayern Munich, £65.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox should take note. Weirdly, the best way to get the most amount of money for a footballer who wants to leave and you don’t particularly want at your football club for at least that reason and possibly others, isn’t to drop them to a bomb squad and announce to the world that you’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "The party line from Liverpool and Arne Slot for the majority of this transfer window, amid interest from Barcelona, Saudi Arabia and Bayen, was that they had ‘no plans’ to sell Diaz.",
      "They also had no plan to offer him an improved contract, and will therefore have known that Diaz would likely push for an exit. But he went on tour with Slot and his teammates, at least providing interested clubs with the illusion of a possible harmonious future at the club if they fail to up the ante.",
      "And Bayern did. After the Premier League champions rejected an opening bid of £58.6m from the Bundesliga giants, they’ve now accepted a £65.5m bid including add-ons, or 44% of an Alexander Isak, for a 28-year-old valued by Transfermarkt at £60m.",
      "",
      "2) Jarell Quansah: Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m rising to £35m\nWe have no way of finding this out/didn’t even try, but we posit that there has never been a greater transfer-fee-per-senior-start paid (yes, it’s a thing if we say so) than the £875,000 Bayer Leverkusen have spent on Quansah per appearance from the off under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Anfield.",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are admittedly a very good reason why Quansah’s not played all that much and it’s technically possible for the game time of the third best centre-back in the world to be limited in a similar manner.",
      "But he wouldn’t be in many people’s top 50 as things stand and that was just too delicious a chunk of pure profit to turn down, with the Reds also safe in the knowledge that they can buy him back for £50m should his progression be as impressive as many of us thought it may be a year or so ago.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Felix: Chelsea to Al Nassr, £26m rising to £44m\nThe guaranteed £26m fee brings the total spent by clubs acquiring what we don’t think anyone will disagree are Felix’s limited services to just over £180m.",
      "After bizarrely spending £44m to sign him from Atletico Madrid last summer after a hugely underwhelming loan spell at Stamford Bridge the season before, Chelsea are miraculously set to make all of that money back thanks to Al Nassr, and could actually be up on the deal having already banked close to £5m from his six-month loan spell at AC Milan.",
      "The Blues are also said to have wisely inserted a hefty sell-on clause into the deal with Al Nassr, as another wealthy football club thinking they can ‘fix’ Joao Felix is the third certainty after death and taxes.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "A list of 14 players could reportedly be made available by Chelsea this summer, with some big names expected to be surplus to requirements.",
      "Leeds United will stay in the Premier League if they sign a ‘new Raphinha’. Simple enough, right? We’ve created a ten-player shortlist for Daniel Farke.",
      "Former AC Milan and Chelsea great Marcel Desailly has seen plenty of Joao Felix over his itinerant career and feels he just still hasn’t ‘found his place’",
      "A new report has revealed ‘eleven’ Chelsea players are set to be sold this summer as club chiefs are looking to raise funds for a ‘super signing’."

      "“If the player tells Leipzig ‘there is a club I consider special’ there is a gentleman’s agreement to make the price drop to €70-80 million. So €70-80m… let’s say this is the range and then €5-10m in add ons, so this could be the package for Sesko, a gentleman’s agreement if the player wants.",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are exploring moves away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Asked if the club was concerned about losing value on those players in order to sell them, Amorim said: \"That is not the case because there are different reasons for the players [wanting to leave]. Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",
      "United agreed the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona this week having brought in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as Amorim looks to revamp his front line.",
      "\"At the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,\" said Amorim. \"If we have to start the season with this squad, then I'm happy because all the players want to be here. That is the most important thing.",
      "\"With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.",
      "Amorim said: \"They (Mbeumo/Cunha) can play as a striker. We have Josh (Zirkzee) and Rasmus (Hojlund), the focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work. They have other players fighting for that position.",
      "\"I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.\"",
      "Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been training separately from the first team and are not on the pre-season tour of the United States amid their wish to leave.",
      "United are understood to believe Garnacho wants to remain in the Premier League.",
      "Juventus' move for Sancho is on hold until sales are made after they signed Francisco Conceicao this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven while Antony thrived at Real Betis.",

      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",

      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",
