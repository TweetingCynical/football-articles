      "Viktor Gyokeres is said to be prioritising a move to Arsenal or Juventus this summer The Swede would even prefer to join Manchester City or Liverpool, as opposed to long-time admirers Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres has fired his way to becoming one of European football's elite marksmen, bagging 97 goals in just 102 games for Portuguese outfit Sporting CP, whom he has helped to a pair of league titles.",
      "When head coach Ruben Amorim departed Sporting to take up the reins at Old Trafford in November, the prospect of Gyokeres following suit was mooted, given the Red Devils' faltering forward line. Although United have persued the 27-year-old with robustness this summer, reports earlier this month detailed that Gyokeres had turned his nose up at a Manchester reunion.",
      "Now, Portuguese outlet A Bola say that Gyokeres has become frustrated with a lack of transfer movement, but has set out which clubs he would like to join this window. They are Mikel Arteta's Gunners and Juventus, who have supposedly tabled a mammoth £11-million-a-year wage offer.",
      "According to the report, five clubs have expressed an interest in signing Gyokeres, with the Swedish striker currently enjoying a well-earned holiday.",
      "In England, both United and Arsenal have long been documented to hold the goalscorer in high regard, and Atletico Madrid, Juve and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other noted suitors.",
      "However, Gyokeres has supposedly prioritised moving to either the Emirates or Turin, and to rub further salt into the Red Devils' wounds, it is claimed he would also welcome any approach made by rivals City and Liverpool.",
      "It is said that the £70million-rated Swedish star would also prefer moves to the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG or Bayern Munich, and he remains 'upset' that he has not yet been allowed to make a switch.",
      "While Gyokeres has seemingly made it crystal clear that a move to north London would be his ideal Premier League transfer, the Gunners also have their eye on another striker.",
      "Reports from German outlet BILD suggest that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is close to joining Arsenal this window, and personal terms have been agreed between both parties. With the Bundesliga club failing to qualify for European football this term, a fee in the region of £70m-£85m could seal the deal.",
      "Gyokeres may then turn his attention to his other priority, Juventus, who Corriere dello Sport reports have offered him a lucrative £11m per year to leave for Serie A.",
      "With it seeming increasingly likely that Gyokeres will not join United, Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has emerged as another name who could be brought in to bolster United's firepower.",
      "As first reported by The Times, Amorim's side are interested in making a move for the Frenchman, and a £60m price tag has been slapped on the star who scored 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "\"I'm glad we have him [Ekitike]. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go,\" admitted Frankfurt chief Markus Kroshce ahead of what promises to be an incident-packed transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "A supercomputer has tipped Liverpool to retain their Premier League title ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal after the fixtures for the new season were released. The schedules for all 20 top-flight clubs were announced on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Reds stormed to their first title since 2020 last season in what was boss Arne Slot's first campaign as manager after replacing Jurgen Klopp. Arsenal finished as the runners-up for the third successive year, while City's hopes of defending their crown for a fifth successive year ended in tatters.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the surprise package of the year, securing qualification to the Europa Conference League. Down at the other end of the table, relegated Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have been replaced by Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Anticipation for the new season will only be growing as the summer goes on, with the summer transfer window in full swing. Liverpool have been working hard to give Slot the best chance of leading a successful title defence.",
      "They have already signed Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez on their way into Anfield. And it appears that those moves may well pay off for the Reds.",
      "According to a supercomputer from BettingLounge.co.uk, Liverpool will finish top of the league for a second successive year. The supercomputer is a probability model, not determined by human predictions or bias.",
      "It instead estimates the outcome of each remaining fixture based on a team’s current strength (based on factors such as league position and form) and betting market odds. The machine then simulates the remaining games in a season 10,000 times and constructs an average league table from the 10,000 simulations, to rule out anomalous results.",
      "Slot's side have been backed to lose just four games and win 24 matches to claim the title. Their closest challengers are tipped to be City, who are predicted to finish three points behind the Reds.",
      "Arsenal are expected to drop down to third, with the supercomputer tipped them to end up a mammoth 10 points adrift of the champions. Having missed out on the Champions League last season, Aston Villa are predicted to return to Europe's premier competition by finishing fourth.",
      "Newcastle are tipped to round out the top five as they continue to impress under Eddie Howe. Those two will be on the rise at Chelsea's expense, with the Blues set to drop to sixth under Enzo Maresca.",
      "While they have lost boss Thomas Frank, Brentford will not feel his absence, with the Bees tipped to end up seventh. Brighton and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace will take up the two places just behind the Londoners.",
      "And Bournemouth are predicted to round out the top half, despite losing a raft of players in this summer's window. With European football to deal with, Nottingham Forest are set to suffer and drop down to 11th in the table.",

      "Manchester United have been handed the hardest first five games of the season, according to stats boffins - despite Arsenal fans bemoaning their “crazy” opening run. The fixtures for the 2025-26 Premier League season were revealed on Wednesday - and there are some tricky schedules for some of the division's big hitters.",
      "Newly-promoted Leeds United represent Arsenal’s first home opponents of the season. Arsenal then face what is arguably their most difficult fixture the following weekend as they travel to Anfield to take on reigning champions Liverpool.",
      "Their run does not get any easier as they welcome Nottingham Forest to North London in mid-September - the Midlands side having challenged for a Champions League place last season.",
      "Arsenal then face their former title rivals Manchester City at the Emirates before a trip to St James’ Park to take on Newcastle United. Arteta will certainly be hoping that his side can come out of those six fixtures unscathed as he attempts to finally end the club’s long wait for the title.",
      "But it’s actually United who statistically have the hardest run, according to Opta. They host the Gunners on the opening day before clashes with Fulham and Burnley.",
      "A trip to rivals Manchester City follows ahead of a showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Opta have given United's run a difficulty rating of 94.6, while Arsenal’s opening fixtures sit marginally lower at exactly 94.",
      "But some Arsenal fans aren’t too convinced, with some even claiming that a title challenge could be over before it’s even begun. One fan said: “Starting the season with Man U, Leeds, Liverpool, Forest and City is really crazy..”",
      "Another responded: “Someone at the Premier League wanted to see Arsenal cooked from the jump! This is such a tough start. Well, if you want to be champions… Mountains must be climbed, no matter how soon you face them.”",
      "A final fan added: “Such a testing start for Arsenal. Manchester United (a), Leeds (h), Liverpool (a), Forest (h), Manchester City (h), Newcastle (a), West Ham (h). If Mikel Arteta’s side can start well then it’s game on. If not they could be out of the title mix come October’s international break…”",
      "Meanwhile, some fans have issued a demand to Arsenal boss Arteta to get a move on in the transfer market given the Gunners’ tough start. One supporter said: “Mad start to the season for Arsenal, makes it even more important to get deals done ASAP.”",
      "A further fan replied: “I beg of you for only one thing please have every single of transfer business done before the start of this new season, that schedule is looking insane new striker leading the line please sesko or gyorokes get it done maybe even both now seeing that run in.”",
      "A final fan added: “That’s a serious start. Arsenal better buck up their ideas in this transfer window and act fast, man.”",

      "The fixture list for the 2025-26 Premier League season has officially been released, and every club vying for top-flight supremacy has found out their potential paths to glory. Liverpool enter the new campaign as reigning champions, after Arne Slot delivered them the crown in his debut term.",
      "Arsenal, who have played second fiddle for the past three seasons, will be hoping to go one better this campaign, and have an early chance to prove their worth when they head to Old Trafford on the opening weekend before a trip to Anfield in late August. They'll host rivals Tottenham in November, with the reverse North London Derby taking place in early February.",
      "Manchester City will have enforcer Rodri back in action for the new season, and take on Wolves during the league's opening weekend, with a Manchester Derby to look forward to in September, as well as a battle with the Gunners one week later.",
      "As was the case last year, the new campaign will officially get up and running on a Friday evening in August, when Liverpool host Bournemouth at Anfield as the reigning Premier League champions on August 15.",
      "This also remains in line with the Premier League's return to a later start date after several years of slightly earlier restarts. Next term will begin a full 11 days after the 2022-23 campaign got underway, though that was motivated by the Qatar World Cup interrupting the schedule midway through the calendar.",
      "It also means teams will have to play less football before the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Many have urged organisers to shut the transfer window before the season gets underway at all, though this timing still leaves clubs with a fortnight to do business after the campaign starts.",
      "The Premier League will continue to adhere to a more manageable workload for players in 2025/26. After being pressured to fall in line with the scheduling policies of countries like Germany and Spain, England's elite will also have more respite over the Christmas and New Year period.",
      "This means no two rounds will take place within 60 hours of each other, a decision made to ease the burden on players during a congested part of the calendar. It also means that for the second season in a row, there will be no fixtures played on Christmas Eve.",
      "Anticipation will also be high around this time of year as the winter transfer window returns. The opening for clubs to conclude mid-season business will open on January 1, 2026 and close on February 2.",
      "Between August and May, the Premier League will host matchdays across 33 weekends and five midweek rounds. It's also now guaranteed that players will have 83 clear rest days over the course of those nine months, where no games are played.",
      "The campaign will conclude with 10 simultaneous kick-offs on Sunday, May 24. This has been scheduled to leave enough time ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which gets underway on June 11."

      "Manchester City's Rayan Cherki thinks highly of Chelsea target and former Lyon team-mate Malick Fofana. The Blues have been linked with a host of wingers this window, including Manchester United's wantaway Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side are on the hunt for a wide player this summer, after Jadon Sancho returned to Old Trafford upon the expiration of his loan, with no permanent deal sealed. In January, rumours swirled that Red Devils star Garnacho could be on his way to west London, and while his agents were even spotted at Stamford Bridge amid alleged talks, the 20-year-old stayed put.",
      "With the transfer window back open, hints have been dropped that Garnacho will seek pastures new, with his personal photographer even suggesting via social media that he has played for United for the 'last time.'",
      "However, a move to Chelsea could rely on the Blues not pursuing other targets, and Lyon's Fofana is now reportedly on their radar and has been given a glowing review by former team-mate and new City signing Cherki.",
      "Fofana arrived in Ligue 1 from Gent last year. At just 20, he recorded 11 goals and six assists this campaign, proving particularly prolific in the Europa League, in which he found the back of the net six times.",
      "The Belgian talent has attracted attention from not just the Blues, but Liverpool, United and Nottingham Forest, according to L'Equipe, though the City Ground is supposedly not his desired destination. He is valued at £42.5million.",
      "In 2024, when Fofana was being fleetingly integrated into Lyon's first team, Cherki, who completed a £30m transfer to the Etihad this summer, spoke highly of his peer.",
      "\"Malick Fofana? I like everything about him,\" admitted Cherki. \"He's good, kind, not very handsome (laughs), but who cares. He brings us his explosiveness.",
      "\"We tell him to go into spaces because we can give him the ball and he can hurt [opponents]. He has integrated well and is not afraid of much.\"",
      "Fofana has caught the eye of those around him plenty of times in the past. When he was starring for Gent in his native Belgium, the club's under-21 coach, Emilio Ferrera, described him as the best talent he'd ever seen.",
      "\"When I started as a coach of the youth team at Gent, I quickly knew that Malick was the greatest talent I ever trained,\" Ferrera admitted. \"He can explode a match on his own.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, Chelsea have made initial contact with Lyon over signing Fofana, and plenty of names on their wishlist could also be pursued with vigour this summer, Garnacho perhaps included.",
      "Borussia Dortmund wide player Jamie Gittens was subject to a rejected £42m offer earlier this month, with the German club seeking £50m for his services.",
      "Chelsea hoped to sign the English winger before Maresca's side jetted off for the Club World Cup, and while no deal was completed, a revised approach is not out of the question.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "An astonishing attack from Sir Alex Ferguson about Manchester United's fixture list prompted the Premier League to release their own statement in 2009. The official list of matches and their dates for the 2025/26 campaign will be released on Wednesday at 9am.",
      "The huge schedule details the rough plan of the 380 games that will be played between the 20 clubs in the top flight of English football. Premier League officials state the list is always randomised and put together by an outside IT company called Atos.",
      "However, after being left unhappy by a run of matches at the start of 2009, Ferguson tore into the Premier League's fixture list and insinuated that they tried to make life difficult for the Red Devils. In the 2008/09 campaign, United had to face nine of the 10 teams who finished directly below them the previous season away in the first half of the campaign.",
      "He was also aggrieved that his team had to play on the road straight after United's three Champions League away clashes at the time. In a pre-match press conference previewing an FA Cup third-round tie away to Southampton, the Scot tore into the Premier League.",
      "He said: \"I’ve been saying this for a few months, but our fixture programme didn’t do us any favours. I think we have been handicapped by the Premier League. They tell me it’s not planned - bloody hell!”",
      "When asked if he felt the Premier League wanted to disadvantage United, he added: \"I’ve got my doubts. I’m not saying what they do down there.",
      "\"But next year we’ll be sending somebody to see how it happens, I can assure you. I just don’t understand how you can get the fixtures like that.”",
      "The previous summer, United did have the opportunity to raise objections to the Premier League about the fixture list but chose not to. Officials from the division refuted Ferguson's comments with a strong statement.",
      "\"The police also approve it before it is sent to the clubs, at which point they can raise any objections they may have. There are various factors that go into the structuring of the fixture list - police requests, club requests, involvement in European or FIFA competitions for example - but the overriding factor is the luck of the draw.”",
      "Despite the tricky fixture scheduling, United were able to win the Premier League, pipping Liverpool to the title by four points. Throughout that era, Ferguson was far from the only person who was sceptical about the scheduling.",
      "At the start of the 2005/06 campaign, Jose Mourinho, who was beginning his second season at Chelsea at the time, told the People newspaper: \"It is always Chelsea who get the worst games, the worst fixtures to play, while Arsenal always have the best ones.\"",
      "His comments were said after the reveal of the fixture list, which had Chelsea down to play away from home immediately after their first five Champions League games, while the Gunners had home matches after their European clashes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

The Reds are not resting on their laurels and have launched a major recruitment drive, with Jeremie Frimpong already having arrived, while Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez are set to follow.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is steadily progressing. Boss Ruben Amorim is looking to enact a major overhaul at Old Trafford following a miserable season that left them 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a deal worth around £63million. Further investment is needed though if Amorim is to turn around his reign after a dismal time in charge so far.",
      "High up his list is a new striker, but top target Liam Delap has snubbed a move to Old Trafford to instead join Chelsea. And the Red Devils have received a fresh setback with another target making it clear he will not be joining Amorim's squad.",
      "That comes as United chief executive Omar Berrada insisted that he has full confidence in the club's plans for the summer window. Berrada believes that Amorim has a clear vision that will be a success.",

      "Before that, the 39-year-old had successful spells at Bristol City, Burnley and Aston Villa, earning regular call-ups to the England national team. He had been set to be out of contract this summer.",
      "But Heaton is now close to putting pen to paper on a new deal which will keep him at Old Trafford until next summer. The decision has been approved by Amorim and his coaching staff.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed the club will be busy for the rest of the summer window. Berrada has overseen a massive cost-cutting process over the past year.",
      "Despite that, he has told The United Stand that the Red Devils will be 'active' over the summer. He also backed the 'vision' Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox share for the direction of the club.",
      "“We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting,” Berrada added. “I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.”",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kauã Santos has insisted he will snub a move to Manchester United. Santos featured in 14 games this season before suffering a major injury and has a contract running for another five years, though United have grown interested in him.",
      "“The people in charge in Frankfurt have shown enormous trust in me. They wanted to continue working with me before these rumours even surfaced. They still have a lot of faith in me here, so it was clear to me that I wanted to extend my contract,\" he told Die Welt.",
      "\"I want to establish myself as a goalkeeper, perform well, and achieve as much as possible. I’m not busy with anything else at the moment, because my entire focus is on Eintracht Frankfurt.”"

      "Manchester United will have to wait until transfer deadline day if they want to land midfield target Hicham Boudaoui. The Algerian international is the latest name to emerge as a potential solution to Ruben Amorim's midfield issues ahead of the new season.",
      "United boss Amorim has acted quickly to strengthen his front-line, with Matheus Cunha completing a £62.5million move from Wolves. Midfield remains a problem area, though, after a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro's tough time in English football continued last term, while Amorim seems determined to use Kobbie Mainoo in a more advanced role and hasn't appeared eager to play Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte as a two. Alternatives are being eyed, and 25-year-old Boudaoui is among those to catch the eye.",
      "According to The Sun, United sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Algeria against Sweden. It was a game to forget for Boudaoui despite some positive flashes, though, with the visitors 4-0 down when he went off on the hour mark before pulling back three late goals.",
      "Boudaoui has two years left on his current deal with Nice, but has been tipped to leave this summer. Due to United's ownership situation, though, a move may have to wait.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is understood to be waiting until September before making any signings from Nice, who are also owned by Ineos. United and Nice were both involved in last season's Europa League, with a United move for Jean-Clair Todibo made impossible by the situation.",
      "“They’ve said we can sell him to another Premiership club, but we can't sell to Manchester United. But that's not fair on the player and I don’t see what that achieves,\" Ratcliffe told Bloomberg. Todibo eventually completed a season-long loan move to West Ham and has now joined the London side permanently.",

      "Nice finished last season in fourth place in Ligue 1, narrowly missing out on automatic qualification for the Champions League's league phase. They still have a chance to make it into the competition through the qualifying rounds, where they will need to come through two two-legged matches.",

      "After their worst-ever Premier League finish, the notion of Manchester United being crowned champions any time soon is as fanciful as it is laughable. United finished last season in 15th place, but chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028 – if not before.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the bold aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary.",
      "But after the shambles of last season, when United suffered 18 league defeats, failed to get beyond the quarter-finals of both domestic cups and lost the Europa League final to ensure no European football next term, the situation is as bleak as it has ever been in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "Despite that, Berrada is confident with boss Ruben Amorim in charge, the right player recruitment and stability off the field in terms of the club's finances, United can reach the top again within three years.",
      "Asked if winning the title in that timeframe was realistic, Berrada told",
      "\"Of course. We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?",
      "\"I firmly believe that we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy — and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",
      "Berrada added: \"Project 150 is a very simple idea. We're going to celebrate our 150th anniversary in June 2028, an important milestone in the history of the club. It's a way of setting a time-bound period where we're going to focus our efforts to achieve certain goals.",
      "\"All we're saying is we're setting ourselves a target with a specific timeframe to go and aim for because if you just said 'we want to win the Premier League' - great, but by when? So this way, again it's from the ownership to management, to everybody in the club, we have a target, we have a mission and that's what we want to achieve.\"",
      "Berrada admitted appointing Amorim a third of the way through last season was always likely to bring difficulties, given his insistence on playing a 3-4-3 formation unfamiliar to the players he inherited from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But Berrada said United were willing to accept short-term pain for long-term gain, in the knowledge 40-year-old Portuguese coach Amorim is the right man to lead the club back to its former glory days.",
      "\"We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform,\" Berrada added.",
      "\"We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League. So by the time that we got to now, we’d have had all the discussions about what the squad needs and the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that’s capable of winning the Premier League.",
      "\"We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.",
      "'I firmly believe in Ruben as a coach and what he’s trying to do. We’ve taken all the short-term pain this season but, as of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us.",
      "\"I’m actually very optimistic and quite positive about what’s ahead. Of course we need to get a lot of decisions right and we will make mistakes, there’s no doubt. We’ll try to minimise those. But what we want is to build something that’s sustainable for the long, long term.",

      "Sadio Mane once said “never say never” to the idea of joining Newcastle. The Liverpool legend, now playing for Al-Nassr, also admitted previously that he agreed a contract with Manchester United but opted for their Merseyside rivals instead.",
      "Mane, now 33, became a legend at Anfield following his £34million move from Southampton in 2016, scoring 120 goals and providing 46 assists during his six-year stint.",
      "He played a crucial role in Jurgen Klopp's successful rebuild, helping the Reds win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup.",
      "His departure to Bayern Munich for an initial £27m in 2022 was undoubtedly a loss for the English top flight. But the door opened for his return less than 12 months later.",
      "The Senegalese icon’s time in Germany was marred by an injury before the Qatar 2022 World Cup and a reported dressing room fight with team-mate Leroy Sane. It was therefore unsurprising that he was shown the exit door at the end of the season.",
      "It was during that uncertain period that he met Martin Callanan, a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords who is originally from Newcastle. Callahan was attending an EITI International conference in Mane's native Senegal.",
      "He encouraged Mane to join the Magpies, saying in a later tweet: “I’m in Senegal speaking at ⁦the EITI⁩ conference. Honoured to meet ⁦Sadio Mane in the hotel. I couldn’t resist asking him about coming to Newcastle next season. His enigmatic reply: ‘Never say never!’\"",
      "It's unclear whether Mane was merely being courteous or if Newcastle were serious contenders to secure his signature, but he didn't end up at St James Park. Instead, he joined Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, where he's contributed to 62 goals in 93 matches.",
      "While many who have made similar moves to the Middle East have been accused of chasing money, that record suggests Mane's far from just going through the motions. And his response to Callahan implies a Premier League return may not be completely off the cards, unlike most who are spending the twilight years of their career on Saudi shores.",
      "However, considering his age and the fact that there's still a year left on his contract, the likelihood of a move to Tyneside can probably be categorised in the \"never\" bracket now. While he might still view the switch as desirable, it's hard to imagine the feeling being mutual - though he is being rumoured with an exit from Al-Nassr this summer.",
      "Mane is no stranger to a sudden change in transfer plans. Before joining Liverpool, he was all set to head to Old Trafford until a phone call from Klopp turned his head.",
      "Mane recalled in an interview with the Telegraph: \"I was really close to going to Manchester United. I had the contract there. I had it all agreed. It was all ready, but instead, I thought, 'No, I want to go to Liverpool.'",
      "\"I was convinced to go with Klopp's project. I still remember the first time I got the call from Klopp. He said, 'We have a big project at Liverpool and I want you to be part of it.'\"",

      "Jack Grealish looks set to be on his way out of Manchester City - and Pep Guardiola is reportedly preparing to offer him up in a straight swap for Real Madrid ace Rodrygo. The out-of-favour winger has spent most of the 2024/25 season on the Etihad Stadium bench, making just seven appearances in City's starting XI during the Premier League campaign.",
      "In 20 total appearances in the league, Grealish scored once and assisted one altogether. The lack of form meant that the England international has been left out of City's Club World Cup squad and will not feature in their opening game against Wydad AC on Wednesday at 5pm.",
      "Guardiola is keen to limit the losses on the £100million man, with City reportedly interested in Real's Rodrygo in a potential swap deal. Defensa Central reports that the Spanish manager has asked the club to utilise Grealish with the 'idea of lowering the price for the Brazilian' winger this summer.",
      "However, these plans may be squashed before they begin, as UOL reports that new Real boss Xabi Alonso is 'counting on the young Brazilian and, therefore, is against a transfer this summer'.",
      "Guardiola has got other options for Grealish, as we reported that Serie A champions Napoli are in the running for the winger's signature.",
      "Grealish is subject of interest from the Italian side, but his hefty £300,000-per-week wages may create a barrier in the deal transpiring. As well as this, other reports suggest that Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho is on their radar.",
      "Garnacho may cause an issue with Grealish's potential move to Italy this summer, as Napoli may opt for a younger star out wide in the 20-year-old, rather the man nine years his senior.",
      "Napoli have already been shopping in the Manchester this summer, snapping up long-time City servant Kevin De Bruyne on a two-year deal following his emotional exit from the club.",
      "There are more clubs reportedly interested in bringing Grealish on a loan move. Newcastle, Everton and Tottenham may all be prepared to give the winger a chance next season.",
      "A sensational return to his boyhood club Aston Villa could may well be an option for Grealish, and he wouldn't be the first big-money player to enjoy a homecoming in the Premier League.",
      "Spurs icon Gareth Bale was given a final season at his old club in the 2020/21 season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions - and these statistics could be a welcoming sight for Grealish if he does plan on moving permanently from the Etihad Stadium in the future.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Club World Cup, Guardiola admitted that Grealish does require more game time, but this doesn't mean it will be with his current club in the near future. The City boss said: \"Of course, Jack has to play. He’s an unbelievable player that has to play football every three days. It didn’t happen this season and last season either. He needs to do it, with us or another place.",

      "Amorim has already begun reshaping his United squad this summer following the arrival of Matheus Cunha for £62.5m. Bryan Mbeumo is also anticipated to join from Brentford despite Thomas Frank's reported interest in taking the winger with him to Tottenham.",
      "Saunders has cautioned United that signing players with the right mentality will be crucial in the transfer window. It follows Amorim falling out with both Garnacho and Marcus Rashford this season.",
      "He said: \"Man United have signed bad characters, and you've got to start signing good characters. Forget the talent.",
      "\"Obviously, you've got to have a certain amount to play at the level you're at, but they've got to concentrate on signing good characters, because they're shambolic at the moment.\"",
      "Garnacho himself is said to have expressed a preference for staying in the UK if he does move this summer. Chelsea are among the teams most heavily linked with a bid to sign him, while Arsenal and Aston Villa are also believed to have shown an interest.",
      "His old club Atletico Madrid have also been associated with him, along with Bayer Leverkusen following Erik ten Hag's appointment as manager. Any fee received for Garnacho would represent a pure profit for United as he's considered as a homegrown player.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Arsenal, who have now finished second in the last three campaigns, are hoping to win their first title since 2004 and Manchester City will also be looking to bounce back after a disappointing campaign.",
      "It will be the first full season with semi-automated offside technology after that was introduced during the last campaign, while Puma will be the official match ball supplier after it was announced that they would be replacing Nike.",

      "What time are the fixtures released?",
      "The schedule will be announced 9am BST.",

      "Before last season, the Premier League told supporters that they are \"committed to giving supporters a minimum of six weeks' notice on UK broadcast selections until December 2024, and five weeks' from January 2025 until Matchweek 37.\"",
      "Who has the rights to TV games this year?",
      "How is the Schedule produced?",
      "The Premier League say that putting together the schedule, in full, takes up to six months. It is a process that is managed by an IT company, Atos, whose main headquarters are based just outside of Paris.",
      "An AI system has all manner of information concerning the football calendar thrown into it - including European dates, international games, domestic cup competitions and also what lower league schedules look like - as well as concerns such as geography and policing concerns.",
      "Clubs are then placed into a pairing grid - for example, Aston Villa and Wolves are often paired opposite one another, so when Villa are at home, Wolves are away - which will define when they play at home and when they’ll head away and the system thus randomises a set of fixtures for all 20 clubs.",
      "Those fixtures are then manually verified by Atos staff before being verified further by representatives of the Premier League and Football League. Any issues, and the process is repeated until a new set of fixtures are generated which meet the requirements.",

      "And if it is to become a reality this transfer window needs to see a shambolic squad that finished 15th in the season just completed receive some significant surgery. It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",
      "Yet United have been clear for months that outgoings are a must to fund new arrivals and there is still no clarity on where Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and several others will be playing once the recruitment window closes on September 1. None of those are in head coach Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "Here is the transfer state of play at Old Trafford after the window reopened on Monday.",
      "Cunha's arrival from Molineux, on a five-year deal with the option to extend by another 12 months, brings justifiable excitement considering how impressive the Brazil forward performed in the middle part of the season for a club that began the campaign worried about relegation.",
      "A deal to sign young left back Diego Leon from Paraguay's Cerro Porteno was confirmed in January.",
      "Having scored a pitiful 44 goals in 38 league games, with both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee devoid of confidence, strengthening the attack has been an obvious priority.",
      "And that is why United are so keen on £70m Mbeumo , who looks almost certain to leave Brentford following another impressive season for the top flight's smartest run club. The big issue is whether Mbeumo instead chooses to follow his Bees boss Thomas Frank in joining Tottenham Hotspur - where he can be guaranteed of Champions League football.",
      "A similar fee will be required to bring in French striker Ekitike , 22, from Frankfurt - despite him having only one decent season in the Bundesliga under his belt. Ekitike could not make an impact at Paris Saint-Germain, albeit in their galacticos era, with Mbeumo the far safer bet for a club that has counted the cost of bringing in players with no Premier League experience.",

      "The entire squad is available for the right price but there are several who clearly have no roles to play under Amorim.",
      "Rashford shone in parts while on loan at Aston Villa and has been linked with a switch to Barcelona but only a select few clubs can afford his £1m a month salary.",
      "Similar is true of Antony, who did well at Real Betis. Except the La Liga club cannot afford the Brazilian’s wages either.",
      "Garnacho , meanwhile, was supposedly told to find a new club after a row because he was left on the bench for much of the nightmare Europa League defeat to Tottenham last month.",

      "Angry Ginge continued his running feud with Carlos Tevez by labelling the football legend a \"f***ing traitor\" after their Soccer Aid clash. Popular streamer Angry Ginge, real name Morgan Burtwistle, lived out his childhood dream of playing on the Old Trafford turf during Sunday's charity game.",
      "The lifelong United fan played in defence for England during Soccer Aid 2025, which meant he faced former Red Devils striker Tevez, who represented the World XI.",
      "Tevez won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with United but infamously joined rivals Manchester City in 2009. He instantly became a loathed figure at the Theatre of Dreams and severed all ties by celebrating against his former club during a Manchester Derby.",
      "That was evidently still fresh in Burtwistle's mind as the YouTuber saw his chance to get revenge during Sunday's friendly game, flying in with a crunching challenge on the Argentine.",
      "He got the ball but Tevez was left unhappy with the aggressive nature of the challenge and made sure to leave something on Ginge, slightly kicking out at the defender.",
      "Tevez quickly realised where he was and decided to then shake hands with the 23-year-old. For Ginge, however, the bad blood remained beyond the final whistle as he took to Instagram to post a photo of a nasty gash on his leg courtesy of Tevez.",
      "His caption read: \"Cheers Tevez, t***,\" echoing his thoughts on the Boca Juniors icon, having once admitted that he \"can't stand\" him. And he wasn't done there, later revealing on one of his live streams that he had his match-worn Soccer Aid shirt signed by everyone on both teams, except Tevez, who he slammed.",
      "The internet personality said: \"Look at that. Signed by every single person on the team. And the away team. Bar one man. The f***ing traitor. Tevez ain't signing my f***ing shirt. Not in a million years. No chance.\"",
      "Tevez had the last laugh, however, scoring four goals in just 15 minutes to lead the World XI's comeback. He was booed after each goal by the crowd but appeared to revel in his role as the pantomime villain, cupping his ear and pointing to the name on the back of his shirt.",
      "He managed to level the game, which paved the way for musician Big Zuu to score the late winner and secure a memorable 5-4 victory. Zuu emphatically celebrated with his own version of Cristiano Ronaldo's Siu celebration.",
      "Ginge, meanwhile, had the consolation of being awarded Player of the Match over Tevez. His tireless defensive work included diving across the goal to stop France World Cup winner David Trezeguet from scoring the equaliser.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, June 18.",
      "The summer transfer window is back up and running with clubs now able to go about their business freely again until the market closes for good on Monday, September 1. United have plenty of business to do both this week, and in the weeks to come.",
      "The club's top priority will be to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford amid ongoing negotiations with the Reds, having already spent big to bring in Matheus Cunha. Tottenham Hotspur have also shown an interest the Brentford forward following the appointment of his former head coach at the Bees, Thomas Frank, and the Cameroonian has given an update on his future.",
      "United however, will also have to sanction a number of departures in order to restore their place at England's top table, with the club already walking a tightrope in their battle with PSR.",
      "All United players are available to be sold in the summer window, for the right price, and thus Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all have suitors chasing their services.",
      "Keep across the United transfer updates in our blog below:",
      "Sport Bild claims Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Arsenal are the main players in the race to sign Xavi Simons this summer.",
      "The German outlet claims that the Premier League quartet are all interested in signing the Dutch playmaker who scored 11 goals and notched eight assists in 33 games for RB Leipzig last season.",
      "However, Simons has a reported €70m (£59.8m) asking price. That being said, the report claims the player's brother Faustino has been in talks with the Premier League clubs, along with Barcelona.",
      "Given how much United could spend on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, another big-money signing looks unrealistic.",
      "BILD have reported that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement' with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old has been the Gunners' top target this summer on the back of scoring 21 goals last season.",
      "The report in Germany claims that the Gunners have come to an agreement with the Slovenian on personal terms. There is still work to be done with Leipzig but it's suggested that the north Londoners have signalled they will make an offer that won't be below their £85.5m valuation.",
      "GiveMeSport claims Manchester United will rival Nottingham Forest for the signing of 25-year-old Palmeiras midfielder Richard Rios",
      "The midfielder has a reported release clause of around £85m and Nuno Espirito Santo's side are said to have scouting the Colombian international who is in action at the Club World Cup.",
      "It's not the first time United have been linked with a move for the midfielder, having been tipped to make a move for him back in 2024, while Spurs are also said to be keen.",
      "Transfer intermediary, Vincenzo Morabito, has told Manchester United they need to lower their asking price for Jadon Sancho this summer amid a reported interest from Italy and Saudi Arabia.",
      "United looked to have agreed a permanent departure for the England international last summer, agreed a loan deal with Chelsea which included an obligation to buy. However, the Blues look set to pay a reported £5m break clause and pass up on his transfer.",
      "It means United will have to offload the winger elsewhere with a reported £21.4m asking price on his head attracting interest from the likes of Napoli.",
      "Morabito told Radio CRC: \"Ruben Amorim has made it very clear he does not want Sancho or Marcus Rashford in pre-season training.",
      "\"Manchester United are going to have to lower their expectations for Sancho, because they cannot ask for €25m for a player who has one year left on his contract and earns €18m per season wages.",
      "\"This operation is feasible, but we need to see how tough Manchester United can be holding out here, because Sancho is a good player and did pretty well at Chelsea. Cristiano Giuntoli wanted to bring him to Juventus last year, but then it didn’t go through.\"",
      "The Sun claims that Manchester United have joined Roma and Napoli in the race to sign Nottingham Forest star Callum Hudson-Odoi. The 24-year-old played a key part in helping the Tricky Trees qualify for European football with five goals and three assists last season.",
      "However, the former Chelsea man is approaching the final year of his contract with the trio of clubs keen on his signature this summer. The report claims Forest have opened contract talks after Manchester United's January enquiries were rebuffed with a firm \"no.\"",
      "United are still said to be keeping a close eye on developments at the City Ground, with the two Serie A giants also keen. If Napoli were to sign the England youth international, then it would likely rule out a move for United star Alejandro Garnacho after January interest from Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Manchester United were one of the more active Premier League clubs during the first part of the summer transfer window and will be looking to ramp up their business and strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad ahead of next season.",
      "With that in mind, here are some of your Reds headlines this morning on Wednesday, June 18:",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a whole host of strikers this summer as they look to solve their goal scoring woes. Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike have all been tipped for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Ekitike, one option that emerged was Bayer Leverkusen forward Victor Boniface.",
      "The Nigerian international joined the German side two years ago from Belgian side Union SG and made an immediate impact at the BayArena.",
      "Despite picking up a major injury midway through his first season, his 21 goals and 10 assists helped Bayer on their way to winning the Bundesliga and DFB Pokal, as well as reaching the Europa League final.",
      "He backed that up with 11 goals this season while sharing game time with Patrik Shick and, still just aged 24, he has his best years ahead of him.",
      "Newly appointed Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso is a huge fan of Boniface and he is said to be available £42.7million this summer.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Hello and welcome back to another day of Manchester United news and transfers.",
      "We'll be bringing you the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day and with the window now reopen, all eyes will be on Ruben Amorim's summer rebuild.",
      "United are one of several clubs said to be interested in Malick Fofana.",
      "L'Equipe claims Chelsea have enquired with Lyon about the winger, while Liverpool are another Premier League team linked. However, the French club reputedly have an asking price of over €50million (£43million), more than they sold Rayan Cherki to Manchester City.",
      "United are reportedly one of as many as ten clubs scouting Richard Rios at the Club World Cup.",
      "GiveMeSport claims Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur are two teams interested in the Palmeiras player. CaughtOffside have previously stated it is their understanding that the midfielder has a €100m release clause, which the Brazilian club want to be paid in full.",
      "Caykur Rizespor reportedly have shown interest in Altay Bayindir after United put the goalkeeper 'on their sale list'.",
      "Fotomac reports that the manager has contacted representatives of Turkey's big four teams - Besiktas, Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor. However, the feedback received is said to have been negative.",
      "Bayindir, however, would reputedly rather remain in Europe than return to Turkey with a team outside of the top four. United signed the player from Fenerbahce, but he previously played for Ankaragucu.",
      "Pervis Estupinan reputedly wants to leave Brighton & Hove Albion and sign for United this summer.",
      "The club's former chief scout, Mick Brown, has told Football Insider:",
      "His agent has been making his availability known to a number of clubs, and from what I hear, he wants to join Man United. I think he's a decent player, but I don't think it's going to be a priority for them. Luke Shaw has got back to full fitness, and they're hopeful he can stay fit; they bought [Patrick] Dorgu in January, and they've got Harry Amass coming through as well.",
      "Their priorities are at centre-forward and in midfield, so I don't expect them to move for Estupinan. He's a player they wanted previously, and I'm sure he's still got admirers, but unfortunately for him, they look to have moved on.",
      "Ethan Wheatley scored for England this evening to help them come from 5-1 down to draw 5-5 with Germany at the European Under-19 Championship.",
      "The teenage United striker scored soon after Said El Mala made it five early in the second half. Barely ten minutes later, the Young Lions were level, with Reiss-Alexander Russel-Denny, Zach Abbott and Jesse Derry scoring to salvage a point in Bucharest, Romania.",
      "United have reportedly held talks over signing Roony Bardghji.",
      "TBR Football claims the Copenhagen player is due to leave this summer with mere months remaining on his contract that expires on New Year's Eve. Aston Villa, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Marseille, Newcastle United, Porto, RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur are also said to have discussed a deal for Bardghji.",
      "United have reportedly held talks with the representatives of Juventus centre-forward Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "FootballTransfers claims the player's camp approached United as their client is reputedly keen to make a dream move to the Premier League this summer transfer window. Their recent discussions are said to have been 'positive and constructive.'",
      "The former Chelsea player Florent Malouda believes ex-United midfielder Paul Pogba belongs in the Premier League, not at Monaco.",
      "I’ve seen the talk of Paul Pogba to Monaco, and I don’t think it’s the right move for him. I think Chelsea needs an experienced player, and Pogba has won the World Cup and the Europa League and knows the Premier League so well.",
      "I think he belongs in the Premier League. Honestly, I think he belongs in the Premier League.",
      "If he manages to get his fitness right, that is the first step. People underrate him because he has been away, but he would bring leadership.",
      "He is hoping to lead France at the World Cup, and I think a team like Chelsea or Arsenal should try and sign him; he is a very gifted player. He has a great mindset, and he has been resilient in his career and in his private life.",
      "He will want to get to the top, and his experience would be so valuable. All he does is overcome challenges, and with Chelsea, I think he could adjust very well to their dressing room.",
      "Florent Malouda was speaking on behalf of bet365 and their launch of the free-to-play Club World Championship Tournament Predictor game.",
      "Al-Hilal chief executive Esteve Calzada has remained coy over whether the Saudi Pro League club tried to sign Bruno Fernandes earlier this month.",
      "The club's CEO told the BBC:",
      "I cannot confirm nor deny that we've been interested in him. He's a big player; it fits the profile of player that we think would be good for Al-Hilal, just like many others.",
      "We're not refraining from contacting players because we feel they would say no to us. The names we are linked with demonstrate the ambition of the club. We believe that we are in a position to pitch [to] any players nowadays.",
      "The former Chelsea player Florent Malouda believes Bryan Mbeumo needs a shift of mentality to fulfil his potential and become a great player.",
      "For Bryan Mbeumo, it's about expectation. It's a great opportunity to play for Manchester United, but at the same time, we know that the context is not favourable.",
      "I would compare it to the situation at Real Madrid. A club with a big history, [United] still reached a European final [in the Europa League], but there are internal issues that you don't want to be involved with – you don't want to have the responsibility of fixing everything.",
      "You want to focus on your individual performance, but that will also depend on the collective and how things are going in terms of the balance of the team. Jadon Sancho is going back, so that is another choice that might impact your performance, but Mbeumo has the potential to be a great player if he can shift his mindset.",
      "He has been playing with not much expectation of winning trophies or competing for the Premier League; he is now about to join a big club with a big history, where it's usual to be high in the table. Mbeumo can do that, but he has to adapt his performances.",
      "Florent Malouda was speaking on behalf of bet365 and their launch of the free-to-play Club World Championship Tournament Predictor game.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly added Gabriel Sara 'to the transfer list' after following and watching the Galatasaray player.",
      "Fotomac, a Turkish online sports newspaper, also credits Inter with an interest in the midfielder. His club are reputedly willing to begin negotiating at around €30million (£26million) a year after paying around half that to Norwich City for the Brazilian.",
      "According to Football Insider, United are now in a position where they are willing to listen to offers for Mason Mount.",
      "It is claimed that there is a possibility now that Mount could be sold despite regaining his fitness for the Reds this season.",
      "MEN Sport has previously reported that United are willing to listen to offers for any of the players this summer.",
      "According to Football Insider, Emiliano Martinez continues to push for an exit from Aston Villa.",
      "The shot stopper bid an emotional farewell to the Villa fans after the last home match of the Premier League season and it is claimed his stance on an exit from Old Trafford has not changed.",
      "Martinez thought to be a player that United are looking at despite Onana looking set to remain in Manchester.",
      "Amid ongoing reports linking United with a move for Emi Martinez this summer, MEN Sport understands that Andre Onana is expected to stay at the club this summer.",
      "It is believed that Onana has been working hard to convince his fellow countryman Bryan Mbeumo to sign for the Reds.",
      "Onana is thought to have held a meeting last week with United officials where he was reassured that he shall remain at the club beyond this summer.",
      "The new Manchester United kit is draped over the mannequins in the Old Trafford Megastore. On the online store, a handful of players' names are pre-printed on the new shirt.",
      "Fernandes, Yoro, Martinez, Amad and Maguire are all featured. Safe choices. Ella Toone, Maya le Tissier and Grace Clinton also have that privilege.",
      "It would be remiss of United to proactively plug 'Hojlund 9'. Get 'Rashford 10' or 'Garnacho 17' at your peril. 'Sancho' and 'Antony 21' are not even listed on the online options.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "The Athletic understands that Real Betis remain keen to bring Antony to their club permanently this summer.",
      "Talks are understood to have taken place with United to find out what their stance is. MEN Sport understands that United are keen to sell the Brazilian winger.",
      "No offers have yet been made for Antony and there is a realisation that this one could take time to complete.",
      "In perhaps the biggest hint yet that Garnacho will be leaving, his personal photographer Konrad Borzy appeared to confirm that the Aregentine had made his last appearances for the club.",
      "Posting on Instagram a selection of photos of the winger in action, Borzy wrote:",
      "One last time in Manchester United red… Garnacho under the lens.",
      "After turning down a move to Al Hilal this summer, Galatasaray remain interested in Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Athletic understands that Osimhen's wage demands are not a problem for the Istanbul club.",
      "However, they would likely struggle to activate the forward's £63m release clause this summer and would need Napoli to soften their position.",
      "Now Football Insider have claimed that United are unlikely to pursue a summer deal for Ekitke.",
      "The 22-year-old is in high demand but the outlet has claimed that sources have told them that the price-tag for the France youngster.",
      "The transfer mystery continues.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have agreed a new deal for third choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton.",
      "It is understood this news has been shared with Amorim and his coaching staff.",
      "Heaton has reportedly signed a new one-year contract and the news will be confirmed soon.",
      "In an interview with United We Stand, the club's CEO Omar Berrada has spoken about the potential timeline for new additions to this squad this summer.",
      "Explaining the plan, he said:",
      "He [Matheus Cunha] was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly. Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, the interest in Sancho from Napoli is there but his wages could prevent a deal from happening.",
      "The structure of a deal is currently unknown but this will apparently not stop the Naples club trying for him.",
      "Sancho has just one year remaining on his deal at United."

      "Following their curtain-raiser against the Gunners, United will complete the opening month of the season with a trip to Fulham before facing newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford the following weekend. They will then travel to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City in just their fourth game of the season.",
      "With the fixtures now out in the open, MEN Sport has picked out six key dates you should add to your diary ahead of the 2025/26 campaign:",

      "United are winless in their last five Premier League clashes with the Gunners, last beating them in September 2022 at Old Trafford. On that occasion, goals from Marcus Rashford (2) and Antony sealed a 3-1 win.",
      "The first Manchester derby of the 2025/26 campaign will take place at the Etihad Stadium immediately after the first international break of the season. It is currently penciled in for a 3pm kick-off on Saturday, September 13, although that will almost certainly change for TV purposes.",
      "The two sides did not meet in the league until December last season, meaning the fact they will meet just four games into the new campaign is rather interesting. United won at the Etihad last term, coming from being to seal a very late 2-1 win.",
      "It will be the earliest they have met in a Premier League campaign since City beat United 2-1 at Old Trafford in September 2016.",
      "United and Liverpool will meet for the first time in 2025/26 immediately after the October international break, with the Reds scheduled to travel to Anfield on Saturday, October 18 for a 3pm kick-off.",
      "United produced one of their best performances of last season at Anfield, contributing to a very entertaining 2-2 draw after fears they would be beaten by the runaway Premier League leaders, who did their best to get the game on after snow had fallen.",
      "The return meeting between the two teams at Old Trafford will not take place until May, marking United's penultimate home game of the season. The contest is currently scheduled for a 3pm kick-off on Saturday, May 2.",

      "Prior to facing Newcastle, the Reds will face Aston Villa at Villa Park in their final game before Christmas on Saturday, December 20.

      "United concluded their 2023/24 campaign against the Seagulls at the Amex, winning 2-0 via goals from Diogo Dalot and Rasmus Hojlund. It meant they went into the following weekend's FA Cup final with a spring in their step.",

      "If this summer's transfer window has already taught us anything, it's that signing a striker is not going to be an easy task for Manchester United.",
      "After seeing top target Liam Delap join Chelsea, United have been left with no choice but to explore alternative avenues in their hunt for a goal-getter.",
      "Delap, despite not being the proven and established No.9 United are in such desperate need of this summer, was an attainable target due to the £30million release clause that had been inserted into his Ipswich Town contract following his arrival from Manchester City last summer.",
      "Delap scored 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League striker and was not light on suitors as a result. His release clause and his potential made him an attractive option.",
      "However, it goes without saying that United need a proven goalscorer this summer. They gambled on potential with Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 and did exactly the same with Joshua Zirkzee last year.",
      "Neither player arrived at Old Trafford with a proven goalscoring record and that is why United are in such desperate need of an established goalscorer for the third summer transfer window running. However, securing a proven goalscorer is an easier said than done task.",
      "United have been linked with a flurry of strikers in recent weeks, both domestically and abroad, including Jean-Philippe Mateta of Crystal Palace, Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, Napoli's Victor Osimhen and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and remaining hopeful of signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo for a potentially similar fee, United do not have a bottomless pit to turn to this summer in their quest to sign a No.9, meaning they may have no choice but to distance themselves from the more premium and luxurious names.",
      "Sporting want top dollar for Gyokeres, who has reportedly chosen Arsenal as his preferred destination, and Osimhen has set eye-watering wage demands. With that said, United may have to look further afield in their search for a centre-forward, and one name they could consider adding to their shortlist is Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth.",
      "The Norwegian, once of Palace, joined Atletico from La Liga counterparts Villarreal just under a year ago for a fee reportedly in the region of £30m and scored 24 goals in his debut season at the Metropolitano Stadium, meaning he has netted 50 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "Having scored 24 goals for Atletico in 2024/25, the idea of them selling the 29-year-old and for a reasonable price may feel somewhat fanciful. However, the Spanish outfit's attacking options also consist of Julian Alvarez, Antoine Griezmann and Angel Correa, meaning they are not short on options.",
      "Despite ending the season as Atletico's second highest goalscorer, only coming second to Alvarez, who netted 29, Sorloth did not play as prominent a role as he would have liked. Of his 35 La Liga appearances, 20 of them were via the bench.",
      "Despite proving to be effective as an impact player, scoring 12 league goals after coming off the bench, Sorloth will believe his exploits in front of goal would have been worthy of more opportunities as a starter. There is a chance he could become increasingly frustrated if he continues to be utilised as an impact substitute by Atletico boss Diego Simeone.",
      "At United, he would be a guaranteed starter amid their need for a goalscorer. After a disappointing stint at Palace between 2018 and 2020, the Norwegian has found his feet in Spain, scoring 74 goals in 182 games for Real Sociedad, Villarreal and Atletico combined.",
      "His record is by no means as impressive as Gyokeres' or Osimhen's, for example, but few would categorise him alongside those two as being among Europe's elite strikers.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "Nevertheless, his haul of 66 goals over the last three seasons is worthy of recognition. The elephant in the room is that he failed to cut it in England with Palace, scoring just once in 20 appearances, but he has developed and matured since arriving at Selhurst Park as a 22-year-old in 2018.",
      "With Cunha already in situ and Mbeumo being targeted, they would be able to help ease the burden on Sorloth and assist with United's attacking output.",
      "With no obvious answer to United's striker search currently available, Sorloth could be a suitable fit if the price is right."

      "Fofana enjoyed an impressive season for Lyon last term, scoring 11 goals in all competitions.",

      "Cunha is expected to add goals and creativity to United's attack after plundering an impressive 17 goals for Wolves in 2024/25.",
      "The 26-year-old will have aspirations of making an immediate impact in his debut season at Old Trafford. He is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 role in Ruben Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation, Cunha should be able to adapt to Amorim's methods and demands relatively comfortably. He is a specialist No.10 and is capable of making things happen.",
      "In his first interview as a United player that was released last Friday, Cunha opened up on how former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil's advice improved him as a player.",
      "Cunha said: \"At the time we changed the manager, he came in and told me, 'Matheus, I can only say to you, be a little bit more free'. He gave me all the confidence to play well.",
      "\"It was a little bit easier because I did well last season, 14 goals. I think I did this only because he came and said to me to be free, show yourself. They were important words for me. Coming from Atletico was a little bit hard.\"",
      "In charge at Molineux between August 2023 and December 2024, O'Neil got a consistent tune out of Cunha, with the former Atletico Madrid forward scoring 22 goals and registering 12 assists in 55 appearances under the 42-year-old.",
      "O'Neil's successor, Vitor Pereira, also managed to get the best out of Cunha, who scored nine goals and claimed three assists in 19 matches under his management.",
      "Establishing himself as a creative force, who thrives of both scoring and creating goals, it is hardly surprising United chief executive Omar Berrada is confident Cunha will be a player that gets United's supporters out of their seats.",
      "\"He's a player that I think fans are going to love,\" Berrada told United We Stand. \"We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "\"He's a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he's going to lift people off their seats.",
      "\"He's got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, Cantona-esque.\"",
      "With Berrada hopeful Cunha will bring entertainment to Old Trafford, the attacker's comments about how O'Neil took him to a different level by allowing him to play with the shackles off should offer an insight to Amorim on how to get the best out of him.",

      "The wage demands of Manchester United-linked striker Viktor Gyokeres have reportedly been revealed, though only because Juventus have burst onto the scene and are said to be well on their way to making an offer.",
      "Amid Ruben Amorim's search for a new striker to spearhead his United side, the speculation of a reunion with a familiar face has been incessant. Gyokeres was the scorer of 66 goals under the manager during 15 months together at Sporting CP, so the logic would be he resumes such a record at Old Trafford.",
      "But the process around the striker's exit has not been a simple one with 'fury' from the player himself over the actions of his club president, who had a frosty back-and-forth with his agent.",
      "Ultimately we are now said to be beyond that stage, and Sporting are ready to accept their No.9's move on the terms of a 'gentleman's agreement' below his €100m (£84m).",
      "Whilst Premier League rivals Arsenal have been the other team most-talked about at this stage, Corriere dello Sport now suggest Juventus are the new threat to watch out for.",
      "They explain how The Old Lady have seven players on their roster ready to be sold, including striker Dusan Vlahovic and midfielder Douglas Luiz. For that duo alone they wish to recoup €60m (£51m).",
      "They can then launch an €80m (£68m) offensive for Gyokeres, made up of a €70m (£59m) up front fee and €10m (£9m) worth of add-on bonuses.",
      "It is described as a 'complex web', but one 'worth weaving' due to the Sweden international's return of 97 goals over the past two seasons.",
      "Helping their cause has also been the past sales of Wojceich Szczesny, Federico Chiesa, Arthur Melo, Mattia De Sciglio and Tiago Djalo - all freeing up essential funds from Juve's wage bill.",
      "Their extra sales this summer means even more will be available, with the Italian publication adding that they will then be able to meet Gyokeres' expectation to earn €7.5m (£6.3m) per year as a player in Turin.",
      "That would equate to €145k (£120k) per week, and gives United their first indicator as how much Gyokeres may set them back in addition to the transfer fee involved.",
      "Scandinavian publication FotbollSkanalen add this would be a huge increase on the €2m (£1.7m) the 27-year-old takes home per year at Sporting.",
      "Finally, clearing up some discrepancies around the sell-on clause involved in the deal are Portuguese outlet A Bola.",
      "They understand that Sporting initially agreed to hand over 15 percent of their earnings from the future sale of Gyokeres to his former club, Championship club Coventry City.",
      "Last summer that dropped to 10 percent and although there were some reports that Coventry no longer had that agreement in play, they say it is still active and they still stand to make a 'significant' amount from the impending transfer.",
      "Meanwhile, Real Madrid are said to have turned down the chance to sign Gyokeres. According to The Athletic, Gyokeres was proposed to Real as they search for a new centre forward.",
      "But Los Blancos have decided against making a move. It's added that while Xabi Alonso's side 'like him', they ruled him out because of the potential cost and his demand to be a starter.",

Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and while he scored in the Conference League final against Real Betis, the winger's time at Stamford Bridge was largely considered underwhelming.",
      "At the end of this season, it was no surprise to see Sancho and Chelsea fail to reach personal terms on a new contract. Despite being obligated to purchase the 25-year-old, the Blues agreed to pay United £5m to allow him to return to Old Trafford.",
      "This was seen as bad news for United who are keen to sell Sancho permanently this summer and now face the task of finding him a new home. Fortunately, an escape route to Italy has opened for the winger with journalist Gianluca di Marzio insisting that Napoli are interested in the England international.",
      "Napoli lost Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG in the January transfer window and were unable to sign a replacement then as United rejected a bid for Alejandro Garnacho. It now seems that his teammate is an option for Antonio Conte albeit there is reportedly a hurdle for that signature.",

      "Napoli had a £40million bid for the player rejected in January, highlighting his value to the club. However, it's thought a £70m approach would be enough to secure his exit.",
      "As Garnacho inches closer to leaving Old Trafford, former Liverpool forward Dean Saunders explained how he had heard about disagreements between the player and Amorim, as they were said to have rowed about tactics at United's training ground.",
      "The former Wrexham and Wolves boss criticised the player's choice to confront his head coach, while also expressing admiration for his playing ability. However, Garnacho's character is something that certainly bothers Saunders.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Saunders said: \"I like him as a player. He plays with his heart on his sleeve, and there's a load of them who don't at Man United. But from a good source, I heard he's arguing with the manager on the training pitch about tactics. How old is he, 20? Just get on with it.\"",
      "The focus at United this summer is very much on making squad improvements, with Amorim already welcoming Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is also very much being hunted, despite Thomas Frank's desire to lure him to Tottenham.",
      "Saunders has warned United that focusing on players' mentalities is key when making future signings, following Amorim's well-publicised rows with Garnacho and Marcus Rashford this season.",
      "He added: \"Man United have signed bad characters, and you've got to start signing good characters. Forget the talent. Obviously, you've got to have a certain amount to play at the level you're at, but they've got to concentrate on signing good characters, because they're shambolic at the moment.\"",
      "Garnacho has expressed a desire to remain in the UK if he leaves United this summer. Chelsea are understood to be leading the chase, with Arsenal and Aston Villa among the others reportedly interested.",
      "His former club Atletico Madrid are also eyeing a move, alongside Bayer Leverkusen, who recently appointed Erik ten Hag as their new manager. Any transfer fee for Garnacho would mean pure profit for United as a result of his status as a homegrown talent."

      "Arsenal’s pursuit of Benjamin Sesko is stalling after the Gunners learned something they definitely already knew, while Man Utd are being used again…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Callum Hudson-Odoi – Nottingham Forest to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Forest have opened talks over a new deal for Hudson-Odoi while Roma, Napoli and United hover. All very convenient for his agent, that.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Napoli\nWe almost want this to happen just to see Antonio Conte’s head fall off by Christmas. We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli. And reports suggest he has no intention of lowering his demands. Another loan beckons.",
      "",
      "18) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Manchester United\nTottenham were linked with the Bournemouth attacker and now United apparently have him in their sights if Mbeumo chooses a reunion with Thomas Frank at Spurs. Eberechi Eze is also an alternative target. This is a long way from being a thing.",
      "",
      "",
      "16) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nWith Nico Williams preferring to join Barcelona, the Arsenal-Rodrygo links are resurfacing, The Brazilian is at the Club World Cup with Real Madrid but the Gunners’ interest is ‘genuine’ and ‘exploratory talks’ have taken place.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",
      "",
      "14) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "12) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation and the fact that the Brazilian’s mate says he wants to live in London. Hide all the maps, lads.",
      "MORE: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "",
      "11) Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Liverpool\nApparently, Liverpool are looking to offer Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to Napoli in exchange for the Nigeria striker. Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. Swap deals don’t happen anymore – unless they a PSR tickle – but this could actually work, if there’s any truth in it.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "9) 🔼 Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nThis appears to be gathering pace rather quickly. Atletico Madrid have made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £116.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga for everyone to get very worked up about. Regardless, we are now at the point of arranging a medical, which is set for Friday, apparently. Stand by your flight trackers, Reds.",

      "Inter Milan – swapped Clarence Seedorf for Francesco Coco\nOnly Clarence Seedorf could swap Inter for AC Milan and still remain respected by the Nerazzurri. He crossed the Milan divide in 2002, with Italy international Francesco Coco heading in the opposite direction. The right-footed left-back tried to usurp Paolo Maldini as the Rossoneri’s left-back, the daft b*stard.",
      "There’s no disgrace in failing to shift actual Paolo Maldini, but there also was no justification for Inter placing equal value on Coco and Seedorf, despite the Netherlands star having cost £20million just two years before.",
      "Milan got a decade’s worth of service out of Seedorf, who won two Serie A titles, a couple of European Cups and could probably still boss a midfield aged around 68. Coco spent his five years at Inter either injured, on loan, chasing the opposite sex – “naturally, women are among my thoughts” he said in an interview in 2001 – or trying to forge a TV career.",

      "According to Cannavaro, he was ‘ditched’ by Inter, regardless of his desire to stay. So he moved to Turin on the same deadline day as Zlatan Ibrahimovic – a decent day’s work by anyone’s standards – in exchange for reserve goalkeeper Fabian Carini, with both players supposedly valued at around 10million euros, despite Cannavaro having cost 23million euros two years before and Carini never having played in Juve’s first team.",
      "The centre-half shook off the injury problems he had suffered during his second season at Inter to establish himself as Italy’s World Cup-winning captain and one of the game’s finest defenders. He made 96 appearances in two seasons, winning the Ballon d’Or, before joining Real Madrid when the Calciopoli scandal saw Juve relegated to Serie B.",
      "Carini, despite being Uruguay No.1, made only four Inter appearances in three years. He had as much success usurping Francesco Toldo and Julio Cesar as he enjoyed trying to dislodge Gianluigi Buffon from the Juventus goal. Carini also failed to establish himself during a loan spell at Cagliari before moving to Spain to sit on Murcia’s bench.",

      "Barcelona – swapped Samuel Eto’o, Alexander Hleb on loan +£40million for Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nThis one certainly didn’t go as Barcelona expected when they presented Zlatan, the previous season’s highest scorer in Serie A, as their new striker in July 2009.",
      "Zlatan couldn’t get along with Pep Guardiola. After Barca lost to Ibra’s old Inter side in the 2010 Champions League semi-final, the striker revealed how he confronted his coach.",

I thought, ‘there is my enemy, scratching his bald head!’ I yelled: ‘You haven’t got any b***s!’ and worse than that I added: ‘You can go to hell!’ I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he’s a spineless coward.”",

After falling out with Guardiola having not played regularly since leaving Arsenal, the Belarusian winger decided a year – possibly longer had Inter taken up their option to buy for £9million – under Mourinho wasn’t for him so he joined Stuttgart instead.",

      "For his enormous, record-breaking salary, Sanchez brought five goals in 45 appearances. The Chilean didn’t fancy it and boy did it show.",
      "“The first training I had I realised many things,” he reflected after being allowed to join Inter for free. “I came home and I told my representative: ‘Can’t the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?’ They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me.”",
      "Mkhitaryan scored more goals in fewer appearances for Arsenal before he was shipped off to Italy. But the Armenian was no trouble. Arsenal shifted Sanchez – who they looked set to lose for free – while taking a useful squad player. United saddled themselves with a huge liability.",

      "The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has 93 goals and 19 assists in 103 appearances for Al-Nassr, but it has been suggested that he is unhappy at the Middle East club after they finished third in the Saudi Pro League and lost in the AFC Champions League semi-finals",
      "It has also been claimed that he was being lined up for a move to Al-Nassr’s rivals, Al-Hilal, so he can compete in this month’s Club World Cup and he reportedly received a ‘powerful offer’ to join them for the tournament.",

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start.",
      "Berrada and Man Utd‘s other board members have come under intense scrutiny since joining the Premier League giants as they reached an embarrassing new low in 2024/25, finishing 15th and failing to win a trophy.",
      "The Red Devils made a mistake last summer as they retained Erik ten Hag, who was sacked a few months into the 24/25 season.",
      "United identified Amorim as their top target after he was linked with Liverpool and Man City and he was appointed mid-season, even though he was initially against leaving Sporting Lisbon for the Premier League before the summer.",
      "United’s performances under Amorim were worse than under Ten Hag as he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation and Berrada has revealed what he “underestimated” about their start under the head coach.",

      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Spurs eye another Man Utd target, Sancho to land on his feet again?",
      "“We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give Ruben time to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League.",
      "“We have a very clear roadmap. Had Ruben started on 1 July 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel about these seven or eight months that he’s had in the Premier League and what he’s suffered in the Premier League. And the team has suffered. It’s really going to help us in the future.",
      "“I couldn’t have said that we were going to finish 15th. That was never the goal. I think we probably underestimated the time it would have required the team to adjust to the system. But we don’t regret the decision because I’m convinced that we’ll see this pay off next season.”",
      "Despite this, Berrada has explained Man Utd’s bold “target” to win the Premier League “by 2028”.",
      "“Project 150 is a very simple idea,” Berrada claimed.”We’re going to celebrate our 150th anniversary in June 2028, an important milestone in the history of the club.",
      "“It’s a way of setting a time-bound period where we’re going to focus our efforts to achieve certain goals: winning the Premier League, having the women’s team win the first WSL, becoming one of the most commercially innovative clubs in the world, as we have been in the past, being cash positive.",
      "“We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men’s first team but we are committed to making the women’s team very successful. You’ve heard Jim say, if you’re wearing the United shirt then you must win, and that’s exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and to contribute to women’s football.",
      "“Overall, it’s establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. And if you ask me today, can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "“We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power? There have been other turnarounds and other big teams have had bad seasons and gone on to win the Premier League or La Liga.”",
      "He added: “I firmly believe that we can do it (win the Premier League in 2028).",
      "“We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy, and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",

      "That could give United hope that a move for the midfielder – who scored seven goals and assisted two more last term – could move there.",
      "That said, there is competition from Napoli, and they could have the best chance of landing Frattesi. Antonio Conte is said to have identified the midfielder as a ‘priority’ and Frattesi himself is ‘prioritising’ Serie A, as he’d rather stay in Italy than leave.",
      "That would seemingly put the Italian champions at the top of his list.",
      "A potential United exit could help their cause, though. The Dane has been a target of Inter for a while, and it’s been reported recently that he is ‘ahead of everyone’ on their priority list and there has been an ‘acceleration’ for the transfer of late.",

      "",
      "9) Milos Kerkez (£45m)\nAnother domino fell in The Great Left-Back Transfer Exchange when Bournemouth completed the signing of Adrien Truffert from Rennes, who themselves have brought in Lilian Brassier to help cover a side vacated by their erstwhile captain.",

      "“A lot of times I watched Kevin but another player I can learn a lot of things from is Gundogan. It is nice to see him up close and see how he does it,” said Reijnders of a more apt comparison. But it feels as though Kovacic has the most to lose in this sudden midfield evolution at the Etihad.",

      "But that might well be where his Chelsea odyssey ends, considering Liam Delap proved his almost immediate suitability to the Enzo Maresca cause in a way many have struggled before him.",

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "Arsenal have reportedly taken an important step in their pursuit of a star striker, having ‘reached an agreement’ over personal terms, with optimism evident around securing the deal.",
      "With Liverpool linked with Victor Osimhen in the kind of swap deal we don’t see enough of these days, we got to thinking of exchanges in years gone by…",
      "Arsenal ‘remain in contact’ with Benjamin Sesko’s representatives but are ‘not willing’ to meet RB Leipzig’s asking price, according to reports.",
      "Put yourself in Andrea Berta’s shiny, handcrafted brogues and tell us which striker you would sign for Arsenal this summer…",
      "A new report has revealed Arsenal’s striker “priority” during this summer’s transfer window, with a journalist revealing what he’s “known for a month”.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘opened a direct channel’ as they look to sign Napoli star Victor Osimhen in a ‘sensational swap deal’."

      "Ever since Sky created skybet and started blasting transfer drama into our brains to increase betting action I feel like people have lost the ability to talk about the issue sensibly. Now people have to win or lose at transfers.",

      "If the answer is yes then he’s worth it, regardless of price. If Rayan Cherki ends up doing skills on the edge of the pitch and losing the ball when City are 1-0 (like he often did at Lyon) he will feel like wasted money even though it was a small fee. If Wirtz scores the winner in a Champions League final it will feel worth it. That’s just how it works.",
      "If the player does the job they were brought in to do he’s worth it. Allison for example was brought in for an enormous price because we hadn’t had a keeper who can stop one on ones and distribute the ball well in a decade, Allison did that and much more so nobody ever talks about the price.",
      "If a player doesn’t do the job they’re brought in to do, they’re not worth it. Liverpool don’t have too many of these anymore but Nunez and Naby Keita are two that spring to mind who weren’t worth it.",
      "And it largely doesn’t matter what the price was. If Nunez cost £1 he still didn’t score enough goals so he would still not be worth it. If Van Dijk cost £200m he still led the team to many trophies and did all the things we needed him to do, so he would still be worth it.",
      "Is any United fan really gonna tell me that if Antony cost a quid they believe he would be a good players who brings something to the team it doesn’t already have? If Jack Grealish didn’t cost £100m would he be a better player for City?\nLee",

      "Declan Rice: Overrated\nI wanted to share some opinions on Declan Rice. First of all, he seems like a great bloke, and a footballer you’d definitely want to have a pint with. However he isn’t good enough to play DM for England or Arsenal.",
      "Some Arsenal fans have this weird obsession with comparing their players with Rodri. I was told Partey was better than Rodri after the former joined Arsenal in 2020 (he wasn’t). And then they repeated the trick when announcing that Rice is better than Rodri after Arsenal signed him in 2023. Partey was now, no longer worthy of comparison strangely. And I bet that they will say that Zubimendi is better than Rodri if he signs for Arsenal as planned.",
      "The weirdest bit is that Arteta doesn’t play Rice at DM. He played Partey or Jorginho instead, and has bought Zubimendi, as he knows Rice isn’t good enough to play DM at a team that wants to compete at the highest level. So it makes no sense to compare Rice to Rodri, when Rice is a box to box number 8 now, that compliments his physical strengths.",
      "If we assume that Tuchel will end up playing 4-3-3, as most of the English players he can pick play in that formation I find it weird how high Rice is rated in the England Ladder.",
      "When Rice played DM for England at the Euros, the back 4 ended up playing the ball left and right in a horseshoe shape as Rice wasn’t showing for the ball. He pretty much man marked the opposition and took himself out of the game. He wasn’t on the half turn, he didn’t get into space quick enough when pressed and his first touch isn’t good enough. As a result England couldn’t transition from defence to midfield when pressed. What England need is a proper DM for that role. We tried Angel Gomes and I still have hopes for Wharton, but we need someone who can play that role properly.",
      "Then England need two other midfielders and this is where Rice should play. But if everyone was fit and on form, and with a proper DM, would Rice be in the team ahead of all but one of Bellingham, Palmer, Foden, Eze, Rogers or Mainoo? Bellingham, when not being stroppy, provides the physicality that Rice does, so there should be a space for a more creative player next to him. Personally, I’d choose Palmer, so I’m surprised that Rice is number 3 on the ladder.",
      "TL;DR – Rice seems like a nice bloke, but isn’t a DM, shouldn’t be compared to Rodri, and shouldn’t play DM for England, and has a battle IMO to keep his England place in a midfield 3 if everyone is fit.\nAndy D. Manchester. MCFC",

      "Just look at their faces…\nAll this talk about which trophies are considered ‘worth’ winning and which aren’t is utterly pointless. All you have to do is look at the players when they win whatever trophy it is and that will tell you whether it’s ‘worth’ it or not. FA Cup, Coca-Cola Cup, Charity Shield, Super Cup…..the players that win those trophies quite clearly think they are worth winning.",

No one’s amazed that Trent can speak Spanish (it is after all one of the easier languages to learn – not if you’re Gareth Bale tho). No Johnny, what people were shocked by was it was so clean & without flaws that it clearly meant that he’d been learning it for quite some time – let’s say a lot longer than when Real first approached Liverpool back in January. Which means his decision to join Real has probably been taken long time ago & he could’ve even met privately with people from the club to discuss a potential move, whilst firmly a contracted Liverpool player.",
      "I think that will be the real kicker for Liverpool fans – it’s not like he’s had his head turned in January by Real’s interest but that he’s probably been sounded out by people at Madrid several years ago & he’s just allowed his contract to run down.",
      "Up the Wahs.\nPeter Stone",

      "However it is surprising seeing and English or American person speaking a second language because that really isn’t so common. I’d go a little further and say that in Trent’s case the consternation stems from him being Scouse.",
      "Those of us whose first language is English tend to be a little bit….entitled and carry an expectation that people will speak English because it’s the sort of international language. I’ve travelled most of the world and I’ve English, Americans and australians all in foreign countries just using English with little to no attempt at the local language. This isn’t just my opinion either, the locals I speak to on my travels are always surprised when I can speak their language (Portuguese, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese in case you’re curious) and they’re surprised because English speaking people don’t usually make the effort.",
      "And I confess in my teenage school years I did not bother with french because had the naive opinion that “everywhere speaks English anyway.”",
      "I currently reside in Brasil and local faces light up when they learn I’m not a brasileiro and speak it well. In fact the only places where people don’t seem to appreciate that effort is Paris (where they have actual disdain if you attempt french and would rather you use English) and in the UK where people swat someone attempt at English aside like it’s a simple thing.",

      "The report claims Amorim is ‘desperate to bring players with a more physical profile to the Old Trafford and Boudaoui certainly fits the bill’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Boudaoui is coming off an excellent season in France in which he emerged as one of the best in Ligue 1 in his position.",
      "‘In figures published in April by Datascout, he came out on top among 49 defensive midfielders for sprinting speed, fourth for the number of accelerations and sixth for high-intensity distance covered.’",

      "The outlet wrote on X: ‘EXCL. Manchester United is now looking for a new GK. 25 yo OGC Nice GK Marcin Bułka among interests. Marcin Bulka is open to a move this summer as he has already asked to leave Nice.’",
      "It comes as no surprise that United are looking to Nice in order to improve their squad given the Ligue 1 side are also owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but any moves would have to wait until the last day of the transfer window on September 1 after UEFA put a ban on the multi-club transfers as a result of both teams competing in the Europa League together last season.",
      "A report on Monday claimed United may not be looking to sign a new goalkeeper in any case, or not a new No.1 at least, as Amorim has decided to put his ‘trust’ in Andre Onana.",
      "The Portuguese boss has ‘conveyed to the board his intention to count on him as a key piece in his project’ and ‘does not contemplate any other alternative’.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim still sees Onana as the ‘ideal profile’ to build from the back thanks to his ‘technical conditions and ability to play with his feet’.",

      "Amorim is working closely with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to rebuild an ailing squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "The focus is very much on attacking players in the transfer market, with Matheus Cunha already joining the club after the Red Devils triggered his £62.5m release clause to land him from Wolves.",
      "They’ve had one bid rejected by Bryan Mbeumo by Brentford of £55m plus a further £10m in add-ons, and are considering an improved bid amid competition from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "Having been beaten to the signing of Liam Delap by Chelsea they’re also scouring the market for a new N0.9, though their pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres appears to have ended after the striker told them where to go.",

      "It was claimed back in April that Onana had been ‘sentenced’ to the Old Trafford exit, with Nice’s Marcin Bułka and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez among a whole host of goalkeepers linked with a move to replace the Cameroonian.",
      "But transfer expert Ben Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT last week that the United bosses hadn’t yet decided whether to source a new stopper or retain Onana as first choice.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.’",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes now claims they have made their minds up, or rather Amorim has made the decision for them – Onana will remain United’s No.1 goalkeeper.",

      "Brown said last month: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start.",

      "The Bianconeri’s attacking corps includes Dusan Vlahovic, Arkadiusz Milik, Timothy Weah and Kenan Yildiz but Vlahovic and Yildiz in particular are known to be of interest to other clubs in the summer transfer window.",

      "“Obviously, it is a complex deal. It certainly is from an economic point of view: the Bianconeri, after an initial offer, have relaunched by getting closer to the boy’s wishes.”",
      "Chief among Gyokeres’ reported expectations is a colossal £11m per year in wages, the kind of income that could tempt a young man to abandon hopes of a Premier League move and keep him in hair product for a lifetime.",
      "Gyokeres joined Sporting from Coventry City in 2023 after almost firing the Sky Blues back to the top flight of English football.",
      "His scoring record in Portugal has been nothing short of absurd. Gyokeres has scored 68 goals in 66 league appearances for the Lisbon giants and six times in six starts in the Champions League.",
      "In all competitions, he’s scored 97 goals in 102 Sporting appearances. While it’s certainly possible to question how effectively a prolific scorer can apply his abilities in the Premier League or Serie A, these are numbers that cannot be ignored.",

      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for players in the modern era but this summer has been marked by transfer decisions being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid\nFinishing 19th in the 2019 Ballon d’Or vote – and collecting more career votes than Paul Scholes in the process – planted a seed in the mind of Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Zero points from his next and most recent shortlist appearance in 2022 helped crystallise a decision he would formalise three years later, dragging him kicking and screaming (in fluent Spanish) away from his Anfield home.",
      "In hindsight, publicly and proudly picking a Ballon d’Or win over becoming Liverpool captain, lifting the World Cup with England or claiming a second Champions League was the first sign for the Reds that simply being the sole Scouser in their team was not enough to sate some grandiose life goals.",
      "“I want to be the first full-back to ever do it,” he said of his Ballon d’Or ambition, adding that his desire was to be remembered as “a legend of football, someone who changed the game” with a “legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football”.",
      "Jan Kromkamp has a lot to answer for.",
      "With Michael Owen in 2001 still the only winner of the award as a Liverpool player, and Real Madrid offering a platform to more individual champions than any other club in history, it was not difficult to see where Alexander-Arnold was signalling and manoeuvring with his career crossroads on the horizon.",
      "Conducted in October 2024 at a time Alexander-Arnold was supposedly locked in negotiations with Liverpool over extending a contract due to expire in the summer, it might as well have been an exit interview.",
      "Alexander-Arnold did downplay the Ballon d’Or lure at his Real unveiling, saying he was not sure it “influenced my decision to come here at all” as “it is going to be quite hard to win the Ballon d’Or with the amount of superstars in this team”.",
      "But he also claimed to have been learning Spanish for “a few months”, and said he “grew up watching Real Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row” despite literally appearing in the last of those finals, so his status as a reliable narrator is uncertain.",
      "",
      "Rayan Cherki joining Manchester City\n“I want to win the Ballon d’Or and win the Champions League,” reads and sounds like a bold but feasible set of objectives laid out by Cherki as a new Manchester City signing.",

      "The Frenchman understandably never came close to enacting that plan in a solid but unspectacular Lyon side, but the Manchester City spotlight was a specific driving factor in his £30.5m summer switch.",
      "“When you see Rodri win the Ballon d’Or it is clear with Manchester City it is possible to do so and I am here for this,” he said in his first Etihad interview.",

      "But it remains a holy grail of sorts – and a key motivation behind his decision to resist Saudi Arabia overtures and continue at Liverpool with a new contract.",
      "“It’s not in my hands, but obviously, one day I would like to win the Ballon d’Or for my people,” he said in May. “When you come from a village in Egypt, as a child, it’s difficult to dream of the Ballon d’Or. It was when I came to Liverpool that I started to think that, maybe, one day…”",
      "Salah went on to point out that “several winners in recent years have been in their 30s” so his candidacy remains strong, as “next season promises to be exciting with the defence of our title with Liverpool and the Champions League, the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and the World Cup.”",
      "Jamie Carragher will be wondering why the little dancer listed three major tournaments there alongside a jolly continent-wide gathering, but 2026 does feel like Salah’s best opportunity to round off his long catalogue of achievements.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho deciding his next steps\nVinicius Junior came second. Callum Hudson-Odoi was third. Phil Foden and Rodrygo rounded out the top five. But they all lagged behind Sancho in the running for Goal’s NXGN award, handed to the season’s best player under the age of 19.",
      "It can be an indicator of success for the transition from prodigious excellence to brilliance at a more senior level; the last two winners were Lamine Yamal and Jude Bellingham.",

      "Sancho never envisaged taking that path when he was crowned in 2019, saying: “This is not the end of it. I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or, given the likes of those who have won it previously, like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Modric and Ronaldinho.”",
      "Six years later, compulsive buyers Chelsea have paid £5m to specifically not sign him and the 25-year-old has no part to play in the Manchester United revolution.",

      "“Since Rodri won it, it’s shown that a player who runs the midfield and dictates the tempo and the rhythm of the game can win a Ballon d’Or,” said compatriot Pedri, one of the standard-bearers of the next generation of midfield metronomes.",
      "“It’s always been a dream of mine to lift the Ballon d’Or,” he added in May. “But right now, there’s a month to go, and the focus is on the team – on completing the Treble, which is what really matters and once that month’s over, we’ll see if we can start talking about things like that.”",
      "The conversation sadly ended there, with Pedri powerless to stop Inter in the Champions League semi-finals before defeat to Portugal in the Nations League final. The sight of Vitinha and Joao Neves controlling the games on each of those occasions cannot have helped.",
      "But perhaps the answer is staring Pedri in the face: a British transfer record move to Manchester City to truly emulate Rodri.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly ‘slightly concerned’ about Real Madrid interest in another of their stars after Trent Alexander-Arnold left for the LaLiga giants.",
      "Manchester United could be under threat from the same European giant for two of their players, as they are ‘making an attempt’ to land a second forward.",
      "An actual footballer can learn a foreign language?! If you’re surprised, maybe you’re the thick one…",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",
      "Liverpool will eventually pay a British record transfer fee for Florian Wirtz while Manchester City have paid just £30.5m for Rayan Cherki."

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
