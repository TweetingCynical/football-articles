      "The Glazer family are said to have been less than impressed with Sir Jim Ratcliffe following the Ineos chief's claim that Manchester United were at risk of 'going bust by Christmas' earlier this year.",
      "Ratcliffe, 72, acquired a minority stake in his boyhood club back in December 2023. The terms of his agreement with the Glazers has seen the petrochemicals billionaire assume control of sporting operations at Old Trafford, though the Americans have remained at the club.",
      "Since taking control at United, Ratcliffe has overseen a number of cost-cutting measures in his bid to return the club to profitability, including around 450 redundancies.",
      "Ratcliffe laid the club's financial woes bare in an interview with BBC Sport to reason for such moves, where the Brit revealed the funds he injected had helped to keep United afloat.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put $300m (£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer,\" he explained back in March.",
      "\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\"",
      "A new report from The Athletic has now revealed that particular claim 'did sat easily' with the Glazers. The report also notes that 'ripples of discontent' have been noticed by some within United's hierarchy, with Ratcliffe's desire to hold ExCos in different locations - ones which are 'primarily suited to him' - have made things slightly more inconvenient for the Glazers.",
      "While the Glazers have been the subject of discontent among the supporter base for years, Ratcliffe has also been targeted in recent months in the wake of some of his cost-cutting measures.",
      "United, meanwhile, have continued to struggle on the pitch and are currently languishing in 16th place as their worst ever campaign of the Premier League era mercifully draws to a close.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted to being 'embarrassed' by United's current plight and even suggested that he should be sacked if results do not improve next season ahead of a seismic summer for the club and their hierarchy.",
      "He said: “It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons.”"

      "Protests, marches and demonstrations against the Glazers have raged since then, with the latest planned for United's final game of the season against Aston Villa.",
      "A statement from The 1958 read: \"Our final home game of the season is against Aston Villa. We march, as one fanbase, to make it clear - 20 years on, the fire still burns red, with fury and defiance. We protest, once again, at Villa.",
      "\"May 2005 marked one of the darkest days in the history of Manchester United Football Club. The Glazer family became majority shareholders, triggering a compulsory takeover that was completed on 29th June 2005.",
      "\"That moment signalled the beginning of the end for the soul and community of our once-great club — sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, a staunch supporter of the Glazers then and now, masked the damage with unprecedented success on the pitch.",
      "\"Since his retirement, the rot beneath has been laid bare for all to see — the true cost of 20 years of financial exploitation and mismanagement.",
      "\"The club is drowning in over a billion pounds of debt. Our fanbase is fractured and divided, our stadium neglected - down to Glazer greed and betrayal.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions have been siphoned off to service that debt — not by the Glazers, but by our club. All while the Glazers continue to pocket dividends, year after year, regardless of failure on the pitch. Old Trafford, once the Theatre of Dreams, is crumbling from decades of neglect. They’ve taken everything.",
      "\"Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers’ reign.",
      "Lifelong, loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love — priced out and pushed aside. Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community. We want the Glazers out of our club. They were never welcome. They are not welcome now. They will never be welcome.\""

Spurs plan to give out around 700 free tickets to the final in Bilbao - one for each of the club's full-time employees - in contrast to their opponents at San Mames.",
      "The two struggling Premier League teams have a chance to salvage something from their season in the Basque Country. United and Spurs sit 16th and 17th respectively in the table, but progressed to the Europa League final after decisive semi-final wins against Athletic Club and Bodo/Glimt respectively.",
      "Both teams will have an allocation of 15,000 tickets for the final, with the winners earning a spot in next season's Champions League. According to The Mail, Spurs have offered a free ticket to each staff member, though the offer is not understood to include travel or accommodation.",
      "United, in contrast, won't be doling out free tickets to staff. The news comes against a backdrop of significant cost-cutting under billionaire part-owner Ratcliffe, with the workforce trimmed substantially since his arrival partway through the 2023-24 season.",
      "A small number of United's staff members will have the chance to win tickets via a ballot, while those unable to attend will be able to watch a screening of the game. They will reportedly be given two free drinks at the screening, while any plus-one they bring will have to pay for their own refreshments.",
      "Spurs will be playing in just their second European final of the 21st century and their second against English opposition. The first came in 2019, when they were beaten 2-0 by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final.",

      "Ruben Amorim has felt for a while that it might not be in Manchester United's best interests to play Champions League football next season. If United beat Tottenham in next week's Europa League final, they will go straight into European football's elite club competition next season.",
      "That is despite suffering 17 defeats in their worst season of the Premier League era, with United currently down in 16th, one place above Spurs. That one of those two sides will be in the Champions League next season is at odds with a competition supposedly showcasing the best sides in Europe, with Amorim unsure if playing in it would benefit United.",
      "He had confided as much to his inner circle before going public with his feelings in the aftermath of Sunday's lamentable 2-0 defeat at home to West Ham. “I don’t know what is best,” said Amorim. “If it’s playing in the Champions League or not.”",
      "Amorim's forthright nature has been refreshing, but his admission United may be better off without the Champions League and he may not be the man to lead them long-term, was ill-advised. His comments will certainly have not gone down well with the club's hierarchy, in particular co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Winning the Europa League – and with it a ticket to the Champions League – is worth up to £100million, money United cannot afford to lose out on, given the perilous nature of the club's finances, which has led to 450 redundancies and savage cutbacks.",
      "The prospect of losing to Spurs and enduring a season without European football for only the second time in 35 years is therefore unthinkable for Ratcliffe and those in charge at United.",
      "But for Amorim it may prove be the best scenario, giving him more time to work with his squad, without the added burden of eight Champions League games that United's players are clearly not ready or equipped for.",
      "That Amorim is effectively saying it might be better to lose to Spurs is a damning indictment of where United find themselves – a club that once ruled at home and abroad, but is now considered better off not embarrassing itself on Europe's biggest stage and instead embarking on a period of self-reflection, away from prying eyes.",
      "The problem for Amorim and his players is that there is no hiding place at arguably the world's biggest club, where the focus and scrutiny is unparalleled, whether the team is racking up trophies or grubbing around near the bottom of the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's request to see out the rest of this season at Sporting Lisbon, before taking over at United, has been vindicated by the disastrous way the campaign has gone. Amorim felt it was best to start afresh at United this summer, with a full pre-season behind him.",
      "But Ratcliffe and his cronies pressured him into leaving mid-season and are now suffering the consequences of rushing Amorim into leaving against his instincts, with United now worse off than when they sacked Erik ten Hag last October.",
      "When Ten Hag went, United were seven points off the top four. Now, after just six wins from 25 league games under Amorim, they are 26 points off the top four, two places above the relegation zone.",
      "United are at their lowest ebb since they were relegated half a century ago, led by a manager who has questioned his decision to take the job, ahead of a final he is not sure is worth winning. The fallen giants have truly hit rock bottom and it is hard to see a way back to the glory days of the past any time soon. Just ask Amorim."

      "Former Manchester United starlet Daniel Nardiello was one of the first casualties of the Glazer family's takeover, being released by the club before earning just £90-a-week at Blackpool.",
      "This Monday marks 20 years since Malcolm Glazer launched his formal bid to take over the Red Devils. He acquired John Magnier and J.P. McManus' 28.7 per cent stake, boosting his own share to around 57 per cent. By the end of that month, he had a whopping 76 per cent ownership of the club.",
      "And by June, the American tycoon had secured 98 per cent of shares and control of United, causing outrage among fans for having funded his purchase with loans secured against the club's assets.",
      "Since then, the Glazers have been at the helm and faced repeated backlash for the decaying of the club's infrastructure as well as the team's decline on the pitch. In February 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was given complete control of football operations by the family after buying a minority stake in the club.",
      "One of the first moves made by the Glazers in June 2005 was to let go of a group of players. The released players included Coventry-born forward Nardiello, Northern Irish goalkeeper Roy Carroll, Spanish shot-stopper Ricardo, Republic of Ireland defender Paul Tierney and Gambian striker Arthur Gomez.",
      "Nardiello, who came through the academy ranks at Wolves, joined United in 1999 and quickly rose through the Under-17 and Under-19 teams to make his debut in 2000/2001 in the League Cup against Arsenal.",
      "The following season saw him mainly playing in the reserves, where he netted 12 goals before being loaned out to Swansea City for a month in October 2003.",
      "The Welsh international spent the latter half of the 2003/04 season on loan at Barnsley, scoring seven goals in 16 matches. He returned to Oakwell for the 2004/05 season on loan, adding another seven goals to his tally in 30 games.",
      "Deemed surplus to requirements by Sir Alex Ferguson and the new club hierarchy, he was released on June 30, 2005, ahead of the 2005/06 season, without playing a minute of Premier League football and having made just four appearances in all competitions.",
      "After his release, Nardiello signed a two-year contract with Barnsley in July 2005, scoring two crucial goals in their League One play-off matches that season. After two years, he rejected a new contract offer to sign for Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, before rejoining Barnsley on loan in January 2008.",
      "He returned to QPR at the end of the 2007/08 season, after which he inked a two-year deal with another Championship side, Blackpool. His full debut for the Seasiders only came in January 2009 following an injury-plagued stint at the club.",
      "And it was there that he agreed to a contract clause, which meant he, along with the other Blackpool players, was only paid £90-a-week during the summer break. When asked about his bizarre wages on the Undr The Cosh podcast, Nardiello explained: \"I went to Blackpool, I was on decent wages but every summer for six weeks I was being paid £90 a week.",
      "\"It was just really weird. There were lads there playing in the Championship on £600-a-week and they had to save their pennies for the summer. It was like what the hell is going on. It was such a poorly run club.\"",
      "When quizzed on what the benefit of that was for the club, the 42-year-old replied: \"They just saved on everything that club. It wasn't a Championship-run club.",
      "\"You had to take your kit home every day and wash your kits, there was no heating in the training ground and the food they served was like slop, when players were turning up in Porsches and lovely cars on Championship wages.\"",
      "He continued: \"It was such a strange club to be a part of,\" before being asked if he knew about the bizarre rule before signing. Nardiello replied: \"I knew about the £90 quid before I signed because they told me.",
      "\"I think everyone did [struggle with it]. Because you go from whatever you're used to getting on a monthly basis and then one month you're getting next to nothing and you've still got your mortgage to pay and your bills to pay.\"",
      "During his two-year spell at Blackpool, he was loaned out to Hartlepool United, Bury and Oldham before making a permanent move to Exeter City in 2010. Nardiello only played nine games for Blackpool, scoring one goal.",
      "He later had stints at Rotherham United, Bury, Plymouth Argyle and Bangor City before retiring in October 2017, after being let go by the Welsh Premier League team."

That would ultimately see United's board write to the remaining shareholders to reveal their intention to sell and advise the recipients to do the same.",

      "Andy Walsh was part of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA), and among a group of fans working on a rival bid for the club via Shareholders United and the Japanese bank Nomura. Wash had developed a relationship with Ferguson and made a late plea in his desire to stop the Glazers.",
      "\"My call to Alex Ferguson was to ask him to consider resigning,” Walsh told The Athletic. \"He genuinely believed the supporters should be heard in the takeover.\"",

      "“We felt any loss of support from senior management executives — Ferguson and Gill — would have dealt a fatal blow.”",
      "Walsh's plan would have hoped Ferguson's resignation would see the deal collapse. Ferguson would then return to his position off the back of the fan-led offering, but it was not a risk the Scotsman was willing to take.",

      "Speaking on ViaPlay, he said: “It’s all on Arteta, all. What I’m saying is, he was employed as head coach. He inherited the team and that team is the only team that he has won a trophy with.",
      "“Then it’s his own team and then in the process, he’s now changed the job description so he’s now the manager. Everything is on him. It’s not recruitment, it’s not the board.",
      "“Whenever they [fans] get the opportunity today, watch him in the technical area. Arteta is a control freak, he wants his players to play the ball that he wants. He’s directing everything.",
      "“You look across to Arne Slot who’s so calm. He’s instructed his players in training, instructed the players in the team talk. Arteta is still playing the game for the players and that would confuse the hell out of me as a football player that you had a coach that wants to direct me for everything I do. It would confuse me and make me a worse player.”",
      "Schmeichel is not the only one who has commented on Arteta’s position. Ex-Liverpool star Jamie Carragher has noticed a change in demeanour from the Arsenal boss, believing he is now potentially looking for excuses behind the club’s failure to win a trophy.",
      "\"He was really strong on how many players they've had sent off this season. He's putting his hands up saying six. I think he's convinced inside that they have been victims in some ways, with the sendings off and injuries they have had.",
      "\"I think deep down he thinks they could have won the league without this and that. There's no doubt they would be a lot closer but the sendings-off are down to you. They weren't all sendings-off, but that can happen in a season.",
      "\"The injuries have hit them this season but they also played for them last season. What they have done in terms of competing Man City in the last two seasons is fantastic but a lot of that was down to having the same eight or nine players week in, week out, and him never rotating.\""

      "\"We've got to be careful about Sunday's game, but next Friday it's a bit different. I think we've just got to make decisions we think [are right]. Ultimately we want to be in a great condition come the final, so we'll use that.\"",
      "The final will mark Postecoglou's 100th game in charge of Spurs, with the Australian relishing the occasion. He added: \"I think it is quite a significant achievement, you know, we've got ourselves to a European final.",
      "\"It hasn't been without its challenges for sure, it hasn't been a smooth run. It's well chronicled but irrespective of all that just to reach a final of a major tournament, it's hugely satisfying, but also really proud of the way this group has found a way.",
      "\"It'd be a nice little bow there for that 100 and it's been a really full 100. It's fair to say I've experienced just about every emotion in it and hopefully the one main emotion we're all after will be the joy at the end of it.\""

      "Mason Greenwood could secure the Premier League return he craves in the next 12 months with two top-flight clubs now supposedly ready to pursue a deal for the former Manchester United forward.",
      "Greenwood, 23, moved to France last summer in a deal worth £26million after being informed he had no future at Old Trafford. He has delivered in a Marseille shirt, too, accumulating 20 goals and five assists across 35 games for Roberto De Zerbi's side.",
      "Despite Greenwood's fine maiden campaign in Ligue 1, it was recently claimed that he is 'yearning' for a return to England - and it now seems as though he could be offered the chance to move back across the channel sooner rather than later.",
      "As revealed by The Telegraph, there are two Premier League clubs who are now 'weighing up' the possibility of offering Greenwood a route back to England, with figures close to Marseille accepting a transfer within the next two windows is 'possible'.",
      "However, there is said to be a difference of opinion among those close to Greenwood over whether or not he is ready to return to the Premier League.",
      "The Sun previously claimed that playing abroad has helped Greenwood and his partner, Harriet Robson, 'rebuild their lives' after charges of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour against the striker were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "The 'novelty' of playing overseas has worn off, though, with Greenwood keen on a return to his native north-west. Manchester United would stand to profit should their former academy star making another move due to a sell-on clause which was inserted in the deal that took him to France last year.",
      "While Greenwood has been amongst the goals for Marseille, who are currently second in the Ligue 1 table, he has also encountered setbacks. His work ethic has been questioned by both De Zerbi and supporters, with the club's Ultras unfurling a banner urging Greenwood to \"get a move on\".",
      "De Zerbi did take the time to laud the forward's ability last month, saying: \"Greenwood is a natural talent. All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I'm here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that's my job.",

There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I'm trying to help him progress."

Just 72 hours after beating Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate to reach the Europa League final, Amorim and his players were cast back in their familiar role this season as the Premier League's laughing stock.",
      "Since taking over in November, Amorim has overseen 25 Premier League games, losing 13 and winning just six, to leave United languishing down in 16th place. This defeat was their 17th in the league this season, the most since they were relegated in 1974, with United having lost more league games at home this season than away – nine at Old Trafford compared to eight on the road.",
      "No wonder there were great swathes of empty red seats all around the stadium, long before the final whistle. It is a truly abysmal record, one that would surely have got Amorim the sack at the end of the season, were it not for an all or nothing shot at redemption in the shape of the Europa League final.",
      "Just as winning the FA Cup last season saved Erik ten Hag, albeit only for a few months, lifting the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on May 21 is likely to prolong Amorim's tenure.",
      "But defeat to Tottenham in the San Mames Stadium, on the back of such a lamentable domestic campaign, will see legitimate questions asked about Amorim's future. Even though Amorim made six changes to the side that overcame Bilbao, there was enough talent and experience within his starting line-up to produce a more competitive performance than the limp offering that has become an all-too familiar story for United this season.",
      "In contrast, West Ham were ebullient from start to finish and worthy winners, taking the lead in the 26th minute, with former United full-back Aaaron Wan-Bissaka playing Mohammed Kudus in behind the home defence. Kudus feigned to cross, fooling Amad and allowing him time and space to drill a delivery into the six-yard box, where Tomas Soucek was waiting to turn the ball over the line.",
      "It was no more than the visitors deserved, after a confident and enterprising start to the game, in contrast to the hosts, who lacked fluency in their build-up play and had no cutting edge up front. Rasmus Hojlund, with just four Premier League goals all season, continued to toil up front, his ineffective display underlining the need for United to sign a prolific and proven scorer this summer, to lead their insipid attack.",
      "Hojlund found himself through on goal just after the half-hour mark, courtesy of a delivery from Manuel Ugarte, but the £72million forward produced a slapstick attempt at controlling the ball, which flew off his right boot and behind for a goal-kick.",
      "James Ward-Prowse was presented with a chance to double West Ham's lead two minutes after the restart, but sent his low shot straight at United keeper Altay Bayindir. But Graham Potter's side made it 2-0 in the 57th minute, Ugarte weak in possession and giving up the ball cheaply under pressure from Wan-Bissaka, enabling Kudus to surge towards the United goal.",
      "Kudus saw his shot blocked, the ball spun to Wan-Bissaka, who picked out Jarrod Bowen at the far post, the West Ham skipper presented with the simplest of finishes from close-range. Hojlund looked certain to score with 11 minutes left, but Alphonse Areola pulled off a fine save at point-blank range to deny him, moments after sub Harry Haguire had flashed a header wide."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim was left with his head in his hands after being told about the extent of Leny Yoro's injury. The French defender was forced off during their defeat to West Ham.",
      "United were beaten yet again at Old Trafford, but their woes were deepened by the injury to Yoro, which could rule him out of the Europa League final in 10 days time. The 19-year-old received treatment for an injury early in the second half but was unable to continue, with Harry Maguire having to come on.",
      "Amorim was getting the debrief from a United medic in the aftermath of Yoro's withdrawal and was evidently gutted by the news he received.",
      "Yoro will undergo scans to determine the extent of his injury, but he will need a quick recovery if he is to feature in the European final in Bilbao a week on Wednesday - which has huge Champions League implications.",
      "United have been playing weakened teams since beating Athletic Bilbao in the first-leg of their semi-final, but against the Hammers chose to play a number of their leading lights - Luke Shaw, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Amad among them.",
      "Amorim's decision to play some of his regulars didn't halt their poor Premier League form as United lost for a fifth time in seven games. It was also in stark contrast to the much changed line-up he fielded during the loss at Brentford last weekend.",
      "Before that game he said: \"Maybe some kids will have to play against Brentford. We have some problems in our squad. Some players are in the limit. We will try to manage everything and the best way is to prepare for all these things. We'll see what we can do at the weekend.\"",
      "Despite United having nothing to play for domestically Amorim's decision to name a team with the majority of his regulars looks to have backfired. Even with several of their big guns playing the Red Devils' poor record at Old Trafford continued against West Ham.",
      "It was a loss to the Hammers earlier this season that resulted in Erik ten Hag's sacking. Graham Potter's side have now completed the double over the Manchester outfit with Tomas Soucek scoring in the first-half before Jarrod Bowen made the game safe."

      "Ruben Amorim has cut ties with two of the three Manchester United stars who 'let Erik Ten Hag down' when the Red Devils were beaten by West Ham in 2024. Ten Hag was finally sacked as head coach of the Red Devils in late October following a woeful start to the season.",
      "Less than 24 hours before his exit, the Dutchman's United had suffered a 2-1 defeat by West Ham, courtesy of a controversial last-gasp penalty from Jarrod Bowen, after winning only four of their 14 games to start the campaign.",
      "United faced the Hammers for the first time since that fateful fixture this Sunday at Old Trafford. Both sides are enduring torrid seasons as they sit way down in the bottom half of the table. Amorim's men lost 2-0 in yet another afternoon to forget.",
      "And it was extremely telling that, just over six months after Ten Hag's sacking, two of the three players he reportedly took issue with were not only not involved against West Ham, but no longer at the club.",
      "It's fair to say that the majority of the Dutchman's squad was sub-par throughout his tenure. But the Daily Star reported at the time that the head coach was particularly frustrated by Casemiro, Antony and Marcus Rashford, who he believed were partially responsible for his exit.",
      "Rashford only scored once in the league this season under Ten Hag and has spent the past year making headlines for the wrong reasons.",
      "The misfiring striker's long-term dip in form left his manager without a goal-scorer, having managed to net 17 (30 in all competitions) during Ten Hag's debut season.",
      "Meanwhile, Casemiro also suffered a dip in form after an impressive first season at Old Trafford. He suddenly appeared to lack the fitness required at the top level and made several errors leading to goals, which didn't help the Dutchman's cause.",
      "Antony, too, was specifically signed by Ten Hag for a whopping £86million in the hope that he'd recreate the performances he displayed under the manager at Ajax. He came nowhere near justifying that price tag in the end and stained Ten Hag's transfer record.",
      "Amorim, who took the helm in November, appears to share his predecessor's feelings. He used Antony sparingly and froze Rashford out of his squad in late 2024, before sending them out on loan in January to Real Betis and Aston Villa, respectively.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, has also been used sparingly by the Portuguese in the league. He has been left on the bench as an unused substitute 13 times since his arrival.",
      "While Antony and Rashford appear to have played their last games as United players, the Brazilian midfielder at least has the opportunity to lift some silverware when the Red Devils take on Tottenham in the Europa League final on May 21."

      "West Ham ensured Manchester United's Premier League woes continued as the Red Devils matched their longest run without a win in the competition. They have failed to earn three points in their last seven matches for the first time since 1992.",
      "The Irons' 2-0 victory saw them end a 16-game winless run at Old Trafford and secure a record of winning four of their last five meetings against the 13-time Premier League champions. United showed some positive play in the early stages but it was the visitors who were able to find a way through.",
      "Brilliant build-up play saw Aaron Wan-Bissaka play in Mohammed Kudus, who smartly sent Amad to the floor before firing the ball across the box. Tomas Soucek was on hand to nudge the ball between Harry Amass' legs and into the net from close range.",
      "United showed all of the quality their league position suggests in the second period as Manuel Ugarte quickly fell to the floor under pressure in his own half to spark another attack for the Irons. Wan-Bissaka was involved again to provide a perfect ball across the six-yard box for Jarrod Bowen to double his side's lead.",
      "Mason Mount, Amad, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo all came off the bench and sparked a change in United's second leg Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao. They were tasked with impressing from the start as Ruben Amorim's stars now all vie for a place to play in the European final.",
      "A curling cross-field ball from Mount to Amad hinted at what could be unleashed from the troop at their best, and the latter often proved to be full of pace and tempo to provide a threat. But one again, as with most United stars this season, there were difficult moments.",
      "Mainoo struggled in an advanced position that had seen Bruno Fernandes dropped deeper, and Luke Shaw's positioning was far from perfect in a back three. There will be tough decisions to make ahead of the Europa League final and Amad probably has the best chance to keep his place for now.",
      "While some players will be performing with an eye on facing Spurs in Bilbao, otherwise will be hoping to prove to Amorim that they are worthy of a squad spot next year and others, perhaps their next club.",
      "Altay Bayindir started his second Premier League game in succession for the Red Devils and likely faces the prospect of playing to show his ability to a new team, should he want to find first time football. The Turkish ace earned his spot in net with Andre Onana being rested and despite the No.1's failures this season, Bayindir has failed to offer an argument he should take his position.",
      "Sunday saw an unconvincing outing for the goalkeeper who was unable to provide an authorative presence and showed some questionable communication. Tested early in the second period by James Ward-Prowse, Bayindir stood up to the task but he may be required to do more to have teams knocking at the door and to turn slow down United's search for a new shotstopper.",
      "In the opposite net, Alphonse Areola proved to be a wall as United knocked on the door in the second half and pulled off an impressive 79th-minute save to deny Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Leny Yoro looked downbeat as he was guided off the pitch with an injury. Never a good sign with a final to come in 10 days time. Ruben Amorim's team selections have been hampered by injury in recent months, and even for this game Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Toby Collyer were all watching on from the directors' box.",
      "Amorim immediately replaced Luke Shaw alongside Yoro, seeming to want to protect the player as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof came into play. There could certainly be a nervous week for United as they prepare for their lone chance at success this season.",
      "Only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton had earned fewer points than the Irons since Graham Potter's first match in charge of the club. They had been winless in eight games heading to Old Trafford where winning is not something the Londoners experience often.",
      "Potter managed to see United's central weakness and offered Mohammed Kudus plenty of freedom to cause the home side issues throughout the game. Given their position in the league, few teams offer better chance to pick up three points than United and Potter's side ultimately took advantage.",
      "Earning three points at the Theatre of Dreams will offer an important boost to West Ham's boss, and its reputation will offer some credibility even with United's deficiencies. It was critical for Potter to find that heading into next season.",
      "From a United perspective, given another defeat, you would hope not. Heading into the afternoon, the highest the club could finish was 12th and a positive result for the Hammers would see them leapfrog their hosts.",
      "\"We can't save anything from the Premier League,\" Amorim said ahead of the game. \"But we do have to acknowledge we are - and we need to win games.\"",
      "It was not on the agenda at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Red Devils had big chances but perhaps offered their opponents better ones.",
      "The club are in a battle for 17th and avoiding that will likely take a backseat to any European aspirations. Wins will be wanted, but that does not feel in United's control in the division."

The Europa League finalists will meet in Bilbao on May 21, with Leny Yoro and Dejan Kulusevski both facing a race against time to be fit for the showpiece.",
      "United centre-back Yoro missed the start of the season through injury and suffered a fresh setback at home to West Ham. The Frenchman received treatment for an injury early in the second half but was unable to continue, with Harry Maguire taking his place.",
      "Earlier in the day, Spurs midfielder Kulusevski managed just 20 minutes in the London derby against Crystal Palace. Young forward Mikey Moore replaced the Swede, who only returned in April after a foot injury.",
      "United and Spurs both trailed at half-time as they looked to follow their Europa League semi-final wins with a result in the league. Ruben Amorim's Red Devils completed a 7-1 aggregate victory over Athletic Bilbao on Thursday, with Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham 5-1 aggregate victors over Bodo/Glimt, but both found things tougher on their return to domestic action.",
      "Tomas Soucek's close-range finish gave West Ham the lead at Old Trafford, with Jarrod Bowen adding a second just before the hour. Over at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, two Ebere Eze goals either side of the half-time whistle put Palace in control.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim had spoken in the lead-up to the game about balancing fitness and rhythm. Bruno Fernandes had been rested for the recent defeat at Brentford, but was back in the starting XI against West Ham.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League,\" Amorim said. \"Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\"",
      "Spurs were already without James Maddison, who has been ruled out of the final already. The former Leicester star picked up a knee injury in the first-leg victory at home to Bodo/Glimt and will not recover in time.",
      "\"Gutted. Just absolutely gutted,\" Maddison said on social media, \"We’ve had our sights on that European final in Bilbao from day one of this campaign. So to accept not being able to take part out on that pitch with the boys is really tough to take.",

      "Manchester United matchgoers unfurled a foreboding banner bearing the faces of Robson, Cantona and Keane that read ‘Standards’ a few seasons ago. They may start to reassess their own.",
      "One of United’s worst ever teams is still applauded. They routinely embark on half-laps of honour in defeat, certain they will not be barracked. It is a far cry from three years ago and chants of ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ and ‘F**k off Pogba’ during an actual win against Norwich City. The away-dayers re-aired the former at Brighton and Brentford that year.",
      "Wolves and West Ham United have done the double over United in successive months at Old Trafford and there was barely a murmur of discontent in the stands. Apathy is rife.",
      "One is not advocating booing or abuse. A new benchmark was set at Selhurst Park last season. That 4-0 drubbing was the seasonal nadir yet the support from the away end at full-time was remarkably, well, supportive. A friend in the Arthur Wait Stand described it as “poignant”.",
      "United supporters will not turn as long as there is glory on the horizon. That Europa League trophy they can see is not a mirage.",
      "Woe betide the players if they return from Bilbao without some extra hand luggage. The only thing more humiliating than finishing 17th and losing a final to Tottenham is relegation.",
      "The atmosphere on the final day against Aston Villa at Old Trafford will either be optimistic or antagonistic. There was more chanting against the Glazers and those now-permanent banners in front of the directors’ box were brandished again on Sunday.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not been at the stadium since those choreographed protests against his callous treatment of loyal paying supporters began against Wolves on Easter Sunday. A startled security official strode to the front of the directors’ box during the impromptu protest in the first half against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Antipathy towards the owners and the hierarchy is simmering and confirmation of a worst domestic season in 51 years might halt the happy-clappy reactions. United have lost nine times at Old Trafford - as many as when the team was relegated in 1930-31. A tenth against Villa would be unprecedented in a single season.",
      "The supporters' silence spoke volumes on Sunday. There were no boos at half-time or full-time. That is commendable loyalty on a weekend that thousands of histrionic Scousers booed Trent Alexander-Arnold for having the temerity to walk alone.",
      "“It is hard to say something about our fans and everybody,” Ruben Amorim admitted. “There is no explanation, no matter the context. And I‘m talking here, I’m the biggest responsible for that. We need to change a lot of things during the summer.”",
      "Amorim has never been angrier at a post-match press conference. He could be seen gnawing at his knuckles seven minutes after West Ham went 1-0 up.",
      "Those of us present in the press room sensed he would cut loose. It was after a non-televised Sunday afternoon home defeat to Brighton in January that Amorim billed his United as “maybe the worst team in the history of the club”.",
      "The recent four-goal defeats to Newcastle United and Brentford could be dismissed; league fixtures sandwiched between European ties. West Ham was not.",
      "West Ham had not won a match since February 28. They were, at kick-off, the worst team in the top flight bar the three sinking ships plunging into the Championship. Their once placid manager had been so tempestuous in recent press conferences he appeared to be bordering on the brink.",
      "And still Graham Potter was able to motivate West Ham to win at Old Trafford. Amorim was incapable of motivating United’s players to win a first Premier League fixture in seven.",
      "He effectively acknowledged some players pick and choose when to perform. “It’s hard to explain that and that feeling,” he admitted.",
      "“For me, the biggest concern is that feeling it’s okay, we cannot change our position so much so it’s okay. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.”",
      "A colleague singled out Manuel Ugarte. Amorim was reluctant to throw players under the bus. If he was of that persuasion, he would still be in the press room.",
      "Ugarte can cope in the Europa League but barely copes in the Premier League. Rasmus Hojlund curates captions on Instagram more carefully than he strikes the ball. Luke Shaw cannot complete 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo does not know whether he is coming or going. Altay Bayindir wears the number one but is the third-best goalie.",
      "The majority of United’s league losses have been greeted with a shrug of the shoulders. Confirmation of a first bottom-half finish in 35 years against Brentford was not back-page news. Amorim ensured he was the splash on Monday’s editions.",
      "'I'LL HAVE TO GO', warns The Sun. The Mirror went with 'AMBARRASSED'. It was 'SHAMEFUL' on the Express. The Times opted for, 'Amorim: I'll quit if we don't fix this'. He won't quit. He will be sacked.",
      "United’s team against West Ham was stronger than expected. Harry Amass was the sole raw pick. Some starters were signed for £58million, £50m, £60m, £67m, £37m and £72m. United fired blanks for a 14th game this season.",
      "Records continue to tumble with any home United reverse: West Ham won their first league game at Old Trafford since May 2007. Six clubs have done the domestic double over United this season. They have not lost this many league games since they were last relegated.",
      "That is how bad this team is and the players still put their hands together and confidently approached the north-east quadrant at full-time. Old Trafford was half-empty at best and actions speak louder than words.",
      "Amorim pondered whether not winning the Europa League would be a blessing in disguise. United's FA Cup final victory proved to be detrimental in the long run as impressionable and fickle fans forced the decision-makers into a ridiculous U-turn on Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim suggested at his first Carrington press conference back in November that it would be fair to judge him after two years. Make that one year. United’s league position is borderline unforgivable. If they are in an identical position this time next year then there will be a different manager in the dugout.",
      "This has been the worst of the Premier League seasons since its inception in 1992, devoid of a title race and jeopardy at the foot of the table. United have won ten out of 36 games and half of them were against the relegated trio. Fulham (twice), Brentford, Everton and Manchester City ought to feel rueful.",
      "Lose in Bilbao and United should not expect to encounter the open arms of forgiving fans in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong on their post-season tour, either. Harry Maguire was booed in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin during pre-season. Ashley Young copped similar flak in Singapore in 2019.",
      "The memory of United fans serenading Anthony Martial after the final home game of last season was a minor but watershed moment. Martial had put his feet up for five months, failed to support Hojlund and ran down his contract yet got a hero's send-off.",
      "Conveniently, Martial returned to team training for the FA Cup final. Ten Hag coldly omitted him from the squad and Martial could not even be bothered to travel to Wembley.",
      "Those were standards."

      "So what changes can Amorim make? \"I don't know and I don't want to talk about players, I'm talking about myself, I'm talking about the culture in the club and the culture in the team,\" he said.",
      "\"I have that feeling and we need to change that. We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave. We will not have a next season like this if we start like this. If the feeling is still here we should give space to different persons.\"",
      "Amorim said his priority is preparing for Chelsea, however, it has been 'Bilbao or bust' for a few months and the Europa League final will be the game that has a bearing on his future.",
      "Most believe Amorim should be safe regardless of the outcome of the Europa League and backed in the summer window, but the 2025/2026 Premier League season already looks treacherous.",
      "Winning the Europa League at the Estadio de San Mames would salvage the current campaign, although it would not prevent Amorim from immense pressure should United start next season slowly.",
      "That pressure would become something else entirely if Tottenham win the final in Bilbao.",
      "Whichever way the final goes on May 21, Amorim will start the new Premier League campaign knowing he needs to hit the ground running in the league, which will always be the focus.",
      "Ten Hag was in a similar position at the start of the season after winning the FA Cup at Wembley. Then the same problems existed and Ten Hag was finally axed shortly after the October international break.",
      "The October break can be ominous for struggling managers because it's an opportunity to make a change, and there's enough evidence available by then to suggest a change is necessary.",
      "Amorim has aged with the pressure of managing United, but it will increase tenfold next season and he almost certainly will not be in charge if United are in the bottom half of the table by October.",
      "That is the worst-case scenario. Amorim could obviously make an excellent start to the 2025/2026 campaign after signing players who can competently fulfil important roles in his system.",
      "But there hasn't been much on the pitch to indicate that is highly likely to happen."

      "Manchester United supporter group The 1958 have announced a fresh protest against the Glazers' ownership before the final game of the Premier League season against Aston Villa.",
      "The 1958 have organised several peaceful protests against the Glazer family over the last few years and have been at the forefront of protests again throughout an awful 2024/2025 season.",
      "United fans were recently encouraged by The 1958 to join a sit-in protest after the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on April 6. And the supporters group have now announced a fresh protest, which will take place before United play Aston Villa at home on the final day of the season.",
      "The 1958 have reiterated they want the Glazers \"out\" because \"they were never welcome\", and fans have been asked to join the protest against the American family on May 25.",
      "The press release announcing the protest from The 1958 said: \"May 2005 marked one of the darkest days in the history of Manchester United Football Club. The Glazer family became majority shareholders, triggering a compulsory takeover that was completed on 29th June 2005.",
      "\"That moment signalled the beginning of the end for the soul and community of our once-great club — sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson, a staunch supporter of the Glazers then and now, masked the damage with unprecedented success on the pitch. Since his retirement, the rot beneath has been laid bare for all to see — the true cost of 20 years of financial exploitation and mismanagement.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions have been siphoned off to service that debt — not by the Glazers, but by our club. All while the Glazers continue to pocket dividends, year after year, regardless of failure on the pitch.",
      "\"Old Trafford, once the Theatre of Dreams, is crumbling from decades of neglect. They’ve taken everything.",
      "\"Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers’ reign. Lifelong, loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love — priced out and pushed aside. Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community.",
      "\"Make no mistake — this is the legacy of the Glazer family: greed, decay, and betrayal. Our final home game of the season is against Aston Villa. We march. As one fanbase. To make it clear: 20 years on, the fire still burns Red — with fury and defiance.",
      "\"We want the Glazers out of our club. They were never welcome. They are not welcome now. They will never be welcome. We protest once again at Villa, more details to follow.\"",
      "United have protested against the American family since their controversial leveraged buyout in 2005, and the pressure has mounted in the last decade amid declining standards at the club.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke to The Times and said he would walk away from United if the protests were sustained against him. \"[Fan protests] can be unpleasant. And I’ve probably failed on the having fun front. I mean, I can put up with it for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don’t mind being unpopular because I get that nobody likes seeing Manchester United down where they are, and nobody likes the decisions we’re having to make at the moment.",
      "\"Eventually, if it reached the extent that the Glazer family have been abused, then I’d have to say, look, enough’s enough guys, let somebody else do this.",
      "\"They can’t really come to a match, the Glazers. They’ve retreated into the shadows a bit now, so I’m getting all the bloody stick. We bought in and I haven’t seen them since.",
      "\"At the moment, I don’t have security, I don’t have to walk around like that. But it would defeat the object, wouldn’t it? You couldn’t tolerate it at that level, it just wouldn’t be fun.\""

      "Manchester United lost 2-0 to West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim made six changes to his starting team, but he still named a strong side to take on West Ham, with the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Amad named in the starting XI.",
      "Amorim insisted it was important for his side to try and build momentum before the game, but United suffered yet another defeat in the Premier League. Goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen gave West Ham a comfortable victory.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed from United's latest Premier League defeat:",
      "Yoro's injury didn't look good",
      "Leny Yoro delivered one of his finest performances for United against Athletic Bilbao. His driving runs out from the back were superb, but his position was slightly tweaked on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Although Yoro has looked best when playing on the left side of the back-three, where he started last Thursday night, he started in the centre of the defence to accommodate Luke Shaw.",
      "Amorim went surprisingly strong with his team selection, which had the potential to backfire, and that happened when Yoro appeared to pick up a foot injury at the start of the second half.",
      "Yoro was replaced by Harry Maguire and his body language didn't look good as he returned to the dressing room. His demeanour seemed to suggest he knew he would be spending some time on the sidelines, which would be a huge blow ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "The Bilbao chants",
      "United suffered their 17th defeat of the Premier League season against West Ham and the same dross that has been served up at Old Trafford throughout the campaign was dished out again.",
      "West Ham deserved their 2-0 victory and Amad's performance was probably the only positive for United, so it was no surprise to see the Stretford End sing about going to Bilbao with minutes to play.",
      "The Europa League campaign has given fans something to cling onto this season and United must deliver the goods.",
      "Amorim looked nervous",
      "Hojlund went down with a shoulder injury just before half-time. The physio sprinted to give Hojlund medical treatment and the televisions in the press box showed Amorim nervously biting his fingers rather than his fingernails.",
      "It was a risk to start the only available senior striker and Amorim's heart would have been in his mouth as Hojlund received treatment, but he was fine to continue.",
      "United will face Chelsea in the Premier League before the Europa League final on May 21 and it would be logical to rest Hojlund, given he's the only senior centre-forward who is available.",
      "Fernandes had words with Mainoo",
      "It took just 10 minutes for Bruno Fernandes to have words with Kobbie Mainoo, who started in the No.10 role again after playing in the pivot for successive league games against Bournemouth and Brentford.",
      "Mainoo's position has regularly been tweaked by Amorim, which has made it difficult for him to find his groove, and he was shouted at by Fernandes for not making a run between the lines.",
      "Fernandes gave Mainoo an earful and the youngster nodded as his captain explained where he should have been. The advanced midfield role does not come naturally to Mainoo and the jury remains out on whether that should be his permanent role in Amorim's system.",
      "Dalot chats to Brailsford",
      "Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox and Sir Dave Brailsford were present in the directors' box, and the latter exchanged words with Diogo Dalot as the defender took his seat minutes before kick-off.",
      "Brailsford acknowledged Toby Collyer before chatting with Dalot, who could be ruled out for the remainder of the season with a calf injury picked up last month.",
      "Brailsford's involvement at the club has been questionable since Ineos' investment was signed off, and there will be even more scrutiny on his role if United are beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final."

      "It meant United were unable to put long-term plans in place for the summer transfer window having been under the temporary stewardship of Ralf Rangnick since November.",
      "As a result, recruitment planning was thrown into jeopardy, meaning United could not get their wheels in motion until Ten Hag was in position and able to supply the club with a list of targets. A big summer of spending saw the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro and Antony arrive, with the latter arriving for a fee north of £80million from Ajax.",
      "To assist with their negotiations, United appointed Keane, the brother of former Reds youngsters Michael and Will. He was appointed in a temporary consultancy role to offset the departure of the former director of football negotiations Matt Judge.",
      "Almost three years on, he has now opened up on how the 2022 summer transfer window unfolded from his perspective, admitting he practically moved into United's Carrington training ground.",
      "\"There was a couple of challenges,\" Keane told The Overlap Breakdown podcast. \"One of the biggest challenges was everybody was new; I'd just walked through the door and the manager had come through the door in May.",
      "\"I think John [Murtough] had been at the club for a while but he had just become football director. Richard [Arnold] had just become CEO. There was a head of data.",

      "\"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons,\" the boss admitted to reporters watching his Man United side fall to defeat again.",
      "\"I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "\"So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.\"",
      "Amorim's side can of course still qualify for next season's Champions League despite sitting 16th domestically. They must beat Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final later this month.",
      "He came to inherit a team that previously played in a 4-2-3-1 formation, quite different to his preferred 3-4-3 system, so there has had to be extra work done to train players into an alternate way of playing.",
      "And speaking to The Telegraph and The Times in March, Man United part-owner Ratcliffe had stated his pleasure in the work the manager he helped bring to the club during this season is doing.",
      "\"I think he’s done a great job in the circumstances, frankly, with the squad that he’s had available, the fact he came in mid-season,\" he explained.",
      "\"Everybody expects miracles overnight. It’s not the way, not real life in my view. I mean, you saw the performance yesterday (against Arsenal).",
      "\"It was, I thought, a really impressive performance. They could not have worked harder. They couldn’t have been more committed.",
      "\"And if you looked at the names on the bench, there weren’t many you recognised, were there? Half the squad’s missing for Ruben.",
      "\"If you look at the top eight players in terms of salaries in Manchester United, 50 percent of those are not available to Ruben.",
      "\"You’ve got Mason Mount, you’ve got Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford has gone, and Jadon Sancho (on loan at Chelsea).",
      "\"And he’s got a bunch of other injuries as you know, so I think he’s done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Before that time, the new coach had branded his team the worst in Man United's entire history, to which Ratcliffe could only respond: \"I think coaches are emotional and Ruben’s no exception to that.",
      "\"And he’s a young coach. And he’s not perfect. You know, he’s not a guy who … he’s got to be good on the stage, but we want him to be good on the grass. And part of that is life on the stage, isn’t it?\"",
      "Lastly, the minority owner spoke of their relationship and answered if he thinks Amorim will prove to be successful over time.",
      "\"Yeah I do, honestly,” he said. \"I really, really like Ruben. He’s a very thoughtful guy.",
      "\"Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben. I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it’s going wrong, and he tells me to f**k off. I like him.\""

      "Manchester United received a fee of £15million for Wan-Bissaka last summer and his move to the London Stadium allowed United to sign Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich.",
      "West Ham have endured an awful campaign, but they claimed a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon and Wan-Bissaka impressed on his return to Manchester, playing a superb pass to contribute to Tomas Soucek's opener and assisting Jarrod Bowen for the second goal.",
      "Potter was asked about Wan-Bissaka's performance in his post-match press conference and said: \"He's been really impressive. As I've said before, I can't say this categorically because I don't know Aaron's career, but I can't imagine he's played as well [before] as he has for us at this point in his career.",
      "\"He looks like he's enjoying his football. He gives a lot to the team, really pleased with what he's giving to the team offensively and defensively. As I said, it looks like he's enjoying his football.",
      "\"And that's not easy because the results we've had haven't been that enjoyable. But nevertheless, his individual performances have been strong.\"",
      "When asked whether Wan-Bissaka's offensive play had improved, Potter said: \"I don't know the past, but his attributes are his attributes. He has the capacity to go up and down the pitch at a high level. And he's got some qualities. He can play on the left and the right.",
      "\"So at the same time, defensively he's really solid. As I said, his individual performances have been strong in a disappointing season. He's been really good.\"",
      "Wan-Bissaka was offensively limited during his time at United, but his defensive quality in one-on-one situations was excellent and regarded among the finest in the Premier League.",
      "Wan-Bissaka left United having made 190 appearances, scoring two goals for the club."

      "Nothing at Man Utd is as bad as it seems\nRuben Amorim seems like a decent man, and his admission after the West Ham game has sent the gossip machine into overdrive about his leaving the job. However, in the direst of dire seasons, it’s worth looking for signs of hope. Here are a few:",
      "This team had turned a corner around March, and while not winning games, was showing signs of solidity, especially against the top teams. But the dual challenges of the Europa League and the PL have meant the constant prioritisation of the former, in the last 4 weeks. So we’ve had a somewhat weakened team in the PL games, especially in defence.",
      "Harry Amass is far from Premier League ready, he probably needs to go on loan to a Championship clubs and play a season of punishing physical football. But as a team it’s clear that the Europa is being prioritised which I’m sure impacts the mental state of all players on the pitch.",
      "I’d really like to see a quantitative analysis of the injuries suffered by PL teams. Every team feels that they were unlucky with injuries, but I suspect United (and Spurs) have had it quite bad this year. Every time a player gains a little form he seems to go off for a few weeks (or months), for us. Martinez, Zirkzee, Dalot, De Ligt have all gotten injured just as a run of regular games in the right position was bringing them into some kind of confident form. Others like Mount, Mainoo, Amad, Maguire, and Shaw have had months out and have had to be nursed back with managed minutes.",
      "The lack of a settled defence is particularly debilitating – we seem to have had about seventeen thousand combinations of the back 3 in one season. The 18 year old Tyler Fredricson played well on the left in his first game, but then on the right versus Brentford. Lindelof’s confidence is so low, he might as well be playing his first professional game. Mazroui has been running on fumes lately, and Dalot is out for the season it seems. DeLigt has been in and out. Ayden Heaven looked great, for the few games he played before he went off injured. But he’s only 18. Shaw is still feeling his way in. Yoro is now injured – let’s hope not for too long.",
      "Dorgu is still relatively new to the PL and he’s 20 years old. Especially given the physicality of the PL, it’s a real challenge for the young players to come up to scratch physically and mentally. If we had a consistent run with say Maguire, DeLigt and Martinez as the settled back 3, with Yoro as the option, and with Mazraoi and Shaw able to step in occasionally – I think this season goes differently. Not to mention the cliche of the impact the lack of a settled defence on the goalkeeper.",
      "At the other end, it’s all about poor Hojlund. The one striker on whom everybody depends, who is so out of form that he couldn’t score a pint at a brewery. And yet there are no options here, with the Rashford meltdown, and Garnacho who is good for the odd worldy but generally unreliable with his decision making. And when your main striker isn’t scoring goals, the opposition find it easy to block the other routes. If your striker is in form, it also opens up opportunities for others to score.",
      "This is a feast or famine situation and United are most definitely in a famine. In the past few games we’ve created more chances than the opposition, but when you’re not scoring goals it always puts more pressure on the defence.",
      "How much of this is fixable? My argument is that Amorim desperately finds a way to bring consistency to his backline – whether through luck, or finding more indestructible defenders. And he needs at least 2 front players who are capable of scoring in the range of 20 goals a season. If the combined sales of Garnacho, Sancho, and Rashford allow for (say) Cunha and Liam Delap – it would be a different team.",
      "The midfield is actually quite competitive when everybody is fit and at the top of their game. When you can combine Dalot/Mazraoui/Amad on the left, and Dorgu/Leon (incoming)/Shaw on the right, with Mainoo, Bruno, Casemiro (managed minutes), and Ugarte in the middle. Sure, another solid DM wouldn’t hurt with the money we save from Eriksen and Lindelof salaries.",
      "None of this is to suggest that United will become CL contenders overnight. There’s a lot more missing in terms of chemistry and style. But maybe Amorim deserves one preseason and even then I’ll take a good run that gets us into the Europa League next season.",

After 40 years of being one, I don’t think I can carry on being a Liverpool fan.",

For the last time, players do not owe it to you to sign a contract just to get the club a fee!!! This narrative is genuinely pathetic. He signed a 4 year deal. He fulfilled his end of the bargain. If he had signed a 6-year deal and then said he wanted to leave, I absolutely 100% know for certain that you would be criticising him for wanting to leave mid-contract.",
      "“It is that egotistical video that for some reason the club shared during the season. Wait until after the parade! But see above. He wants out asap to play for a European rival.” There is literally no club that Trent could move to that would not be a “European Rival”.",

      "Trent has been a starring member of the team that has won it all and brought LFC to 20 English titles. He should be (and is) a club legend. The fact that is is being criticised for seeing out his contract, rather than handing in a transfer request mid-contract is just utterly bizarre. He should have got a huge ovation and we wish him well as he goes off to a new challenge. Instead, pathetic, small minded idiots chose to see him leave under a cloud.",

      "We’ve been pretty down on this Premier League season at various points so let’s give credit where it’s due: that was a brilliant weekend.",
      "And the not-so-secret reason why it was such a brilliant weekend? Misery. Despair. Hearts breaking in two.",
      "We haven’t yet fully recovered from the saccharine, sickly sweet response to Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win, an event we were all instructed was one of great wondrousness that we should all be enjoying. We were baffled then and remain baffled now.",
      "Why should anyone other than Newcastle fans be delighted about Newcastle winning something?",
      "What we do understand is why for plenty of other ‘neutral’ supporters it was the more desirable outcome from the final. Everton supporters, for instance. Manchester United supporters. Any fans who find Liverpool’s This Means More exceptionalism more grating than Newcastle’s Best Fans in the World exceptionalism.",
      "And that brings us to the key point underpinning so much of football fandom. It’s not just about nice things happening to your team; it’s about bad things happening to other teams. And not necessarily even ones you particularly dislike.",
      "When you stop and think about it, this is obvious. If we had to rely on the joy our own teams actually provide us then almost all of us would surely have packed up the daft idea of following a football team years ago. For the vast majority of clubs the joy-despair ratio is all wrong.",
      "No, what keeps us coming back over and over is the fact that no matter what guff and nonsense your lot might be up to, at least someone else somewhere is showing more of their arse.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "Now to be clear here, we’re not subscribers to the idea that rivals’ disappointment should be more important than your own success. There’s a sliding scale here, but this is where we’d place ourselves: Spurs fans being quite happy to lose to Man City and scupper Arsenal’s league hopes at no great cost to themselves (avoiding Champions League qualification last season could yet prove their best decision in decades…) is absolutely fine, but Spurs fans who would settle for the hypothetical scenario of them not winning the Europa League if it meant Arsenal not winning the Champions League is too much.",
      "But the disappointment and upset of others is still a huge part of being a football fan and it’s ridiculous to pretend otherwise. It’s one more reason why we didn’t really understand that whole Newcastle thing. Knowing other fans are having their piss boiled to dangerous levels is a huge contributing factor to what makes your own success so enjoyable.",
      "Why would you want everyone else to be happy about it? Where’s the fun in that? This applies to success both large and small, too. Do Liverpool fans enjoy their title win more or less because it’s caused Mikel Arteta’s salty head to fall off? Do Southampton fans enjoy their point against Man City more or less because it’s caused Ruben Dias’ salty head to fall off?",
      "The whole guard of honour discourse is quite silly, but its existence tells us that deep down we all know this phenomenon is real. The idea of seeing Chelsea or Arsenal or whoever forced into this weird ritual humiliation by a luckless quirk of the fixture list is deeply enjoyable for everyone else.",
      "Which brings us back to this weekend and why it was so good: because so few people were actually happy.",
      "Man City weren’t happy because Southampton decided to actually defend against them, which is in fairness quite poor etiquette when they haven’t bothered with it against anyone else for 35 games.",
      "Arsenal aren’t happy because they’ve won nothing again and have dread fear about multiple potential banter outcomes to this season.",
      "Even Liverpool weren’t happy at their latest Anfield title party because they had simply no choice but to boo a player who has helped deliver everything those fans had craved for 30 years but now fancies playing for the biggest football club on earth for a bit.",
      "Chelsea: not happy.",
      "Man United and Spurs: involved in what is perhaps the all-time greatest season-long act of piss-boiling ever conceived, one which can now only end with one of those clubs as happy as a dog with two dicks while the other hits new depths of despair and everyone else is furious about one side of the equation and laughing their bollocks clear off about the other.",
      "They are, therefore, clearly the two standout clubs of this season and we have no notes. The fact they have now become so committed to ensuring they finish 16th and 17th to maximise the emotional extremes at the end of it all is truly magnificent.",
      "Even Nottingham Forest have found a way to bring misery upon themselves in a season that now brings a guaranteed place in European competition next season. The owner is literally on the pitch having a go at the manager because they might now only finish seventh.",
      "Here, then, is just another way this game is far more about misery than joy. Because the shift in expectations that follows things like Forest’s profoundly unlikely-looking season means that ‘We’d have given everything to be precisely where we are now back in August’ ends up meaning two-fifths of f*ck all in reality even though its logic is utterly impeccable.",
      "Do we have any actual problem with Nottingham Forest? Not really. Did we nevertheless take perverse and extreme delight in pinpointing the precise moment yesterday where their hearts broke in two? Of course we did.",
      "And don’t pretend you didn’t feel it too.",
      "Social media and ragebait and the wider collapse of society in general may have all helped hasten football’s descent into rabid and often unhealthy tribalism, but let’s not pretend the despair of others hasn’t always been an absolute core element of fan culture.",
      "We all love to hate."

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou cannot complain that their preparations for a ludicrously important game have been shocking. Newcastle are flying.",
      "",
      "Leicester\nIf annoying your rivals represents the high point of a season it has not gone especially well. But fair play because that is a very funny bit.",
      "",
      "Newcastle\nIt could have gone two different ways. Newcastle ending their long trophy drought might just as easily have derailed the rest of their season, the instinct to celebrate and that release of pent-up emotion providing the most intoxicating and understandable distraction imaginable.",
      "But harnessed properly, it was always a potential springboard for something not greater and certainly not as tangible, but definitely more beneficial in the long run. While Newcastle cannot put Champions League qualification alongside the Carabao Cup in their trophy cabinet, it means more for their future aspirations.",
      "And no team has earned more Premier League points since the Carabao final than winners Newcastle, who have used that platform and momentum to surge past almost all of their rivals into prime position:",
      "These games really do suit them like no other. Newcastle have played members of the Big Six eight times at St James’ Park this season, winning six, drawing two, scoring 17 goals and conceding six. Those results formed a crucial part of their Carabao glory and seem likely to do the same with this Champions League push.",
      "",
      "Simon Rusk\nPerhaps only Eddie Howe, Thomas Frank, Oliver Glasner, Vitor Pereira and David Moyes have met their Premier League job requirements as specifically and definitively as Rusk this season. The man responsible for a quarter of Southampton’s points and two-thirds of their clean sheets having taken charge of just one sixth of their games has crossed an underwhelming but entirely necessary finish line nonetheless.",
      "In dragging Southampton beyond record-breakingly dreadful and into the mere realm of historically poor without the stigma attached, Rusk has delivered on his remit and bruised some egos along the way.",
      "The 43-year-old should be allowed to step back into a permanent role on the first-team coaching staff in the summer under whichever poor sap is chosen to lead their Championship promotion charge. Rusk has shown enough to suggest he is worth keeping around.",
      "He is also one of five managers to face and never lose to Pep Guardiola in the Premier League, and probably in time the toughest of those quiz question answers alongside former Middlesbrough caretaker Steve Agnew.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nFour straight wins for the first time in their Premier League history has turned European qualification from distant chance to distinct possibility for Brentford. Their home and away form has finally aligned at the perfect time and the injuries have abated.",
      "It is a ridiculous achievement for them to be eighth, with the ritual sacrifice of their domestic cup hopes entirely vindicated if Europa Conference League football can be secured.",
      "Selling your star striker and scoring more goals than all but the current top four is wild. Frank is a ludicrously good coach, even if it does still feel as though he would be sacked within six months if appointed anywhere else.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOne point from setting a new club-record Premier League tally after doing the double over Spurs, Manchester United and Brighton, with the FA Cup final to follow this weekend.",
      "One man will be particularly devastated but Oliver Glasner is doing phenomenal work.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe success of their January transfer gamble depends exclusively on reaching the Champions League, but Aston Villa qualifying for Europe through league position for a third straight season is an underrated accomplishment that surprisingly few teams have managed in recent years.",
      "Unai Emery’s worth is undoubted but he continues to prove it in circumstances such as these. Away at Bournemouth without Youri Tielemans and Marcus Rashford, the Spaniard figured that Villa’s best chance was also without the ball. And that in itself was a risk, considering their six lowest shares of Premier League possession this season had returned five defeats and a draw.",
      "Their four lowest shares of Premier League possession in 2023/24 yielded three defeats and a draw. It is not Villa’s typical game to sit back and soak up pressure.",
      "But against Bournemouth it was an inspirational call, with a more rudimentary defensive four than usual helping combine Ollie Watkins’ record-breaking goal with a clean sheet.",
      "The key to their season has been in games against the teams around them. Only Liverpool have more points against the top half than Villa (28), who have done better in just one Premier League season – the 42-game inaugural campaign of 1992/93. That is down to a change in mindset overseen wonderfully by the manager.",
      "Of course, it won’t be relevant for their final two games against the teams in 16th and 17th. But Villa have played a blinder in saving these miserable, preoccupied versions of Manchester United and Spurs til last.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nNo club has been behind in fewer Premier League games so the opportunities to do so have been limited, but had Arsenal been able to turn more of their deficits into draws or wins their season would have a vastly different complexion.",
      "As it is, recovering from two quickfire first-half goals at Anfield to draw 2-2 even against a slightly absent Liverpool provided welcome proof that they retain those powers of recovery.",
      "",
      "Conor Bradley\nHe might well get a statue at this rate.",
      "",
      "Beto\nIt might be that Moyes is able to resist the obvious temptation to sign Marko Arnautovic, whose Inter contract expires at the end of the season and will not be renewed. The success of Beto as his latest centre-forward reclamation project should offset any desperate transfer moves at least.",
      "There was one sensational line from the Everton manager about the Guinean’s progress. “He’s done great, he’s improving,” Moyes said. “If he was a 19-year-old striker you’d say he’s got a bit to go, he’s not but he’s certainly improving,” he added of a 27-year-old who cannot afford to coast on potential.",
      "Nor does he have any inclination. Moyes mentioning how Beto trains “like you wouldn’t believe” and “is really trying” is a better indication of his standing under the Scot than the seven goals he has scored in 17 games since his appointment – as many as he mustered in 50 Sean Dyche appointments.",
      "No player has scored more goals in the Premier League this season without providing a single assist, and that narrowed focus between the posts has worked wonders. Unless Leeds offer stupid money, Beto has a part to play in this sustained Everton revival.",
      "",
      "Brighton\nFrom a recent Winners and Losers:",
      "‘It will be a close-run thing but Yasin Ayari’s stunning strike against West Ham has given Brighton a chance. They have pulled level with Arsenal for the most different scorers in the Premier League this season (16 each) and can claim the crown outright over the next four games.",
      "‘Brajan Gruda seems like the safest bet but Lewis Dunk could continue his resurgence with a goal and if worst comes to worst, Bart Verbruggen can be sent up for a corner on the final day.’",
      "Fabian Hurzeler knows what he must do. Verbruggen securing Conference League qualification by sending a goal kick flying over Fraser Forster’s head is written in the stars.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka\n“I can’t say this categorically because I don’t know Aaron’s career, but I can’t imagine he’s played as well as he has for us at this point in his career,” said Graham Potter of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who set up the clinching goal against his former club to render this his joint-best Premier League season in terms of an attacking return.",
      "It’s difficult to imagine he’s played many clever reverse passes in the build-up to a goal at Old Trafford either.",
      "Two goals and four assists is not especially productive but the full-back’s improvement in that department has been obvious. In a season of unrelenting suffering for West Ham his £15m signing and six-year contract offers hope.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE REACTION FROM F365\n👉 European qualification latest: Forest follow Manchester City in squandering huge chance\n👉 Trent replaced in Premier League XI of the season by proper defender\n👉 Premier League prize money table revealed with Liverpool breaking Manchester City record",
      "Manchester United and Spurs\nThere have been games with bigger stakes before, but surely none with such a ridiculous gulf between the potential reward for victory and further embarrassment inflicted by defeat.",
      "It is difficult to recall the last fixture both teams so willingly torched their entire seasons for. Neither Manchester United nor Spurs were particularly wrong to have prioritised the Europa League basically since the knockout stage commenced, but the idea their Premier League form had to be offered as an unavoidable sacrifice is preposterous – not least because their apparent advantage over continental opposition will be entirely redundant in the final.",
      "Both Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou made reference to “the levels” needing to be higher after their latest defeats, with surprise that players could not step up and motivate themselves for games the managers have openly written off in terms of importance.",
      "Their approaches in the build-up have been different, with Amorim publicly wondering whether Champions League qualification might actually be worse for his players, rather ignoring how it should offset the need for any more unnecessary job losses throughout the club, while Postecoglou has made no attempt to hide what it would mean for Spurs.",
      "But both have essentially said for months that these games don’t really matter, as their combined 37 Premier League defeats bear out. “Who cares if we’re struggling in the league? It’s a separate thing,” Postecoglou said in a fair reaction after reaching the Europa final, but that sentiment inevitably transmits through the squad.",
      "The result is two Premier League teams entering a stupidly important one-off game in wilfully abysmal form, and as much as the lucrative and glorious plaster on offer for the winners has been highlighted, it doesn’t feel like nearly enough has been made of what the loser will be left with: a historically bad campaign, a squad with shattered confidence, a manager with at best an uncertain future and a summer which must go perfectly just to stabilise themselves.",
      "",
      "Ruben Dias\nIt had been a while since someone associated with Manchester City decidedly to actively soil themselves in protest at an insolent team not rolling over to have their bellies tickled.",
      "If ever a season was going to properly humble and shame that dormant side of self-important, condescending arrogance Pep Guardiola seemed to have suppressed within his squad it would be this one – the reigning champions’ worst of the Spaniard’s reign by far.",
      "And to be fair to Guardiola, he outright dismissed the suggestion Southampton were somehow to blame for Manchester City’s failings.",
      "“They can do whatever they want. It’s on us to break them. They didn’t do much but we have to accept the way they play. I don’t agree with Ruben. We have to accept it,” is absolutely right.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that the aversion to introspection so proudly worn by one of their leaders does not pervade a side in no position whatsoever to snipe at the way other teams play. It was always curious when they blamed those rare slips at their peak on the opposition choosing not to hand three points over, but feeling the need to punch so far down when they have been laughably short of their own standards all campaign is embarrassing.",
      "Manchester City had largely outgrown that finger-pointing, responsibility-shirking part of their identity, and any rebuild should involve restoring it. As eagerly awaited as Rodri’s comeback is, it would be regrettable if it heralds the return of Manchester City’s sore loser edge too.",
      "",
      "Erling Haaland\nThe Are Manchester City Better Without Erling Haaland narrative strand will never die. A ten-year contract ought to have rendered such talk null and void but Guardiola’s side were notably worse for the Norwegian’s presence against Southampton.",
      "The strikerless 4-2-2-2 formation had been refined to the point Manchester City were on their longest winning streak since October, and sacrificing it to give Haaland the full 90 minutes on his return felt like a mistake.",
      "Guardiola “did not expect” Southampton to set up so defensively and simply said of Haaland’s lack of supply that “Erling needs people to deliver balls to him” regardless of what position they play, but it does feel as though his effectiveness is contingent on using wingers, which in turn relies on there being the sort of stable midfield Manchester City cannot currently offer.",
      "If Rodri cannot make it for the FA Cup final then there could be a good old-fashioned Guardiola overthink in reverting back to the system which inspired Manchester City to beat Crystal Palace 5-2 just one month ago. Omar Marmoush feels like the better option than Haaland right now.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva mentioned that “the last six or seven games” had not been good enough from Fulham, but it feels like the eighth in that sequence – the 3-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup quarter-final – was the most damaging.",
      "On the morning of that game, Fulham were eighth and three points off the Champions League places. But since then their form has been miserable, with only the two Europa League finalists and relegated three faring worse.",
      "The international break in March might have killed their momentum and that tendency to drop points from winning positions has become a particular problem. Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest have led more Premier League games than Fulham this season but the Cottagers seem to build their foundations on quicksand and have too frequently squandered those advantages.",
      "That result confirmed this to be a season of consolidation when so much more was promised.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson\nA quite silly thing to do for a player whose talents are obvious but his drawbacks no less so. The race between a player’s Premier League goals (24) and Premier League cards (18) should not be so close, particularly when his former manager outlined two years ago a need to be more disciplined which appears to have gone ignored.",
      "Another club might be more patient and accommodating; Chelsea are not that club.",
      "",
      "Wolves\n“I think this was the first match that I watched my team playing like this,” said Vitor Pereira, ruing how Wolves were governed by emotion and chaos and drawn into the “open, completely unpredictable game” Brighton would have preferred.",
      "Matheus Cunha leaned into the vibe by conceding a penalty after losing the ball on the edge of his own area, while Pablo Sarabia’s aimless switch was punished to the fullest degree.",
      "It was the first time in 17 games Wolves had lost by at least two goals, and not coincidentally the first time in a while Wolves played someone else’s game rather than their own.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nIt is starting to feel a little bit like those swashbuckling January wins cursed them. Bournemouth have not won consecutive Premier League games since dispatching Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in the space of a week so spectacularly four months ago.",
      "Their form since that pair of victories which left them seventh, a point behind both Manchester City and Newcastle, has been atrocious:",
      "Andoni Iraola emphasised the need to “manage the small things better,” presumably like not letting Tyrone Mings test the structural integrity of one’s jaw with his elbow. And when you consider Bournemouth have lost 13 games in all competitions this season, but the only two by more than one goal were both administered by Liverpool, you see his point.",
      "",
      "Ipswich\nThe record for fewest home points in a Premier League season remains seven, set by Sunderland in 2005/06. It is a bar Southampton (six) are set to clear, but Ipswich have only managed to match it while already conceding more goals at Portman Road than the Black Cats at the Stadium of Light two decades ago.",
      "Only four clubs have accrued more points away than at home, but none with such a drastic difference as Ipswich. If they are to return to this stage soon, correcting that must be the priority.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nAn undoubtedly frustrating result, performance and general petering out of a wonderful season, with Matz Sels still Golden Glove-bound despite not keeping a clean sheet in seven games.",
      "Forest are basically just knackered and really that is fine. More signings could have been made in January and fewer rotation risks taken in the FA Cup but neither would have guaranteed a better outcome and both came with risks Forest decided it was better not to take.",
      "How embarrassing to only maybe qualify for one of Europe’s lesser competitions after being projected to battle relegation for a third straight season. Definitely worth the owner staging a one-man pitch invasion.",
      "Ruben Dias has criticised Southampton for not simply bending over and letting Manchester City score eight goals at St Mary’s.",
      "Including a mere one Leicester City player, here is the worst Premier League XI of the weekend. Ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "Everton may well have a major transfer decision to make with David Moyes and the Friedkin Group set to make a bold call.",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has revealed that Ruben Dias could miss up to four weeks with a muscle issue after their Manchester derby loss last weekend."

      "As always, match ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "",
      "GK: Bernd Leno (Fulham) – 5.42\nLeno’s weak attempt to parry away Beto’s shot handed Everton an impressive away win, and that error earned the German a spot in the Premier League Worst XI. He has a pretty poor season by his standards.",
      "",
      "RB: Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest) – 5.80\nIt was a close call between Aina and Bournemouth’s Adam Smith (5.83), but the Nottingham Forest man makes the cut after a lacklustre performance in his side’s disappointing 2-2 draw against Leicester City.",
      "Aina picked up a yellow card, lost his only aerial duel, committed an error leading to a shot, and failed to make any tackles or interceptions.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.11\nManchester United have won six, drawn six, and lost 13 of their Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim. That is a diabolical record, and their latest defeat – at home to West Ham on Sunday – left them 16th in the table with a -11 goal difference.",
      "Say what you want about this being a transitional period, the players not being Amorim’s, or the focus being on Europe – this is still a squad worth over £700million in transfer fees and packed with international footballers. Amorim is embarrassed, and rightly so; winning the Europa League should not paper over the cracks of a worst-ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Anyway, rant over. Yoro struggled on Sunday before coming off injured.",
      "",
      "CB: Luke Shaw (Manchester United) – 5.90\nShaw played 52 minutes against West Ham, coming off alongside Yoro. He wasn’t injured – Amorim is simply managing his minutes carefully given his wretched injury record.",
      "Deployed at left centre-back in a back three, Shaw offered little defensive output: just one clearance, no interceptions, no tackles, and not a single aerial duel contested.",
      "",
      "LB: Harry Amass (Manchester United) – 5.76\nSticking with the shambles that is Manchester United, 18-year-old left wing-back Harry Amass made his fourth Premier League start in five games, which sounds promising until you realise he’s lost every single one, with an aggregate score of 11–4. Not ideal.",
      "United have now won just once in nine league matches, having seemingly written off their top-flight campaign the moment Ruben Amorim walked through the door.",
      "In their latest disappointment, Amass was dribbled past twice and probably shouldn’t have lasted the full 90 minutes.",
      "For the record, the lowest-rated actual left-back this week was Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (6.08).",
      "",
      "DM: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool) – 5.62\nIpswich’s Jack Taylor and Chelsea’s Romeo Lavia both had tough weekends, each recording a 5.78 match rating – but it’s Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch who claims the unwanted spot in this week’s worst XI.",
      "Arsenal came from two goals down at Anfield to salvage a point that should offer real encouragement heading into next season. They were helped by a toxic atmosphere following Trent Alexander-Arnold’s introduction, with the bizarre boos clearly unsettling Arne Slot’s side.",
      "Gravenberch, in particular, looked uncharacteristically unsettled. He was dribbled past once, failed with his only dribble attempt, misplaced four passes, made no interceptions, was dispossessed twice, committed one foul, and made an error leading to a shot.",
      "Fair play to Arsenal, who managed to rattle the Premier League’s best No.6 this season without Declan Rice.",
      "",
      "CM: Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United) – 5.74\nBack to the shambles at Old Trafford, is it? Hardly surprising that another goalless home defeat sees four Manchester United players in the worst XI – and rounding it off is £50m summer signing Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan lasted just 59 minutes after failing to make any meaningful impact, with a dreaded error leading to a shot contributing to his poor 5.74 rating.",
      "",
      "CM: Andreas Pereira (Fulham) – 5.66\nFulham took the lead against Everton in the most 3pm blackout fixture imaginable – but they never took control and ultimately slumped to a deserved 3-1 defeat.",
      "They lost the midfield battle, with Andreas Pereira and Sander Berge struggling to assert themselves. Pereira committed one error leading to a shot and lost possession nine times.",
      "It’s a limp ending to what has been a genuinely fantastic Premier League season. Fulham have now lost four of their last five matches, with their only win in that time coming against the second-worst team in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "RW: Matheus Cunha (Wolves) – 5.73\nCunha is gleefully aware that he is, by some distance, Wolves’ best player. With that status comes a sense of responsibility – one that seemingly compels him to drop all the way back into his own box to collect the ball from goal-kicks. Against a high-pressing Brighton side at Molineux, this proved costly. Caught in possession by Mats Wieffer, the Dutchman was brought down in the box for a stonewall penalty. Danny Welbeck converted from the spot to score his tenth Premier League goal of the season – the first time he’s reached double figures in a single campaign.",
      "It could have been worse for Cunha, who was fortunate not to be sent off for the last-man foul. There was no common sense applied by VAR, who deemed the double jeopardy rule sufficient to spare the Brazilian a red card. But watching the replay, it’s clear there was no attempt to play the ball – Cunha’s eyes are fixed on Wieffer before he deliberately brings him down.",
      "Oh well. Wolves still lost 2-0, so literally only I care about that.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) 5.27\nVilla secured a crucial 1-0 win at Bournemouth to keep their Champions League hopes alive. But on what had been a decent afternoon for Jacob Ramsey, a second yellow card ensured a nervy finish for Unai Emery and his players.",
      "They held on – but that doesn’t do Ramsey any favours here.",
      "",
      "ST: Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea) – 4.98\nSent off for an incredibly stupid assault on Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, Jackson seemed to have sabotaged Chelsea’s chances of a comeback in their biggest league game of the season. Oddly, though, Enzo Maresca’s side looked far better without him.",
      "Either way, he was a shoo-in the moment that first-half red card was shown.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘preparing a massive outlay’ to ‘secure’ three Premier League stars as ‘key signings’ this summer.",
      "PGMOL has been asked to consider John Brooks’ future as a Premier League official after Nicolas Jackson’s red card for Chelsea vs Newcastle.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is a fool but Chelsea were much better without him anyway. Newcastle were very good then pretty bad, but we can’t imagine they give a damn.",

      "Remember when ‘playing on a Thursday night’ was uttered as an insult? A symbol of a club’s failure to get in the Champions League. Treated as a kind of curse, the Europa League just got in the way of the important business of earning free money in the Premier League from a higher finish. Money which could be frittered away on second-rate talent, of course.",
      "The PFMs sat with their legs apart and held it in contempt, very much the glass of dry white white wine to their three bottles of strong Barolo and they would put out weakened sides in order to get knocked out as soon as possible.",
      "“It’s one of those competitions that teams get in and then they try to get out of,” said Harry Redknapp who spoke and, to an extent still speaks, for this viewpoint. Playing on a Thursday and Sunday was spuriously claimed to upset players’ delicate biorhythms.",
      "“It takes an even bigger toll in my opinion, that’s the problem. That Thursday night one, every week, and playing Sundays every week…it’s not ideal,” said Redknapp, a physiological expert in his own lunchtime. Is he saying it now that it’s much easier for rubbish Premier League teams to get to a final?",
      "Foreign clubs could cope, of course, but not the delicate Premier League players. Some fans bought this line of bullsh*t and still cling to it, for some reason downplaying one of the few trophies that can be won in a season, having written out an ordered list of trophy importance, based on nothing but some invented truths only they believe.",
      "But now it’s an all-English final, they seem to have decided to take it seriously in a way they did not when Porto beat Braga or Sevilla remarkably won it three times consecutively. Or perhaps we do now because the manager that achieved that feat works in the Premier League so must now be respected. That’s how English exceptionalism works.",
      "Much humour has been derived from Manchester United playing Spurs. Two absolutely chronic bin fires who are both some shade of disgraceful. But the Premier League rewards even the worst with more than £100million of free money; no one from Europe can compete with that.",
      "The truth is, as anyone who watches European football will tell you, other leagues are certainly more regularly entertaining and there are loads of great players who have no interest in playing for an English club. Even though they might earn more, they know that’s not the most important thing. But the teams they play for have diminishing chances of doing well because of simple economics.",
      "A lot of the best players, but not all, have been drawn to the Premier League. That doesn’t mean they play the most entertaining football, of course, but the weight of numbers and overall quality are having an effect because of the sheer volume and depth of resources in favour of the Premier League.",
      "The imbalance is now so massive that it just can’t be ignored, best expressed with Spurs playing Bodo/Glimt. The disparity of resources was profound. Just in case you don’t know how profound, Bodo had one player in the squad worth six million Euro, Spurs had 26 worth more. Now, you don’t have to be critical of this competitive imbalance to recognise that it exists and must influence results. Imagine if, say, rubbish Italian clubs had such an advantage. It’d feel unfair wouldn’t it? Not that it’s possible to totally even out resources and we accept there’ll be differences. It’s the extent of the disparities, not the disparities per se.",
      "As the Premier League becomes ever more financially dominant, it will obviously have an impact on European competitions, especially outside of equally financially dominant sides in the Champions League. Even these rubbish Premier League sides can’t be competed with and they are really terrible. Is it desirable that this should be the case? We’re now at a stage where only a handful of clubs can win any European trophy.",
      "For example, watching Chelsea beat Djurgårdens wasn’t interesting for anyone not a Chelsea fan because of their altogether vastly superior resources. It’s like if they got to an FA Cup final by beating Walsall. You’d think, well, so what? Of course they did.",
      "When West Ham won the Conference League, only when they beat Fiorentina in the final did they play any side even vaguely near their resources. It was hailed as a great victory, but how great was it really? You wouldn’t think that if they won the FA Cup after only playing third or fourth-tier sides and then beat a top Championship side in the final.",
      "If money means anything at all, the Europa and Conference League final should always be between English clubs and if they were as good as is often claimed they are, probably the Champions League too.",
      "Part of the fun of football is not knowing the outcome of games but when fixtures are so imbalanced, you inevitably do. The argument for a separate European money league grows ever stronger the more the gap widens. You just want teams to have a decent chance and right now, that chance is diminishing every year.",
      "It’s not even just about the winners so much as just doing well. How does UEFA pass these tournaments off as proper competitions, because they’re not. Maybe they want them to harden around a few teams. Predictability attracts more investment after all, so the last thing they want is unpredictability.",
      "The Thursday night curse may have been lifted from Premier League clubs just at a time when the competitions are having their competitiveness undermined by grotesque financial imbalance."

When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",

      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",

      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",

      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",

      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "9) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.3\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "10) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.3\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "11) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +1.3\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",

      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Now being saved for the Europa League.",
      "",
      "13) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.0\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine.

But he under-conceded v Liverpool to drag himself level for the season.",

Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

      "West Ham became the sixth team to complete a Premier League double over Man Utd this season in numbers which should shame any post-Ferguson decision-maker.",
      "Julen Lopetegui masterminded the 2-1 win which prompted Erik ten Hag’s sacking in October, meaning Graham Potter completed a surprise league double for West Ham over Manchester United with that victory.",
      "Five teams did it a combined 14 times under Sir Alex Ferguson – including West Ham themselves – but since his retirement in 2013, 13 sides have completed 16 such doubles between them.",
      "",
      "Manchester City – three times (in 2013/14, 2018/19 and 2023/24)\nGames have been raised and pretend (and actual) cup finals won by all manner of Man Utd managers for and in this fixture, from Louis van Gaal to Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and even Amorim. But Pep Guardiola has managed to overcome such ridiculousness a couple of times and Manuel Pellegrini needed those six points to help deliver a title.",
      "",
      "Brighton – two times (in 2022/23 and 2024/25)\nNever before had Brighton completed a league double over Man Utd until they bookended an actually decent Ten Hag season with a pair of defeats, including Alexis Mac Allister’s 99th-minute winning penalty at the Amex. Then Fabian Hurzeler repeated the feat in just the worst campaign.",
      "",
      "Liverpool – two times (in 2013/14 and 2021/22)\nIt really should have been more, and indeed Liverpool will be frustrated to have completed more Premier League doubles in 21 attempts against Ferguson’s Man Utd than in 12 tries against the incompetent mess he left behind. Considering how generally excellent the Reds have been in that time it is especially curious that Jurgen Klopp could only do it as often as Brendan Rodgers – and that was against the risible combined efforts of Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "",
      "West Ham – one time (in 2024/25)\nWhile many Hammers will still fondly remember the work of Alans Pardew and Curbishley in beating Man Utd 1-0 home and away to help secure Premier League safety in 2006/07, for many the double act of Julen and Graham will be the first taste of that particular double. Lopetegui got Erik ten Hag the sack in October before himself being replaced in January by Potter, who finished the job with a win at Old Trafford in May.",
      "",
      "Wolves – one time (2024/25)\nVitor Pereira was only appointed in December of the 2024/25 season but he still managed to guide Wolves to their first league double over Man Utd since 1979/80 by masterminding entirely deserved wins by 2-0 at Molineux and 1-0 at Old Trafford, the latter taking them level on points with their hosts in the league table despite being 17th for most of the campaign.",
      "",
      "Newcastle – one time (in 2024/25)\nSo confident were Newcastle that the demons of Kevin Keegan could finally be exorcised that they trusted Jason Tindall to finish the job at St James’ Park. A swashbuckling 4-1 thrashing was about as dominant as the 2-0 victory the Magpies secured at Old Trafford a few months prior. For the first time since 1930/31, the Magpies beat their tormentors home and away in a season.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest – one time (in 2024/25)\nChris Wood was impossibly tall, all elbows and an absolute handful for the babysitter when at five months old he witnessed Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest put Man Utd down in March and April of 1992. Over 30 years later he helped ensure history would repeat itself but Anthony Elanga was by far the more embarrassing goalscorer.",
      "",
      "Spurs – one time (in 2024/25)\nIn an abysmal and very possibly sack-worthy domestic season for Ange Postecoglou, almost one-fifth of his total league wins have come against Man Utd. Spurs completed their first league double over the Red Devils since 1989/90 with a 3-0 hammering at Old Trafford before James Maddison fed Roy Keane a few of his words in north London.",
      "",
      "Arsenal – one time (in 2023/24)\nThe tide has only recently turned definitively in favour of Arsenal, who had waited so long to vanquish Man Utd that Emmanuel Adebayor and Thierry Henry were their heroes on the most recent such occasion. The roles were recast for Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard 17 years later.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace – one time (in 2023/24)\nHaving never beaten Manchester United twice in a league season, Palace made it look mightily easy when they followed up 1-0 win at Old Trafford in September with a proper paddling at Selhurst Park the following April. That was the Casemiro “leave the football before the football leaves you” game; it was an absolute humiliation.",
      "",
      "Swansea – one time (in 2014/15)\nPerhaps the most surprising side to take advantage of this hilariously embarrassing era to register their first league double over a club which must technically be described as Man Utd was Swansea. Their highest-ever Premier League finish of 8th was at least in some part supported by a couple of 2-1 wins, with Ki Sung-yueng scoring in both. The great man is still playing, and even being captained by Jesse Lingard at FC Seoul, no less.",
      "",
      "Everton – one time (in 2013/14)\nThe schadenfreude was wonderful as Man Utd handpicked Everton’s manager as their Ferguson replacement and the Toffees promptly dealt out a pair of results which contributed heavily to his demise. David Moyes was sacked a couple of days after Goodison Park revelled in that second win, the first obviously having been secured by a Bryan Oviedo goal.",

      "Liverpool thanked them by securing a 3-0 win at Elland Road that set two unbroken top-flight records: most points in a top-flight season with two for a win (68); and fewest goals conceded in a 42-game campaign (16).",

      "Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)\nTwo terrible transfer windows have seen Arsenal go backwards for the first time in a couple of seasons, with Mikel Arteta and his increasingly underwhelming squad facing some justified scrutiny.",
      "Injuries have played their part, but this excuse has been overused by Arteta and his players; their performances have simply not been good enough, and this includes club captain Odegaard.",
      "The Norway international has gone from being one of the Premier League’s most creative players to an ineffective midfielder offering very little, but he’s perhaps been a victim of Arsenal lacking a clinical edge ahead of him, while his and Bukayo Saka’s injuries also seem to have dampened his spirits.",
      "The upcoming transfer window is promising to be the ‘biggest of a generation’, with the focus on bolstering the striking and wide areas. Odegaard should only benefit from having more high-quality teammates to link up with.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nCold Cole has become lukewarm after being one of the only credible challengers to Mohamed Salah in the race for the POTS award in the early months of this season, with his 12-game Premier League goal drought leading to justified calls for the England international to be dropped.",
      "In a remarkable debut season, Palmer emphatically bucked the trend of Todd Boehly-era Chelsea signings to swiftly become the big fish in a “toxic” pond, but he’s been dragged down by his inferior teammates this term as a dip in confidence has made him seem ordinary.",
      "His goalless spell ended against Liverpool to cap off a great performance as he returned to being at the forefront of everything positive from Chelsea in the attacking half, albeit against the off-the-ball champions.",
      "It was always going to be difficult for Palmer to maintain his freakishly high standards and he has regressed this season, but his showing against Liverpool was an encouraging sign of things to come next season.",
      "READ: Mikel Arteta mid-table in Premier League manager rankings topped by staggering Slot",
      "",
      "Andy Robertson (Liverpool)\nArne Slot has done very little wrong in his debut season at Anfield, getting more out of Jurgen Klopp’s squad than Liverpool’s beloved former boss, but there have been a few exceptions and Robertson has struggled.",
      "It’s been disheartening to see the once-great Robertson look past it this season as the years of breathless running under Klopp catch up with him.",
      "From indispensable to a weak link, Robertson has been a shadow of his former self this season and it’s no surprise that the signing of a new left-back is a priority for Liverpool, with Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez mooted as a top target.",
      "With Kostas Tsimikas failing to convince as deputy, Kerkez’s arrival should seal his exit.",
      "Robertson will then compete for starts with the Hungarian, and as the presence of a quality rival reduces the 31-year-old’s number of starts, the elder left-back could have a second wind with his energy exerted on selected matches in a reduced role.",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw (Manchester United)\nShaw’s last two seasons have mirrored Mount’s, with the full-back only making 14 Premier League starts since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "When Shaw was last fully fit for a sustained spell, he was arguably the best left-back in the Premier League, but injuries have seriously damaged his career and kept him from consistently hitting the heights he once promised as a teenager.",
      "Shaw has been eased back into the fold in recent weeks and, like Mount, he could be a hugely important player for Amorim. Shaw can be a natural wing-back who can contribute in each half, or a solid left centre-back option, if he can stay fit for a sustained period.",
      "",
      "Micky van de Ven (Tottenham Hotspur)\nVan de Ven is another Premier League defender damaged by injuries. His season has been derailed by muscle issues after his stunning debut season in 2023/24.",
      "The Dutchman is already the real deal, but he has all the necessary qualities to lead Tottenham to another level, or, more likely, leave for a European giant.",
      "This season has been a write-off for Van de Ven with mismanagement delaying his return to full fitness, but a free summer will do him the world of good with brighter horizons ahead under Ange Postecoglou’s successor, with Champions League football possible.",
      "Arsenal have not shown the sort of ruthlessness needed to cross the finish line. It doesn’t even need to be Mikel Arteta who moves on either.",
      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Man Utd secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea legend Frank Leboeuf has hit out at Arsenal star Martin Odegaard after his ‘4/10’ performance against Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Ally McCoist feels Arsenal have “got to start” Martin Odegaard against Paris Saint-Germain, as he discussed calls for Ethan Nwaneri to be given the nod.",
      "Cole Palmer forgot the golden rule of live TV as he delivered an honest interview in the wake of breaking his Chelsea goal drought.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard has hit out at the Gunners’ performance as they lost 2-1 to Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "“You can be good in your club, in your league, but when you go to the Premier League, it’s different,” Gallas said.",
      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",
      "“But sometimes you can’t wait, you need a striker who can score right away. That would be my concern about Gyokeres. I would go for Isak, because he is already proven in the Premier League. He’s already posing problems and already knows how to deal with the opponents.”",

It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",

The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it. I suspect Amorim’s system may reveal exactly what kind of player he is, and that he may end up being a damn good one.\nAkillies, Malawi",

PSG are in here, but really need to win something other than League 1.",
      "The third tier are clubs that were once powerful but time has moved on and they are now operating in small leagues, Ajax, Benfica and the like. A team that seeing their jersey makes you nostalgic but you know they will never be back at the top table. Forest and Villa may be dancing around the edges of this group for English football fans of a certain vintage, but they are more sparkling wine than champagne.",
      "The fourth tier is for clubs that do alright every so often, have a bit of success in their own league but don’t stir the juices. This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",

Tottenham may have a shiny stadium and Brentford may be well run but they just don’t cut it. Celtic probably reside here, not enough European success to be in the third tier.",

      "Recently its gone past the bile and hatred and in to the downright bizarre as people scratch their heads to try to think of the reasons why they hate Arsenal and Arteta so much without coming to the conclusion that they hate them more now they are a very good team but less so when we weren’t a very good team.",
      "The latest was Arsenal players aren’t ‘manly’ [more on this juicy debate below] they are the types of men who will chat up the secretary despite being married, are not the type of men willing to work hard all their life and die early of a heart attack, and we are being forced to imagine Arteta as Field Marshall Montgomery and what a terrible job he’d have done leading proud Britain in to battle against the Nazi’s, and finally that Arsenal are hated more than the very idea of state funded football teams sportwashing and cheating their way through football? If you’re not an Arsenal fan and Arteta and Arsenal cause you this much rage and causes you to think up these strange analogies and reasons to hate them/him then I think you probably need to step back from the internet, football and re-assess yourself a bit.",
      "There has been a lot of talk of ‘hate watching’ recently, I think its growing massively, particularly with the growth of social media as a pretty toxic environment, it feels no longer is it enough to be happy with what you like, you actually live more for slamming others, getting what you feel is one over them, delight in any perceived failure and the misery of others.",

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 09:43, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "West Ham inflicted a 17th Premier League defeat of the season on Manchester United as the Europa League finalists continued to struggle.",
      "There was a celebratory mood at Old Trafford after United's Europa League exploits last Thursday and the home side, who made six changes from the side that set up a final clash with Tottenham on May 21, started brightly.",
      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",
      "The three points moves West Ham above Man Utd into 15th. Meanwhile, United, who have now suffered back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford, are without a league win since March 16.",
      "\"If you look at the goals that we suffer, we can avoid these goals. The lack of energy, of urgency. That is the most dangerous things in this club. You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",
      "\"It's something we need to work on. It's inside the pitch and outside the pitch. If we are not able to do, we have to go away and give the space to different people. All of us.",
      "\"We are going to face a team from Premier League so we are going to struggle. Of course we are going to be more focused, and that is a concern because we have to be focused every game.",
      "\"For me, it doesn't matter if we win the Europa League because the problems are much bigger than that.\"",
      "Manchester United suffered their ninth home Premier League defeat of the season, their joint-most ever home losses in a single league campaign, along with 1930/31, 1933/34, and 1962/63.",
      "United have fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024/25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most ever in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023/24.",
      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two.",
      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",
      "You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could improve greatly next season.",
      "West Ham goalscorer Tomas Soucek:",
      "\"It's always great. I'm so proud of how we played. Last week we played in a similar style and we wanted to show how much we want to play for West Ham. We got three points today and I thought it was fully deserved.",
      "\"We were all together and fought for every ball. We had great pressing. When someone went to press others helped him. When somebody lost the ball, we didn't turn our backs.",
      "\"One of my goals is I want to be in the right place at the right moment.",
      "\"Three days ago my wife gave birth to my son so I scored the goal for him.",
      "\"For us and a new manager it's so important to get three points.\""

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",

      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League - which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams - is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "A run to the semi-finals earned Arsenal roughly £70m in prize money. For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer.",
      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",
      "Both clubs are in need of a reset. Another rebuild. A season of consolidation.",
      "Not having a Champions League campaign - and at least eight league-phase matches to negotiate - wouldn't be a bad thing.",
      "If Amorim and whoever oversees Spurs want to keep their jobs next season, the bread and butter of the Premier League will dictate matters in that regard.",
      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",
      "Could those losers actually be the real winners?"

      "Report as two goals from Mason Mount saw Man Utd come from a goal down on the night to beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final at Old Trafford; United will play Tottenham in Bilbao",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 06:09, UK",
      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",
      "The result sets up an all-English final in Bilbao on May 21 following Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final. A difficult season for both Premier League clubs will end with one of them securing a Champions League spot next season.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (5), Lindelof (5), Maguire (5), Yoro (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (8), Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Garnacho (5), Fernandes (7), Hojlund (6).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (9), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Amass (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nAthletic Club: Agirrezabala (5), Gorosabel (6), Yeray Alvarez (6), Unai Nunez (6), Berechiche (6), Ruiz De Galarreta (6), Jaureguizar (7), Alvaro Djalo (6), Gomez (7), Berenguer (7), Sannadi (6).\n\n\nSubs:De Marcos (5), Prados (n/a), Olabarrieta (5), Guruzeta (5), Vesga Arruti (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Mason Mount.",
      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable. For me personally, my first goals at Old Trafford. Special night, one I have been waiting a long time for. We want to go to Bilbao and finish strong now.\"",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",

      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",

      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
