      "Manchester United's staff will be looking on enviously at matters at Paris Saint-Germain after the French giants invited all of their employees to the Champions League final. PSG will face Inter Milan at the showpiece event in Munich at the end of the month.",
      "This is the second time in five years PSG have reached the final, though they are bidding to win the competition for the first time. Their sole European title came back in 1996 with the Cup Winners' Cup.",
      "But they are now the favourites to finally break their Champions League hoodoo under the management of the impressive Luis Enrique. With his club on the verge of history, president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has decided to reward PSG's staff for their hard work.",
      "The Qatari's gift comes in the form of an invitation to travel to the Allianz Arena. The tickets will come out of the 18,000 allocation given to the French giants by UEFA for the huge game in Germany.",
      "Al-Khelaifi announced the news in a club-wide email sent on Friday morning. Each employee will be informed of the practical arrangements shortly, with PSG keen to show their appreciation.",
      "According to RMC Sport, in his email Al-Khelaifi emphasised the club's collective success, \"from the players on the pitch, to our technical staff, including all the teams in each department of PSG,\" to explain his approach.",
      "Al-Khelaifi's gift stands in sharp contrast to United's approach for last year's FA Cup final. The Red Devils faced Manchester City at Wembley, with staff forced to pay for return travel, as well as accomodation and food out of their own pocket.",
      "That was a cost-cutting move from controlling co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and it remains to be seen how the club will approach staff tickets for the Europa League final. Al-Khelaifi is seeking to create a more wholesome atmosphere at the Parc des Princes.",
      "After the semi-final win over Arsenal, he said: \"If you had told me, three games before the end of the group stage, when we might not have qualified for the play-offs, that we would get there... But I have always had confidence in my players, in my coach, the staff.",
      "\"I felt that there was something special this season, on the pitch, off it, everyone fighting for each other, everyone happy and proud to fight on the jersey. The supporters were magnificent again.\"",
      "Boss Enrique is desperate to finally bring the Champions League trophy to the French capital. He said on Friday: \"This will be the first Champions League final with the fans. Without them, it's not really a final. If a team deserves to win, after waiting so long, it's PSG.",
      "\"I know the club was founded the year I was born. Let's hope this connection proves true and we can secure the Champions League. We'll try to be the first. The problem is that there will definitely be one team that won't succeed with Inter Milan, but I hope we win.",
      "\"When the festive moments arrive, there's nothing more beautiful than giving our work to others. We'll try to finish with the cherry on the cake. The team and the fans deserve it. We deserve this chance to play in this final, just like last year.\""

      "\" Manchester United have an uncanny knack, even in difficult times and bad times - and this has been a really bad season - of picking up trophies. That is not a bad habit to have as a football club. They still get to finals and do things even though the league form has been awful - and it has been a terrible season.\"",
      "Boss Amorim was delighted to see United see off Bilbao, but admitted it will mean nothing if they do not beat Spurs. He said: \"I'm stressed already because of the final, because if you don't win it, in the end, it's nothing. So, we are happy to be there. Let's see.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a really good game. A little bit emotional because both teams are struggling a lot in the Premier League and want to win something. Two teams who play in the same league and know each other.",
      "\"It means a lot, not just to us but also for Tottenham. It means a lot, not just for me but also for Ange [Postecoglou], after this season. It's a massive game and I know it's going to be tough for the people in Bilbao because they wanted to play in the final at home.",
      "\"For all of our squad, it's really important to give something to our fans this season. First of all, if you in the odds, it's hard for a club to lose four times in a row, so we can’t think in that way. I think we have to have a full squad, that is really important.",
      "\"In the moments, I'm just worried about the next game, to try to manage everything, not to get injuries for the final. But again, we need to win it. If we don't win it, it's nothing, it means nothing for us, so let's see.\""

      "They'll face Premier League rivals Tottenham, a team which they've already lost to three times this season, in a two-fold final. Victory would not only mean that United have won a trophy in each of the last three years while marking Amorim's first taste silverware at Old Trafford, it'd see them qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of the club's hierarchy are desperate to see United back among Europe's elite not just for the prestige but the financial rewarded. The near-£100million boost would allow the Red Devils to splash more cash in the summer transfer window, although not everyone on their list of targets will require fee.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have the funds to sign Liam Delap this summer but any potential deal is expected to take some time. Delap, 22, is United's top target for a new striker in the window but the Red Devils could face competition from Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "The England under-21 international is understood to have a £30million release clause in his Ipswich contract which became active following the Tractor Boys' relegation from the Premier League. The Athletic report that United have enough cash at their disposal to sign Delap but are waiting on his decision.",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah on a free transfer. Germany international Tah has confirmed that he'll become a free agent when his contract at Leverkusen expires on July 1.",
      "Reports from Germany say that United are 'serious competitors' for the 29-year-old, with the Red Devils on the lookout for a new centre-back. Tah has also been linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, who tried to sign him last summer.",
      "Barcelona will listen to offers for vice-captain Ronald Araujo after his Champions League woes. Araujo, 26, apologised to fans on social media after being blamed for two of Inter Milan's goals during their agonising semi-final defeat on Tuesday.",

Casemiro, 33, scored to put United in the lead as they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in their semi-final second leg on Thursday.",
      "Now the Red Devils have the chance to win the competition and in turn qualify for next season's Champions League. Playing in Europe's elite competition would earn the club between £80million and £100m - but it would also cost them.",
      "Casemiro's salary has been at the centre of speculation over his future, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe keen to lower the wage budget at Old Trafford and reportedly identifying the Brazilian as the kind of big-money signing that United shouldn't have made. But Amorim's opinion could weigh heavily, as the Red Devils boss appears to love working with Casemiro.",
      "Having scored the goal which put United 2-1 up against Bilbao, the former Real Madrid stalwart was immediately substituted and Amorim gave him a big hug to congratulate his performance, prompting a huge cheer from the crowd. Casemiro also bagged a goal in the first leg and was decisive with two assists at home to Lyon during United's dramatic quarter-final win last month.",
      "The Brazil international has gone from a much-maligned figure during Erik ten Hag's final months in charge to a key player for Amorim. The pair didn't click instantly, though, as Casemiro only started one of the Red Devils' 14 games between mid-December and the start of February, playing a possible 136 minutes out of a potential 1,290 minutes.",

      "But he chose the perfect night to step up when Bilbao were threatening to become the first team in 134 ties to overturn a three-goal deficit from the first leg away from home. And for United to score seven goals across two legs against a side with the best defensive record in La Liga speaks volumes.",
      "Tottenham showed good character and sound game management to negotiate cold weather in the Arctic circle and Bodo/Glimt’s artificial pitch, and it should be a cracking final.",
      "Are United and Spurs the two worst teams, in terms of their domestic league positions, to contest a major European final? That’s debatable, although Aston Villa won the European Cup 43 years ago in a season where they finished 11th in the old First Division, so it’s not unprecedented for an English club to strike glory in Europe while going nowhere in the league at home.",

      "In recent years, Manchester United have had their fair share of transfer mishaps - and letting Scott McTominay is leave is looking like one of the worst. Since joining Napoli last summer, the Scotland international has lit up the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium with his energy, grit and goals, becoming a driving force behind the club's Serie A title push.",
      "Despite being one of United's more consistent performers during a turbulent period, McTominay was never truly celebrated at Old Trafford. That isn't the case in Naples, where the fans have rallied around him, nicknaming him 'McFratm' - a blend of his surname and the local word 'fratm', meaning 'bro'.",
      "Another moniker he's earned, 'The Bottle Opener', speaks to his knack for delivering breakthrough goals when they're most needed. But it isn't just his popularity that's surged - his market value has too.",
      "Napoli snapped him up for £25million, but his estimated value now sits at €40m (£34m), according to Transfermarkt. This rise is especially striking given his age of 28, and that his highest valuation at United topped out at £29m - offering yet another indicator of the club's inability to recognise what they had.",
      "Italian football icon Massimo Ambrosini has credited Napoli boss Antonio Conte with unlocking McTominay's full potential. \"His value has only gone up since he left Manchester United and the reason for that is Antonio Conte,\" he told JeffBet.",
      "\"Conte has created a team that gets the best out of his players and McTominay is perfect in the middle behind Romelu Lukaku. His value has definitely increased this season and I think that is down to the manager.\"",
      "With 12 goals in 33 matches - including 11 in the league - McTominay has been a major influence on Napoli's campaign. Holding a three-point lead atop the table, they're in a strong position to finish the season as champions if they maintain composure in their final trio of games.",
      "McTominay has delivered time and again with his performances and particularly with his goals, whether breaking the deadlock, equalising, or sealing victories. \"Scott is a complete player,\" Conte said back in September. \"He's versatile, who can be a trequartista behind the striker, he can be a mezzala in a three-man midfield, play in a two-man midfield or even wide in a 5-4-1 with licence to attack.\"",
      "More recently, Conte claimed that United consistently deployed McTominay poorly, failing to recognise what his true qualities were. \"He never had a main role at United that instead we have given him here,\" the coach said. \"He has grown a lot by working. Today he is [a] complete [player].\"",
      "Should Napoli finish the season as champions, it would mark only their second title since the Maradona era and just the fourth in their history. Their emotional 2022/23 triumph, led by superstar attackers Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, ended a more than 30-year wait.",
      "With both players having moved on, winning again this season would be a stunning feat. And with McTominay emerging as a new leader, Napoli may have found the next piece in their legacy-building puzzle - proof that great players don't always come with great fanfare."

      "Micky van de Ven insists Tottenham have \"nothing to fear\" against Manchester United in the Europa League final. The imperious Dutchman, who marshalled the Spurs defence to a second successive European away clean sheet in Norway against Bodo/Glimt, said of Ruben Amorim's side: \"They played Athletic Club, a really good team and it was 7-1 over the two games. \"So they've also shown some real quality in Europe. We knew it's going to be a different game, everything can happen in a final but we're not going there with fear, of course. \"We know our qualities, we know it's going to be a difficult game as Man United have also shown their quality in this European campaign.\"",
      "Tottenham are bidding to end their 17-year wait for silverware, however, it's also been 41 years since they last lifted a European trophy (UEFA Cup). Van de Ven is confident Ange Postecoglou's troops can now finally end that hoodoo by finishing a difficult season on the greatest of highs. He continued: \"Everybody goes to Bilbao to win a trophy. It has been a tough season and it will only be successful if we win the Europa League and get that trophy. \"To be in a European final with Tottenham is a big thing for the fans, the club and me personally, I'm really proud to be part of it. Van de Ven, who only played 135 minutes of Spurs' group campaign due to a hamstring injury, starred alongside influential captain Cristian Romero in Thursday's gritty victory inside the Arctic Circle. He paid tribute to the indispensable Argentine, hailing a captain's performance in the absence of injured skipper Heung-min Son.",
      "The 24-year-old said: \"Cuti's an unbelievable player. You can see that mentality wise. With the ball, without the ball, he knows how it is to play these types of games. \"You can see it in how he is, he shows so much to the rest, he helps the whole team. My partnership with Cuti we feel each other, he knows what to do, I know what to do, we back each other.\" Dominic Solanke, who netted in both legs of the semi-final, has warned his team-mates they cannot get trapped into thinking they have United's number - just because they've beaten them three times already this season. When asked if those victories can give Spurs confidence, he said: “Yeah, a little bit, but obviously it’s going to be a completely different game, different circumstances. “Finals are never easy. We’re both in the final for a reason, we’ve both done well in Europe, so we know it’s going to be a difficult game. Pressure is a privilege, when you’re at big clubs, you always want to be fighting for silverware\""

      "But in the form of a £52million fee and a five-year deal that started at £150,000 for an 18-year-old defender, they tabled big money. A pre-season injury was part of an unfortunate start to Yoro’s United career and he was hardly convincing in his early games for Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there are signs that Yoro, now 19, might just represent a rarity … an INEOS masterstroke. In his recent performances, he has been consistently good and was outstanding in the 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "From the time he was repeatedly skinned by Southampton’s Kamaldeen Sulemana back in January, it was clear that Yoro’s defensive approach is not based on raw speed. Instead, he is proving to be a fine reader of a game, astute with his interventions and an intelligent distributor of the ball.",
      "Remember any United centre-halves with that skill set? Yes - and it is no surprise Yoro has been picking his brains.",
      "“I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio (Ferdinand) and not always in front of the cameras,” says Yoro. “Sometimes, they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, then you need to take it.”",
      "And as the comparisons to Ferdinand began to be taken a touch more seriously, it is clear to see they are giving the young French defender a lift. He goes on: “Of course I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies.",
      "\"So, when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, (Nemanja) Vidic and (Raphael) Varane, you want to achieve the same things as them, you want to stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender. When they compare me to them it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this.”",
      "An odd report from Spain last week suggested his camp were exploring the possibility of getting him to Real Madrid after United's disappointing Premier League campaign. But Yoro looks like a player who is beginning to revel in the challenge facing United players of this era.",
      "He says: “It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned but now I’m 100 percent, I am starting to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season. I feel confident.”",
      "And looking ahead to the Europa League final against Spurs, Yoro is, of course, determined to start his United medal collection, declaring: “This is a club of trophies. When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this. We are Manchester United and we need to win trophies.”"

      "Ruben Amorim has told Manchester United's big players they will not be rested completely ahead of their Europa League final showdown with Tottenham. Although Amorim will rotate his squad for Sunday's visit of West Ham to Old Trafford, the United boss said he needs his big players to be sharp for the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes, defenders Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui, midfielder Casemiro and winger Alejandro Garnacho will all be taken out of Sunday's starting line-up. But they will all feature before the final against Spurs, because Amorim acknowledged they cannot afford to go into such a huge game cold, without match sharpness and rhythm.",
      "“No, they will play, because sometimes it's better to play,” said Amorim. “What I will protect is those players who can get an injury. The last game before Tottenham, away to Chelsea, was moved to Friday, so we will have time to recover.",
      "“Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury, but Harry has, so we will have to manage that. But they have to play and it's better to play than to stay out.”",
      "United's 4-1 semi-final second-leg win over Athletic Bilbao, which secured a 7-1 aggregate win, saw several players make a timely return to form after lengthy spells out injured.",
      "Mason Mount, who came off the bench to score twice, Amad and Luke Shaw all continued their comebacks from injury and are all likely to start tomorrow and compete to start in the final.",
      "“With some players, we have some doubts that they will recover, but they will push forward a little bit,” said Amorim. \"We have to manage that, not to take risks and then to have big issues. Of course, they will fight for a place in the final. They will be ready, excited.",
      "“That's a good thing, not just for the final, but also to prepare for the games of the Premier League, with something in our minds that we can win. It's going to be massive.",
      "“I think it's a good thing for the players that we will not have a lot of training sessions. They will fight for their places in the final in these next two games. Against Brentford, we made some mistakes and I felt that some of our players were thinking about this game [against Bilbao].”",
      "United have three Premier League games left this season and while Amorim said he must rest some key players, he acknowledged the need to select a team capable of winning in the league.",
      "“We have to acknowledge that we are Manchester United,” said Amorim. “We need to win games also in the Premier League. We have to use every game to improve, even to prepare for the final, but especially to prepare for the future.",
      "“Of course, I will try to manage everything. They don't need a lot of load now, so the trainings are going to be soft in that department. But of course they will push each other.”"

      "A former hooligan recalled risking his life on a brutal away day where he claimed ambushing fans were armed with bricks and Stanley knives. Tony O’Neill was once regarded as Britain’s most notorious football hooligan. Back in the 1970s, he became a key figure in two Manchester United firms, Red Army and later the Casuals, and hewas known as ‘the general’.",
      "But on April 23, 1974, he travelled to Merseyside when he was just 15 to watch a soon to be relegated United take on Everton at Goodison Park. And speaking on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series, he spoke about the chaos that unfolded.",
      "His mum initially forbade him from going but eventually he joined up with The Red Army who made their way to Liverpool.",
      "He said people had been speaking about the game for weeks. Tony remembered: “We knew what we was up against. This was going to be war. And I mean war. We were going to take on the scousers.”",
      "He said hundreds of United fans packed the trains before arriving at Lime Street Station where trouble immediately broke out. Tony said the group stood their ground before being welcomed by bricks once they started to make their way to the football stadium.",
      "“Bricks came flying over at us while we were on the march,” he said. “What a solid march, but a frightening walk if you were on your own or in small groups. But not this gang, this gang was massive and it was solid. There was no moving it.”",
      "He said this was a victory for the firm but the real violence took place after the match where Everton came out 1-0 winners in what was a night game.",
      "“I was depressed because I knew we were going down,” Tony recalled. “But we knew what we had to do. The gates open and we have got to be at the front. We knew the rules going there. This has always been the motto, go out there and whatever happens, happens. Take it to them. Don’t go hiding, don’t be sneaking off, especially in Merseyside.”",
      "Fights broke out outside Goodison Park but disputes between United fans took place where some wanted to get on coaches back to Lime Street and others wanted to march back.",
      "Tony was one of the ones who walked and he said it was “absolutely stupid” and the \"daftest thing you can do in the dark at Merseyside”. “You are going taking your life in your hands,” he added.",
      "Despite knowing he was going to get ambushed, Tony and the now smaller mob reached the end of Stanley Park, and that’s when the real danger commenced.",
      "“That was the nightmare of all nightmares,” he recalled. “They all were Liverpool fans. They just come screaming down the side street, straight into us.",
      "“Oh my God, I just bottled it. What is going on here? This is a nightmare. They had the street and they were running down it straight into us and people just bottled it straight away.",
      "“There is no disgrace in it whatsoever, you were outnumbered, in the dark, you were ambushed. And they caught us. I just legged it straight down.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t look behind me to see what is going on because this is now your life and you also know you are getting robbed, you are getting slashed, you are getting beat up, you are getting done in, there is no mercy here. They were out to get you and they were everywhere. I just kept running and didn’t look back. It is every man for himself.”",
      "Asked to elaborate on Stanley knives being present, he added: “Everyone was up for a fight, that’s what was happening up and down the country. But these took it to a different level and that was what you were fearful of.”",
      "Running for his life, Tony said bricks rained down on him, and at one point his shoe fell off, forcing him to kneel down while his two pals sprinted away.",
      "He described being “so relieved” to get back to Lime Station unharmed, calling it the longest run of his life. “I got away with my life, and I mean got away with my life,” he said.",
      "Speaking about the atmosphere on the train back, he said: “We were all made up. This is the blueprint of how we are going to go to Liverpool or Everton in the future. We knew we could take it to them - it just needed a little more organising.”",
      "Tony, now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black, then said within 18 months to two years, Manchester United became the main firm in the country. The former hardman now lives a very different life, and in 2017, he started working at Gary Neville’s and Ryan Giggs’ Hotel Football.",
      "He was handpicked by Neville to work security and speaking about his role, he once said: “I’ve stopped going to games. Me and my wife Debbie do the rooftop at Hotel Football on a match day.",
      "“The whole idea is to make it about the supporters’ clubs. The Hotel is a four-star, but the intention of the hotel was to be where the fans could mix.",
      "“The whole idea was to make it accessible, near Old Trafford, for the fans. I get the supporters clubs in. I get the right people in. People love to mix and see proper United fans.”"

      "talkSPORT pundit Simon Jordan has given his verdict and believes Neville and Beckham have been driven to action by the success of Wrexham, who will be playing Championship football next season after three straight promotions.",
      "“They've got a window of opportunity because they've seen what Wrexham have done,” he added. “They've seen the value of star power, and that value of star power has given revenues to Wrexham via Ryan Reynolds and the other fella. That's given them the resources to punch their way into the Championship.”",
      "Jordan went on to brand Neville a “pest” although he acknowledged the former England defender’s resourcefulness. He said: \"I find it very difficult to applaud Gary Neville on many things. I think he's a resourceful character.",
      "“If you've taken the task on, it's incumbent upon you - if you have a set of standards and you rate yourself, which most certainly he does - to produce an outcome that's meaningful.”",
      "Jordan added: “I don’t mind Neville, I just think he’s a bit of a pest. I think he has too much to say on other subjects that he’s not well-versed in, and he’s a hypocrite. But in the instance of Salford, it will be interesting… they’ve seen the Wrexham model. They should be saying, ‘Why can’t it be us?’”",
      "Beckham has also revealed that he wants to lead Salford to the Premier League. He told The Athletic: “We’re definitely not doing it for a laugh and it’s also not for the romantic side of things. Yes, we care about the club but we’re doing it to win.",
      "“We want Salford to be successful and we have had success, but then we want it to go on to the next level. I always dream big so I’m always going to want us to get to the pinnacle of football and be in the Premier League. But there’s a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point.”"

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim made his admiration for Mason Mount clear back in November after signing his praises - with his belief in the midfielder justified after his heroic cameo against Athletic Bilbao. Mount scored a superb brace for United after coming on as a substitute to help put them in the Europa League final.",
      "United went on to clinch a 7-1 victory on aggregate and seal a showdown with Premier League rivals Tottenham later this month and Mount was crucial to their win.",
      "Amorim brought him on in the 62nd minute for Manuel Ugarte, first curling an excellent finish into the far corner before perfectly executing a lobbed finish from just past the half-way line after catching the keeper off his line.",
      "It was a redemption moment in a difficult season for Mount that has been dominated by injuries but Amorim showed how much faith he had in the former Chelsea player last year.",
      "After starting him in the 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt at the end of 2024, he said: \" Mason Mount … I have to tell you I love that kid. The first thing is he is working really hard. And then you have to understand the human also.",
      "\"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.",
      "“I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he’s trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he’s shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"",
      "Amorim spoke about Mount after the Athletic Bilbao win and couldn't hide his pride for the player after witnessing his remarkable comeback from a difficult injury setback.",
      "\"The quality that he has, like you said, it's perfect for that position. He can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal. I'm really happy for him.\"",
      "Mount's resurgence has seen him now score three goals in his last two games after also netting in the 4-3 defeat to Brentford last time out.",
      "He has been slowly building up his fitness after starting five game in total this season and now has 23 appearances in total this term, including 14 in the Premier League and eight in Europe."

      "Grealish remains City's most expensive player ever - forking out £100million to sign him from Aston Villa back in 2021. However he's been unable to consistently deliver and game time this term has been hard to come by.",
      "The Sun reports that Napoli see the England man as a marquee signing with Conte believing he could help make Napoli Champions League contenders as they close on another Serie A title.",
      "Those close to Grealish claim the player is open-minded to leaving Manchester and accepts that a move may be needed to reignite his career, which would also boost his chances of an England recall.",
      "Grealish’s preference is thought to be heading overseas rather than staying in the Premier League. Spurs and former club Villa have been previously linked with swoop but City themselves are reluctant to let their player join a rival, fearful of him getting back to top form.",
      "Napoli have shown themselves to be an excellent stage for British players to reignite their careers and produce top form. The Naples outfit have benefitted massively from signing Scott McTominay, who wasn't wanted by Manchester United, only to excel in Italy.",
      "The Scot has been a huge hit, coming up with several big goals. His 12 strikes this term are already his best ever return in a single season and he could well be a league champion in a couple of weeks - something he never came close to achieving whilst in Manchester.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said recently: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Antony broke down in tears after clinching a place in the Conference League final with Real Betis. The winger opened up about the “very tough times” he faced at Old Trafford after his heroic performance on Thursday night.",
      "Antony played a starring role as Betis beat Fiorentina to reach their first ever European final. The Brazilian, 25, scored a phenomenal free-kick past his former Red Devils team-mate David de Gea in goal, curling it in off the post from distance.",
      "It marked his third game in a row on the scoresheet, having fired in a stunning volley from the edge of the box in the first leg to give his side a 2-1 lead heading to Florence. And with the tie hanging in the balance at 3-3 on aggregate, he proved the hero of the tie once more by setting up Abde Ezzalzouli with a squared pass for an extra-time winner.",
      "His team-mates rushed to celebrate with him as jubilant scenes broke out in the away end of the Stadio Artemio Franchi. And Antony couldn’t hide his emotions, bursting into tears on the pitch and in his post-match interview.",
      "The £86million winger said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here. I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "Antony was talking about his extremely difficult two-and-a-half years in Manchester, having been bought for an eye-watering sum in the summer of 2022 which put pressure on him from the outset. He was reunited with his former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag at United but failed to deliver for the English giants under the Dutchman and successor Ruben Amorim, resulting in him being brutally mocked and criticised throughout his Red Devils spell.",
      "Antony finally secured a loan exit from his United nightmare in January and has stunned the footballing world by appearing a completely different player in Seville. The Brazil international has eight goals and five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell.",
      "He has now etched his name into Betis folklore by playing a key role in their advancement to the Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea in Wroclaw, Poland, on Wednesday, May 28.",
      "Antony previously noted one reason for his upturn in form, saying: “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself. I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.",
      "“It [Seville] reminds me a lot of Brazil: the sun, the food, everything. The people are also very warm and happy; that's important for us who come from Brazil and are used to that. As I've said, I'm very happy.",
      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy. Seeing my family smiling is also essential for me; I always talk to my family in Brazil and they are also very happy for me.”"

      "With only two Premier League games and less than two weeks before the Europa League final, Ruben Amorim has little time to settle on his Manchester United starting XI.",
      "Injury-permitting, arguably nine selections seem certain: Andre Onana, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Amad's impact before and after an ankle injury that sidelined him for two-and-a-half months suggests he will make the cut but Amorim has a delicate balancing act to juggle. He picked eight defensive players in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao and named an unchanged team on Thursday evening.",
      "These are the key selection dilemmas the United head coach has:",
      "Nobody has played more games for United this season than Alejandro Garnacho (55) and the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao was his 14th successive start. However, his place has come under threat with the return of Amad and the number seven shirt not weighing as heavily on Mason Mount.",
      "Amad has to start the final and has come on to play on the right wing and as the No.10 over the past week. The 22-year-old can adapt to either role effectively and it is more a question of where, rather than if, he will start in Bilbao.",
      "Mount has started in a Champions League and European Championship final (albeit during the fake football of the Covid-19 pandemic) and he has the momentum. Yet he last completed 90 minutes in November 2023.",
      "Leny Yoro has had his best spell for United since the March internationals and Harry Maguire, yet to start a final for the club, is a shoo-in in the back three. The identity of the third could be uncertain until as late as next week.",
      "Victor Lindelof was unconvincing in both legs against Athletic Bilbao and these are his final weeks as a United player. Matthijs de Ligt has one match at Chelsea next Friday to prove his fitness and that could be too late in the day come the final. De Ligt has started only twice in the last six weeks.",
      "Ayden Heaven did individual work at Carrington in midweek but is very much an outside bet, having started only four career games and played 90 minutes once. Luke Shaw is an option but he struggled as a starter at Bournemouth and Brentford and the intensity in the final is bound to be more Premier League than Europa League.",
      "Only four United players have played in at least 50 games this season and Noussair Mazraoui is one of them. He seems assured of a start against Spurs, though Amorim said the Moroccan is currently lacking energy. A conservative role in the back three may be the best use of Mazraoui on May 21.",
      "Amorim is hopeful Diogo Dalot can be available for the final but, like De Ligt, he will have one game at Chelsea to prove his fitness. People at the club have spoken optimistically that Dalot will recover from a calf injury to play again this season and he was at Old Trafford for the Athletic tie.",
      "Amad is a credible alternative and would provide a better balance between defence and attack, otherwise Amorim could overload the starting XI with defensive players again. That sent out the wrong message against Athletic at Old Trafford and United only took them to the cleaners after attack-minded substitutions.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is a non-starter as he will be on the left. Mazraoui's workload could convince Amorim that he is better served in defence.",
      "Denzel Dumfries' excursions against Barcelona in Inter Milan's Champions League semi-final epics are a reminder of the endurance required of a winger in a back-three formation, so Amad or Dalot are the forward-thinking options."

      "It has been easy to pick apart Manchester United's recruitment mistakes in recent years, but occasionally, they get things right. As Ruben Amorim plots his Old Trafford rebuild, he has at least a couple of players who can signpost a brighter future.",
      "Despite their success in the Europa League this season, United's route back to the top is not easy. Their base camp is 15th after a desperate domestic season. Yet there are signs of promise and hope for years to come.",
      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "After failing to start any of Manchester United's opening 22 Premier League games this season, it was clear Antony had to be offloaded before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Following several months worth of speculation surrounding his future, the Brazilian international was given an escape route with just over a week of the window remaining, joining Real Betis.",
      "He joined the Spanish outfit on a loan deal until the end of the season, offering him the opportunity to get his career back on track after failing to make his mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Exactly 15 weeks since the deal was completed, Antony has grasped the opportunity with both hands and made the most of it.",
      "His first 21 appearances for Betis have seen him score eight goals and register five assists, meaning his tally of 13 direct goal contributions is only four fewer than what he has produced in 96 appearances for United.",
      "His latest strike in green and white saw him score past former United teammate David de Gea for the second time in a week, with his excellent free-kick on Thursday night helping Betis draw 2-2 with Fiorentina in the second leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final.",
      "After uncharacteristically scoring with his right foot in the first leg, his efforts helped Betis seal a 4-3 aggregate victory. It means they will now face Chelsea in the final at the end of May.",
      "As well as scoring Betis' opener in Italy, he also produced the assist for Abde Ezzalzouli's extra-time equaliser that ultimately sealed the tie in Betis' favour.",
      "Crying during both the full-time celebrations and a post-match interview, Antony said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here.",
      "\"I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "The aim of Antony's temporary switch to the Seville-based club was to try and develop a situation that would benefit both him and United. The former Ajax man, who joined the Reds in September 2022 for £86.3million, needed to get out of Old Trafford to get regular minutes under his belt and find the true version of himself.",
      "Scoring seven goals and registering five assists in 21 games, the winger has created a market for himself ahead of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Betis bosses have waxed lyrical about the winger throughout his time at the club and chief executive Ramon Alarcon confirmed in midweek they would like to extend his stay at the club by a further year, but conceded United will hold all the cards on any decision that is made.",
      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they've seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.\"",
      "Signed for £86.3m less than three years ago, it goes without saying that United paid over the odds, meaning they have no chance of recouping a fee anywhere close to what they paid.",
      "United, under profit and sustainability rules [PSR], will have to bank £32.52m to avoid a loss on him. His current form has created a market for him, meaning his stock is much higher than it was in January, but the aforementioned price tag could still put prospective suitors off.",
      "Another loan exit, this time for a full season, could be United's best chance of offloading Antony again this summer. A season-long loan deal with an option to turn it into a permanent deal at the end of it feels as though that could be the most likely type of deal to be struck.",
      "Whatever happens in the summer, Antony deserves credit for making his mark at Betis in the way he has. La Liga is not as physical as the Premier League and his performances have been much more satisfying to watch.",
      "United will have to hold their hands up and accept they misjudged Erik ten Hag's recommendation to bring him to Old Trafford, but they know they have a £32.5m target to keep in mind."

      "United have managed only one victory against a side not bound for the Championship next season (at Fulham in January) since their dramatic derby comeback success at the Etihad in December.",

      "The Reds reached the FA Youth Cup semi-finals, faced Manchester City in the last four of the Premier League 2 play-offs on Friday night, and have produced several first team players this term.",
      "Three have risen to prominence in recent weeks. Chido Obi has been the headline act in the academy this term such has been the interest in the former Arsenal forward since his summer arrival and the sheer volume of goals he has plundered.",
      "He was handed his first Premier League start at Brentford and it was the latest example of just how raw the 17-year-old is. Obi had one half chance against the Bees but he failed to connect with his header, while he fashioned a shot for himself late on which was blocked.",
      "\"Chido fought all game but you can feel he’s really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body. He’s going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these kind of games, this is the best way,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Obi has been joined in the XI by defensive duo Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass in recent weeks. The former performed well on debut against Wolves and started well at Brentford before being replaced.",
      "The 20-year-old had made matchday squads in the past but his ascension into the XI offers a chance to stake a claim to be part of United's future in a defence that will be somewhat reshaped in the summer when Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans depart while Lisandro Martinez is sidelined with a long-term injury and Luke Shaw has had fitness issues aplenty in recent seasons.",
      "Amass will be another with an eye on a more regular role come August. He will be part of the summer tour to the States, just as he was 12 months ago after which he was seemingly all set to make the step up to the senior squad.",
      "The 18-year-old was one of the standout performers in the States and showed his capabilities against Wolves even if he then struggled to contain Bryan Mbeumo in the defeat at Brentford.",
      "Amass was a surprise omission for the Community Shield last August and ultimately had to wait until last month for a debut. He's made further appearances since and will have an eye on competing with Patrick Dorgu for the left wing-back spot in Amorim's squad next term.",
      "\"I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands,\" Amass said last July. \"It could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "He, along with Obi and Fredricson, will hope to prove that point in the coming weeks."

Still, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Bayern Munich had an agreement in the pipeline last summer, and now he’s set to become a free agent. It would be easier to bring him in now, and Bayern have made it clear that they need a new centre-back with Eric Dier set to join Monaco this summer. So Bayern Munich will look to try and get him.",

      "The year is 2015 and it has been assumed that Cristiano Ronaldo was entering his golden years at Real Madrid. While his brilliance was being admired, he listed five players that he felt would take up the mantel from himself and Lionel Messi.",
      "Fast forward to the present, and the ex-Manchester United talisman, now 40, continues to find the net for Saudi club Al-Nassr. As his contemporaries have either hung up their boots or moved into management, Ronaldo has set his sights on an unprecedented sixth World Cup appearance with Portugal in the 2026 tournament to be held across the USA, Canada, and Mexico.",
      "Martin Odegaard made headlines as a promising 16-year-old making his move to Real Madrid from Norwegian club Stromsgodset. A fresh face with unmistakable skill, though still developing physically, Odegaard showed spurts of brilliance at Los Blancos.",
      "Ronaldo, recognising his potential early on, said: \"He has a good future ahead. We must give him time to learn, to take his best decisions. But I see a lot of potential in the player, he has got a good left foot.\"",
      "Fast forward to today, and Odegaard has found his footing at Arsenal, playing a crucial role in the Gunners' last three Premier League title pursuits. Under Mikel Arteta's guidance, he has become one of Europe's top midfielders and a regular starter for the team.",
      "The only thing missing from his Arsenal career is a major trophy, as he wasn't with the club when Arteta clinched the FA Cup in his debut season.",
      "In 2015, Eden Hazard had just wrapped up his third season with Chelsea, having won the Premier League title. At just 24 years old, he had already amassed an impressive array of trophies and seemed set to dominate the game for another decade.",
      "The Belgian maestro stayed with Chelsea until 2019, when he made a high-profile move to Real Madrid for a reported £100million. With Ronaldo's departure, Hazard was given the Portuguese superstar's iconic No. 7 shirt, seemingly as a direct replacement.",
      "Sadly for Hazard, injuries hampered his time at the Bernabeu, preventing him from displaying the skills and abilities he demonstrated at Chelsea. Despite contributing to two La Liga titles and a Champions League victory in Madrid, Hazard was let go in 2023 and announced his retirement at the relatively young age of 32.",

      "After bagging the Golden Boy award in 2013 and the Bravo Award in the following year, Paul Pogba was shaping up to be one of the world's top midfielders. The Frenchman was a key player for Juventus, where he clinched four Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias.",
      "Despite being on the losing side when Barcelona defeated the Italian giants 3-1, his performance in the 2015 Champions League final was noteworthy. Shortly after Ronaldo predicted Pogba would dominate world football, United shattered the world transfer record to bring him to Old Trafford in 2016.",
      "Following victories in the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season under Jose Mourinho, things took a turn for the worse for the Frenchman – and United. He returned to Juventus in 2022, but a string of injuries caused him to miss the 2022 World Cup.",
      "In February 2023, Pogba received a four-year suspension after a drugs test revealed elevated levels of testosterone in his system, but a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) saw it reduced to 18-months. He is currently a free agent seeking his next opportunity.",
      "When Memphis Depay joined United in 2014, many believed he was the successor to Ronaldo's throne. After a standout performance at the 2014 World Cup, Louis van Gaal, who had moved to United after leading the Netherlands to the semi-final in Brazil, signed Depay.",
      "After a mixed first season at United, Ronaldo named the Dutchman as one of five players he believed would dominate the game. Despite being given Ronaldo's iconic No. 7 shirt, he never came close to matching the brilliance of the Portuguese star.",
      "He left United for Lyon in 2017, before spending a year-and-a-half at Barcelona. Atletico Madrid signed him in the January transfer window but released him 18 months later.",
      "After a short stint as a free agent, Depay is now playing for Brazilian giants Corinthians, where he has scored 13 goals and provided 13 assists in 39 games.",
      "Neymar was one of the most exciting talents to ever come out of Brazil when he began making headlines with his performances for Santos as a young player. Shortly after an impressive tournament for Brazil at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Barcelona paid the Brazilians £49m to bring him to the Nou Camp.",
      "He went on to establish himself as one of the world's best players, leading Paris Saint-Germain to more than double the previous transfer record to sign him from the Catalans for £200m. Despite being reunited with Messi and joining the same frontline as the Argentine and Kylian Mbappe, things did not go well for Neymar in the French capital.",
      "The South American star was eventually sold to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, where he was plagued by injuries. After failing to recover in time, the Saudis de-registered him from the club to make room for Brazilian left-back Renan Lodi.",
      "In 2024, Neymar only managed to play 42 minutes of football for the Middle Eastern side but still pocketed a staggering £85.98m for his efforts. He returned to Santos, where his footballing journey began, and has even managed to regain his fitness and form, contributing three goals and three assists in nine appearances for the Brazilian club in 2025."

That job lasted a year before he was headhunted by Manchester United, but he remains a respected figure at City for his work in implementing many of the systems that the first team are currently benefitting from.",
      "His replacement, Thomas Krucken, was at the Academy Stadium as City look to add the Premier League 2 play-offs to their league winners trophy. An under-21 derby at the semi-final stage added more spice to a contest that would end one season and keep alive another.",

      "The Saudi Pro League's interest in Greenwood is purely speculation at the moment, but patterns from the Middle-East in relation to transfers often link to big money. Aston Villa sold 21-year-old John Duran for £64m, so if Marseille were able to sell Greenwood for anywhere near that price could see United earn north of £18m from their sell-on cut.",

A nostalgic flick back through history tells us that some of Manchester United's greatest ever players wore that particular shirt number with pride - yet more recent 'owners' of (arguably) the most famous shirt in world football haven't hit such heights.",
      "George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo (twice). Every United supporter will have their own favourite No.7 from years gone by and each of those stars etched their names into the club's history books, while Mason Mount might now be able to emerge from the shadows and underline his own credentials.",
      "Injuries, form and so forth have effected the former Chelsea man heavily since a big-money move to Old Trafford ahead of the 2023/2024 season. The now-sacked Erik ten Hag thought so highly of Mount that he added the No.7 shirt front and centre into his and the club's sales package to lure the midfielder in from Stamford Bridge.",
      "It worked. Mount left Chelsea for a staggering £65million, but has yet to repay that transfer fee.",
      "However, the fit-again 26-year-old might well have kick-started his Old Trafford career. He was sensational after a second-half introduction against Athletic Club in their Europa League semi-final showdown on Thursday night and United might well find it difficult not to give him more air-time in the showpiece.",
      "Mount doubled and then tripled his season's goal tally to send Bilbao packing. His second on the night had shades of the Beckham about it and while the comparisons end there - for now - Mount finally has his own springboard to lift the No.7 curse once and for all.",
      "Ronaldo - or CR7 to offer up his moniker - briefly did so in his second coming. However, since the Portugal captain left United for the first time in 2009 when Real Madrid came calling, there have been few glittering moments from United No.7s as we take a look at those who have tried - and failed - to join the more successful club;",
      "Not quite the player he was at Liverpool or Real Madrid before. Granted, he still won the Premier League title in 2011, but 17 goals in 52 outings was by no means his best return.",
      "A successful and popular player in his own right, Valencia spent 10 years at Old Trafford, book-ending his time as No.7 by wearing the No.25 shirt. It was in the latter he enjoyed better days for United, accumulating 400 matches and six major honours, including two Premier League titles and the Europa League in 2017.",
      "The less said about Di Maria at United, the better. A worthy No.7 elsewhere, but not in Manchester.",
      "Big things were expected when United splashed out for Depay, when Louis van Gaal was manager. He was highly-rated in the Netherlands and Europe at the time, but he was ultimately unable to cut the mustard, before going on to forge a successful career with Lyon, later representing Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.",
      "A similar story to Di Maria, unfortunately. Magic elsewhere, but not at United.",
      "In the twilight of his career, Cavani showed glimpses at Old Trafford and beyond, without doing quite enough to place his name alongside No.7 royalty. He graciously gave up the shirt to Ronaldo, when he arrived for his second spell at the club, before Cavani left in 2022 with 19 goals and 59 games to his name in United colours."

      "In the first leg of their Europa League semi-final last week, United showed they were not overwhelmed by the intimidating atmosphere inside the San Mames Stadium. From 30 minutes onwards, United dominated and while they were helped by their man advantage, they never looked in danger of letting their comfortable lead slip.",
      "This time, United shall benefit from a less hostile crowd with at least 14,500 supporters in the stadium cheering on Amorim's men. But it cannot be underestimated how important it is for professional footballers to be familiar with their surroundings before a game of this magnitude.",
      "Tottenham will head into the unknown in a couple of weeks' time while United should feel confident that they can replicate their game plan that served them so well against Athletic Club previously."

      "Man Utd‘s run in the Europa League has been their only saving grace as they will qualify for the Champions League if they beat Spurs in the final, but a huge squad overhaul is required with only four players ‘immune’ to this summer’s ‘fire sale’.",

      "‘Manchester United should be able to play in two or three competitions at once without sacrificing something, and they’ve clearly sacrificed the league,’ Scholes added.",
      "‘I don’t like it and I don’t agree with it and I believe there has to be some sort of standards required in a Premier League team. It’s almost as if they go into Premier League games and there’s an acceptance that they’re not going to win the game, which is madness. I think the acceptance has come from everyone.",

      "‘They’re probably thinking: ‘Play whoever you want, we don’t care’. There’s an acceptance to it which I think is wrong because the Premier League is your bread and butter. But if you’re going to get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, it’ll all be forgotten, I hope.",
      "‘There is that bad taste in your mouth that the Premier League form is so bad, and they might regret it next year. I think the manager should be using this time to learn how to win games when you’re not playing that well, because it’s going to happen again next year.",

      "I was a little underwhelmed with his signing, as it seemed to be ‘not quite’ what we needed at the time. Since then the poor guy has been through a really tough time. It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",
      "That is why it was really heartwarming to see him show what he can do yesterday. The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it. I suspect Amorim’s system may reveal exactly what kind of player he is, and that he may end up being a damn good one.\nAkillies, Malawi",

The shifting financials in football has meant being good doesn’t guarantee you anything anymore, but its usually more fun to be knocking around at the top table than not (despite the impression you get from the more delusional corners of fandom).",

PSG are in here, but really need to win something other than League 1.",
      "The third tier are clubs that were once powerful but time has moved on and they are now operating in small leagues, Ajax, Benfica and the like. A team that seeing their jersey makes you nostalgic but you know they will never be back at the top table. Forest and Villa may be dancing around the edges of this group for English football fans of a certain vintage, but they are more sparkling wine than champagne.",

This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",
      "The fifth tier is for your sexy teams, Napoli, Marseilles, Bilbao, Fiorentina. They won’t win much but it looks like fun. Tottenham may have a shiny stadium and Brentford may be well run but they just don’t cut it. Celtic probably reside here, not enough European success to be in the third tier.",

If you’re not an Arsenal fan and Arteta and Arsenal cause you this much rage and causes you to think up these strange analogies and reasons to hate them/him then I think you probably need to step back from the internet, football and re-assess yourself a bit.",

Then, and only then, he angrily hoofs the ball away, I suppose, because the ref had the temerity to blow up after Trossard so skillfully smashed another player over right in front of him. Your boy was dangerously out of control and fully deserved his exclusion. Using this as an example of referee bias massively undermines your case btw.",

Now, it’s not that deep. Ludicrously well-paid manager addresses incredibly excited team who’ve just gotten to a European final. Table stakes right?",

      "Man Utd’s rebuild under Ruben Amorim is gathering pace, but one former England international believes their problems go far beyond any one signing, no matter how talented.",
      "Chris Waddle has warned Man Utd must brace themselves for a long-term rebuild under Amorim and avoid falling back into short-term fixes as he attempts to repair an age",
      "“Manchester United have an ageing squad,” he said.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, who has a massive job on his hands, has brought a lot of young players through. They have to keep their hands off the panic button this summer. They need to give him time, and there are players there that he needs to move on.”",
      "Waddle also stressed that United’s biggest challenge this summer might not be who they bring in, but who they can afford to get off the books.",
      "“They need a big investment,” he continued.",
      "“Four or five players need to come in, but the even bigger challenge will be getting rid of some. They’re on massive wages. The clubs that will want them won’t have the financial muscle United do, and it’ll be tough to sell them on to Italy or Spain.”",
      "Amorim is expected to be backed in the transfer market this summer as Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe look to reshape the first team and staff structure behind the scenes. But patience, Waddle thinks, will be just as important as new signings.",
      "“They lost 4-3 to Brentford, but until Amorim gets his own team together, it’s too early to judge. I think the top six is still a massive challenge for United next season. They need two or three years with Amorim in charge. They have to stop changing managers.”",
      "Still, the club is moving early to secure what could be their first major incoming of the Amorim era – a dynamic, versatile forward who has been one of the standout attacking players outside the traditional top six this season.",
      "Sources close to the deal, such as transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, indicate United are in advanced talks with Wolves over a move for Matheus Cunha, with negotiations centring around a fee in excess of £50 million.",
      "Waddle, while full of praise for the Brazilian’s ability, was quick to temper the hype.",
      "“Cunha is a fantastic footballer. He can be temperamental, but perhaps United would be the making of him,” he said. “You can’t be mardy at a club like that — the fans will let you know.”",
      "Cunha, 25, has scored 15 Premier League goals this season for Wolves and is widely viewed as ready for a step up. Waddle believes the move could be transformative if the player embraces the pressure.",
      "“He probably thinks he’s at the stage when he should be at a club like United. Wolves are a big club, but Cunha will be looking for another level up.",
      "“He’s got a huge opportunity here. If he’s one of the players to turn United around and [get them] challenging again, he could be like Eric Cantona, the man who changed United.”",
      "It’s a lofty comparison, but one that hints at the scale of hope and expectation surrounding Amorim’s first major recruit.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Super agent Jorge Mendes could complicate Manchester United’s summer move for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha, according to reports.",
      "The amount of money it would take for Man Utd to buy Wolves forward Matheus Cunha “could be an issue” ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Paul Scholes has two concerns over the imminent Man Utd signing and claims nothing can save what has been a “disaster” of a season for the club.",
      "Even Matheus Cunha can’t flop at Manchester United… right? He is ridiculously good and Wolves have won six in a row. It’s F365’s 3pm Blackout…",
      "Ruben Amorim hinted that Man Utd are ready to move early in the transfer window, insisting players want to come as he addressed links to Matheus Cunha."

      "But a report from Spanish outlet Nacional suggests United are setting their sights far higher – just about as high as they can get in fact – as Red Devils bosses reportedly see PSG star Gianluigi Donnarumma as ‘a market opportunity and would be willing to present an offer close to €60m (£51m) to ensure his signing’.",
      "Donnarumma was the scourge of Arsenal in the Champions League, pulling off a number of magnificent saves across the two legs to set up a final meeting with Inter Milan at the end of this month.",
      "A move away seems unlikely, particularly to United, but the report claims his ‘continuity is in doubt’ as his contract expires in 2026.",

      "“We just have to sign the new contract. But it’s up to the club.”",
      "United are thought to be near the front of the queue to pounce on the 26-year-old if a new contract isn’t forthcoming.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘From Paris, for now, they remain silent about a possible exit, but the growing interest of the ‘red devils’ and other European clubs could accelerate events. If PSG fails to renew its star goalkeeper, the next summer market could be decisive for its future. Donnarumma, with an already consolidated career and room for growth, is facing a possible new challenge away from Ligue 1.’",
      "A former Premier League referee claims Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma deserves a “ban” for his “disgraceful” actions vs Arsenal.",
      "PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is a very brave man, reportedly deciding he is ‘open’ to joining AC Milan’s arch-rivals Inter.",

      "“My understanding is that the conversations remain absolutely ongoing between Man United and Matheus Cunha, between the player and the club over the terms of the contract,” Romano told CaughtOffside. “So, it remains ongoing, and Man United are also aware of the situation at Wolves – they know that the club want Cunha’s full release clause to be paid.",
      "“The clause is £62.5m, and I’m told that Man United would ideally like to reschedule the payment terms. This would be an important point of the conversation, in order to find also a way to make it work with Financial Fair Play. But Cunha remains an important target for Man United this summer, with talks and negotiations ongoing over the contract details.",
      "“So, let’s see how the next steps and stages of the story will go, but for sure United remain in active talks to sign Cunha for the summer transfer window.”"

      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",

      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",

      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",

      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper.

      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

Turns out he’s not indestructible.",
      "Bilbao were trying to overturn a 3-0 deficit against a side worth considerably more than them. To put it into context, they’ve only twice spent more on a player than United did just to sack Erik ten Hag and hire Amorim. There’s your pointless stat of the night.",
      "And yet, for all that disparity, any away side has a bit of hope at Old Trafford these days. Bilbao gave it a go. The issue? Finishing. Or lack of it.",

      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",

      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",

Manchester United could do worse than making it part of their negotiation pitch that incoming signings might be the one player who can fix them. Bruno Fernandes committing the best years of his career to a certified basket case proves it can work.",
      "Things have obviously changed since Robinho was caught off-guard by the revelation that there were two Premier League clubs based in Manchester, and United have been drowned out by many more teams than their noisy neighbours.",
      "But they can still genuinely compete with the best in the transfer market in spite of their own failings, and if more than a decade of general irrelevancy has done little to change that then nothing will.",
      "",
      "10) Borussia Dortmund\nThe established cliche used to be that Bayern would sign the best players from Dortmund, who in turn would shop in the smaller Bundesliga markets. But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th as often as they have 2nd in the last eight Bundesliga seasons, and are currently losing the fight to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, it ultimately tends to come down to money and Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "In 2014, Neville and fellow Class of ’92 members Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt bought non-league side Salford City as part of a consortium which included businessman Peter Lim.",
      "Neville and Co. oversaw a rapid rise as Salford City earned four promotions in five years to reach League Two, but the club has stagnated in recent seasons.",
      "Salford City have just finished their sixth-straight season in League Two and narrowly missed out on the play-offs, finishing eighth in the table.",
      "Wrexham have stolen their thunder in recent years as the League Two outfit have been mocked for their huge spend on transfers failing to pay off and the hierarchy rashly sacking managers.",
      "READ: Mikel Arteta mid-table in Premier League manager rankings topped by staggering Slot",
      "Now, Salford chiefs have recognised that changes are necessary, with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing Neville and Beckham are part of a ‘new consortium’ in control of the club.",
      "His report confirms Butt, Giggs, Neville and Scholes have ‘relinquished their stakes, but will continue to occupy various positions at Moor Lane’.",
      "It is noted that Neville and Beckham have been ‘seeking investment partners’ since Lim’s exit from Salford City in 2024 and they ‘plan on lifting the club to new heights’ amid their ‘commitment to injecting significant funds’.",

      "After ‘considering multi-club models and a direct owner’, Neville and Beckham ‘decided to join forces with Declan Kelly, founder of U.S.-based advisory firm Consello, and Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association’, who ‘will co-chair Salford’s board of directors’.",
      "Regarding Salford City’s Championship plans, the report adds:",
      "‘The collective are believed to have raised around $15-20million [approx £15m at most] to boost Salford’s sporting and infrastructural ambitions over the next five years. Inside that timeframe they are targeting promotion to the Championship.",
      "‘Each member will hold a 5 per cent or 10 per cent stake, totalling at 80 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent has been earmarked for additional partners.",
      "‘None of them will have day-to-day involvement — interviews are taking place to appoint a chief executive and that person will drive matters on the ground — but their influence is set to be felt across the operation.’",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",

      "Gary Neville labelled Tottenham midfielder Lucas Bergvall as “pathetic” during Spurs’ 5-1 defeat to newly-crowned Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho."

      "Manchester United have sent Torino into a ‘panic’ over goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic after Fabrizio Romano revealed ‘initial contacts’ have been held over his summer transfer.",
      "United are scouring the market for alternatives to Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir after a difficult season for the stoppers at Old Trafford.",
      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",
      "Europa League glory to end the infamous trophy drought and qualify for the Champions League, despite a potential club-record Premier League low finish, would be a successful season for Spurs.Declan Olley"

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",

      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",

      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",

      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",

      "Turn the music down.",
      "Stop singing about Eric Cantona and Ledley King.",
      "No one likes a party pooper but let's get real and pour some cold water on the Bilbao party for a moment. This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League - which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams - is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",
      "Both clubs are in need of a reset. Another rebuild. A season of consolidation.",
      "Not having a Champions League campaign - and at least eight league-phase matches to negotiate - wouldn't be a bad thing.",
      "If Amorim and whoever oversees Spurs want to keep their jobs next season, the bread and butter of the Premier League will dictate matters in that regard.",
      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",

      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",

      "Friday 9 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Aston Villa are a cracking bet to beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fulham have had a strange season.",
      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion.",
      "He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",
      "He's in the shop window too, isn't he? Strikers don't come more motivated when trying to play for a next contract so he's going to be doing his upmost to grab the limelight.",
      "\"Who cares if we've struggled in the league?\" beamed Ange Postecoglou after going to the Arctic Circle and getting the job done in impressive fashion on Thursday night. Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",
      "P+L = +8.97"

      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
