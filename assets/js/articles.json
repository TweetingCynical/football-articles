      "Manchester United face the daunting prospect of losing Bruno Fernandes this summer as Saudi Arabia interest ramps up. The Portuguese playmaker has continued to be the talisman at Old Trafford.",
      "He enjoyed one of his best years despite the Red Devils enduring a horror campaign. His exploits have seen Al-Hilal stand up and take note. They've tabled an offer - but want an answer within days to leave the player and the club little time.",
      "Having held extensive talks with Fernandes' representatives, the Daily Mail report that the Saudi Pro League side have given him a final 'take it or leave it' offer. He has 72 hours to reply, with the Saudi side prepared to quadruple his salary with a package worth £700,000 per week.",
      "If he agrees to move then Al-Hilal will submit an offer to United worth around £100million. That would represent a huge profit as the club look to rebuild.",
      "Ruben Amorim has previously claimed Fernandes is not going anywhere. He said: \"No, it's not going to happen. He's not going anywhere because I've already told him! I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He's 30, but he's still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he's there for 30 at least, so he's the type of player we want here and he's not going anywhere.\"",
      "According to ESPN the Red Devils are interested in the Crystal Palace ace, who has just been key to the club's FA Cup success. His performances at Selhurst Park have helped him earn England recognition, but the Eagles will fight hard to keep the winger and can also use the leverage of - unlike United - being in Europe. They lost Michael Olise 12 months ago and will be loathed to see another of their main men depart the club, but a mammoth fee could turn heads in south London.",
      "The Lyon man showed how good he can be against United themselves as the French side threatened to down Amorim's side in the Europa League. The 21-year-old has come through the ranks in Lyon and the way he made the Ligue 1 side tick will have raised eyebrows. He is understood to have a release clause in his contract of around £20-25m, which is huge value for a player of his quality with Premier League links continuing to ramp up.",
      "The Brentford ace is reportedly seen as a potential back-up to Eze. Mbeumo has just scored a career-best 20 goals in the Premier League and the Bees have shown they will sell their top players for the right fee.",
      "There's a huge profit to be made on the Frenchman, who signed for the club when they were in the Championship. Mbeumo is a different player to Fernandes, but would add a different dimension.",
      "The Nigerian wouldn't be a like for like replacement for Fernandes, but he would go a long way to replacing the goals he's scored. Osimhen is all but certain to leave Napoli this summer and United may be able to afford him should they cash in on their Portuguese playmaker. One thing Osimhen guarantees is goals - which has been a huge issue in Manchester.",

      "Antony's time in Manchester looked to be all but over, yet he's shown that he still has his magic and has become one of the standout players in La Liga since the turn of the year. He's scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, which has seen them finish sixth in La Liga and reach the Conference League final as they eye their first-ever European trophy. It is a stunning return to form for the player, who was ready to pack it all in before his 25th birthday.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",

Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on the £62.5million capture of Matheus Cunha as they waste no time in conducting their much-needed summer business. The Wolves star has enjoyed a stellar year and his release clause makes him easily attainable.",
      "An agreement has already been struck between the Brazilian and the Red Devils with the structure of the payments seemingly the last hurdle before he officially moves to Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha has been hugely influential at Molineux and helped keep Wolves in the top flight when they found themselves in a relegation scrap earlier this season. Ruben Amorim believes he will perfectly suit his philosophy with the team currently struggling in attack.",
      "The Wolves star impressed plenty of onlookers throughout the season with Liverpool boss Arne Slot confessing he was more than capable of playing for a top team in the Premier League.",
      "It looks as if the Manchester outfit will win the race for his signature as the first piece of their puzzle potentially falls into place. Amorim has made bolstering his frontline an early priority this summer as he looks to revive United's fortunes.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both struggled to be effective in the final third. Beyond Bruno Fernandes and Amad United were lacking any spark which has led them to pursue new faces in attack following their worst ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Once Cunha, as is expected, becomes a Red Devil the attention will turn to their next signing. Liam Delap is a name that has been banded about for several weeks. An impressive season with relegated Ipswich proved the young forward could cut it in the top flight.",
      "He has a release clause, valuing him at £30m, and United have been tipped to land the ex-Manchester City man. Their lack of Champions League football could cost them with Chelsea also keen - and they are playing on Europe's top table next season.",
      "Delap is a man who can lead the line, as opposed to Cunha who would play slightly deeper. If it is players like the Brazilian that Amorim wants to prioritise then Eberechi Eze could be the next man he pursues. Crystal Palace's FA Cup hero has seen his stock rise and rise in recent years.",
      "According to ESPN United are 'interested' in Eze, but the Eagles will fight hard to keep the winger and can also use the leverage of being in Europe to retain the Englishman. They lost Michael Olise 12 months ago and will be loathed to see another of their main men in attack depart the club.",
      "A second option in Manchester is going after Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees showed last summer with Ivan Toney that they will sell their top players for the right fee and Mbeumo was able to take centre stage for the west Londoners this term, scoring 20 times in the Premier League - which are career best figures.",
      "Amorim is tipped to pursue natural wing-backs who can play in his 3-4-3 system, but no names have yet been touted. Currently he's playing full-backs in those positions and Chelsea beat the Red Devils to the signing of Sporting Lisbon's Geovany Quenda. It remains to be seen whether a new goalkeeper is also pursued.",

      "Europe had proved to be a welcome respite for the manager and the players. They went unbeaten for 14 games en route to the final, but losing to Tottenham denied them the chance to make the Champions League and land the £100m of revenue it would've bought them.",
      "Their lowly league position means they won't play in Europe whatsoever, denying them even more revenue. The win over Aston Villa on the final day saw them ultimately end up in 15th and just exceed the 40-point mark.",
      "However due to finishing in the bottom half they landed just £16.9m in prize money. That is compared to the £40m they scooped for ending in eight last year under Erik ten Hag.",

The second thing I want to say is thank-you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, which I know was really bad.",

If there is one club in the word that can overcome any situation, any disaster it is our club, Manchester United. I also want to say thank-you to my players.

      "\"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best,\" Cunha told CNN Brasil via Daily Mail. \"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal,\" asked if they could do that together, he added: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help.\"",
      "Amorim is keen to bring in a new No.10 to play behind the striker in his 3-4-2-1 system. According to the BBC, the release clause in Cunha's contract is required to be paid in full after the 2026/27 season.",
      "United boss Amorim has warned that his club may struggle to complete deals this summer due to their financial situation. He said: \"We have a plan that is to bring [in] some new players.",
      "\"Our big plan is to improve the team we have and improve the academy as that is our future, as it was in past. It’s not going to change so much. We have financial fair play rules, so we are not allowed to do so much this summer.",

      "Ruben Amorim brutally made it clear to Alejandro Garnacho that his Manchester United career is over in front of his team-mates. Amorim has grown increasingly frustrated with the Argentine winger and has decided to move on from him this summer.",
      "Garnacho did reach double figures for goals and assists but it was a frustrating season for the 20-year-old, who found his game-time curbed by Amorim. He played just 19 minutes of the Europa League defeat to Tottenham and was left out of the squad entirely for the final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "The winger had been a key player in United's FA Cup win last year, scoring in the final against Manchester City. He still has another three years to run on his contract, but Amorim has all but confirmed he will not play again.",
      "Amorim has previously shown his frustration with Garnacho, when he dropped the Argentine for the victory at Manchester City on 15 December. That decision was put down to performances in training, with Garnacho later returning to the fold.",
      "But the embattled United boss has now made it clear that the winger no longer features in his plans. Amorim held an end of season meeting with his squad on Saturday at the club's Carrington training ground.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Amorim singled out Garnacho in front of his team-mates to effectively end his Old Trafford career. The United boss is said to have been so angry that he effectively told Garnacho to 'pray' he can find another club rather than have to return for pre-season training at the start of July.",
      "He is alleged to have said: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\" The tone of the comment left Garnacho and his team-mates in no doubt that the academy product's United career is over.",
      "Garnacho is understood to have upset Amorim by complaining about his game-time in the Europa League final defeat to Spurs. He said after the game: \"Obviously it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things.",
      "\"When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.’ Garnacho’s brother also accused Amorim of ‘throwing him under the bus.\"",
      "Although Garnacho has joined United’s post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong, the club are said to be concerned that Amorim’s stance may have devalued the winger. For his part, Amorim is refusing to comment on the discussions he has held with his players.",
      "\"He is a Manchester United player that is not in the squad today, but he continues to be a Manchester United player. I will speak with my players but the focus is the last game. I don't know what is going to happen but we have a plan,\" Amorim said after Garnacho was dropped for the win over Villa.",
      "\"We were prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea of the type of squad we want but we still have the last game. We have time to address all these situations.\""

The Magpies clinched fifth place on the final day of the Premier League season, narrowly securing their return to Europe's top club competition.",
      "For most of the final day of the campaign, it looked like they were going to have to settle for the Europa League, after falling 1-0 behind at home to Everton. However, when United took the lead against Villa through Amad Diallo in the 76th minute, the Magpies were lifted back into fifth position, despite trailing the Toffees.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went on to secure the three-points through Christian Eriksen, who dispatched a penalty in the 87th minute to double United's lead. Despite eventually succumbing to defeat to Everton, Newcastle players and supporters erupted into celebrations not seen since they won the League Cup at Wembley after it was confirmed that they would be back in Europe's top-tier competition next season.",
      "Despite being a vocal critic of the Red Devils in the past, particularly this season, Shearer has promised to keep his criticism of United to himself, to say thank you to his former rivals.",
      "While speaking on the Rest Is Football podcast, co-host Gary Lineker said: \"You had a very nervy afternoon, Alan.\" Shearer responded: \"I will never have a bad word said against Manchester United again,\" prompting laughter from both.",
      "Lineker quipped: \"Who would have thought that they'd bail you out?\" to which Shearer confessed: \"And a certain decision that might've helped.\"",
      "He was referencing the moment of controversy at Old Trafford, which saw a goal from Morgan Rogers disallowed, after he was deemed to have kicked the ball out of the hands of United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "Despite replay footage showing the Turkish shot-stopper had no control of the ball, VAR could not intervene to award the goal, as official Thomas Bramall had blown the whistle before the ball went into the net. The hugely controversial moment prevented Villa from taking a 1-0 lead, and, ultimately, stopped them from qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "However, it was a blessing for the Magpies, who will compete in Europe's elite competition for the second time in three years. It may also go some way to retaining star man Alexander Isak, who has been linked with moves to the likes of Arsenal and many others.",
      "Talking about the controversial result, Shearer, who had many battles against United during his career, said: \"Who would have thought it? Man United doing the Toon a massive favour.",
      "\"I mean they've been rotten all season, haven't they? They deserved to win yesterday. Villa were really poor and lacked so many things. They couldn't complain in terms of United deserving to win but they could complain against the decision that went against them.\"",
      "Directly after their season wrapped up, United boarded a flight to Malaysia for a post-season tour. Their itinerary includes a match in Kuala Lumpur on May 28 and another in Hong Kong just two days later.",
      "The victory over Villa was a positive end to a chastening season for the Red Devils. Their win over Unai Emery's side lifted them up to 15th position, which saw them finish the campaign with 11 victories, nine draws and 18 defeats. Nevertheless, this season goes down as their worst in the Premier League era and as one of the most miserable in their history.",

I'd had to get quite a matter of fact about things, but I was like 'Oh, my dad does want to donate his brain to medical science.'",

      "Amorim is getting used to saying sorry. Addressing the fans at Old Trafford on the pitch after Sunday’s final-day 2-0 victory over Aston Villa, the Portuguese apologised for their disastrous, trophyless campaign, which saw United finish 15th in the league.",
      "Little wonder he was so keen to close the book on 2024/25, even if it has been extended by United’s money-spinning jaunt to the Far East, with another match in Hong Kong to come on Friday. “It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,” said Amorim.",
      "“I closed that chapter, I’m excited, I’m nervous, I want to work towards the next season. I don’t have that feeling to disconnect. I had the feeling to close the season, but now it’s a new season. I don’t need rest.”",
      "There will be precious little time for the United boss to spend on the sunlounger this summer - not when a major rebuild is required. Failure to beat Tottenham in the Europa League final closed the door on the Champions League and with it a potential £100million windfall.",
      "But a £62.5m deal to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is close to being rubber-stamped, while they continue to be linked with more forwards in the shape of Ipswich’s Liam Delap and Bryan Mbeumo of Brentford. Landing that trio would stretch United’s PSR restrained spending to the limit.",
      "And Amorim’s admission they “cannot do much” to improve their squad after their worst campaign since they were relegated in 1974 suggests doing so may currently be beyond their means. Hence why United are ready to listen to offers for any of their players, despite Amorim’s insistence skipper Bruno Fernandes is vital to his plans.",
      "“Omar (Berrada, the chief executive) is here, he can explain better than me,” Amorim said. “We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League.",
      "“Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course. But our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future. It was the past, so can be the future.",
      "“It’s not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",

      "“I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better, to prepare better for the games, to build that work that we need for the future,” he reasoned. \"I think it’s a good thing for us to take advantage, not to have European games.”",

      "Former Manchester United star Brandon Williams has confirmed he plans to resume his career at a new club next season after last week being handed a suspended jail sentence for a 99mph car crash.",
      "The full back, 24, admitted dangerous driving and driving without insurance after his Audi AC collided with a Ford Fiesta near Handforth, Cheshire on August 20, 2023.",
      "Last Friday he was sentenced to a 14-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Chester Crown Court and has now broken his silence with a statement issued via his legal team. Recorder Eric Lamb also banned Williams from driving for three years and ordered him to complete 180 hours of unpaid work as part of a community order.",
      "“I would like to thank my legal team headed by Richard Littler KC and Philip Williams of Blackfords LLP for establishing that I was not under the influence of any substance at the time of the accident,” Williams said.",
      "“I have always accepted that my driving that day fell below the standard that is expected of me. It was never my intention to cause injury to anyone but I am responsible for the standard of my driving. I make no excuses. I have learnt from this experience and will ensure there is no repetition.",
      "“I wish to apologise again to those who were involved in the accident. Now that the case has concluded I look forward to resuming my career with a new team later this year.”",
      "Williams has not played since a loan spell at Ipswich Town, with his most recent appearance coming against QPR in late December 2023.",
      "He spent the entirety of the season just concluded as a free agent having left United at the end of his contract last summer.",
      "Williams, who had previously accumulated 30 penalty points on his licence following previous driving offences, has also spoken about his issues off the field in a number of candid interviews."

      "The Midlands side agreed a £40million option to sign the 27-year-old as part of his loan deal. But, despite Emery apparently being keen to extend Rashford's stay, the United academy product's preference has been elsewhere.",

      "\"Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",

But United's failure to salvage their sorry season in the Europa League final - which also cost them Champions League qualification - has thrown the midfielder's future into doubt.",

      "Minutes into the press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the alarm went off on Ruben Amorim’s phone at the W Hotel. Appropriately, it sounded similar to a siren before an atomic bomb is dropped.",
      "If ever there is a summer for Manchester United to go nuclear, it is this one. The intended sale of four prominent forwards chimes with the “bravery” Amorim has demanded in the summer transfer window.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho were already out of dodge. Alejandro Garnacho has been swiftly and decisively dealt with after his unburdening in the San Mames mixed zone.",
      "Eleven years ago, Louis van Gaal bullishly said, “I don’t need a holiday” at his unveiling by United, four days after leading the Netherlands to fourth place at the 2014 World Cup. That was the last time United were gearing up for a season devoid of European football.",
      "Amorim insists he does not need to “disconnect” from the summer activity back at base. “It was important to finish the season, that was important,” he noted. “We needed to close that chapter.",
      "“It’s not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for questions! So I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "“But to tell the truth, I closed that chapter. I’m excited. I’m nervous. I want to work to the next season. So I don’t have a feeling that I need to disconnect.",
      "“I had the feeling to close the season but now it’s a new season. So I’m excited. I don’t need to rest. I just need to prepare for next season.”",
      "Apart from the presence of four journalists from Manchester, Amorim had a new audience in Kuala Lumpur. He and Mason Mount arrived to the sound of ‘Glory glory Man United’, a song that was not played in Bilbao or Manchester last week.",
      "The media WhatsApp group for the friendly with ASEAN All-Stars has 61 members. Hundreds of fans have been milling around the United hotel, pens and smartphones in hand for signed or photographic mementoes.",
      "Amorim was in a gracious mood given that this week is akin to a detention for the worst United squad in 51 years. Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi accidentally entered the eighth-floor room reserved for the press conference and were redirected elsewhere before local media could get a picture of them.",
      "United first visited Malaysia in 1995 and there was already an established supporters’ club. The signing session at the team’s hotel had to be abandoned following overcrowding amid intense demand. That was David Beckham’s first exposure to anorak fans familiar with him through United's official magazine.",
      "A United official half-joked that they did not know what day it was after the Sunday evening flight from Manchester. A few players in one of the lifts were complaining about the commercial activities they had been subjected to. Amorim was more statesman-like.",
      "“It's amazing to see, even in difficult seasons, to see how many fans this club has,” he enthused. “It's our duty to be here, it's a pleasure.",
      "“They are outside, following this club for many years and it’s really important to have that connection. It makes this club one of the best clubs in the world, so we are happy to be here.”",
      "United are raking in £8million from their two games with ASEAN All-Stars and a Hong Kong XI. Omar Berrada, the chief executive, is here in Kuala Lumpur but the technical director Jason Wilcox isn’t.",
      "Amorim’s alarm was not related to Matheus Cunha or Liam Delap. “I have the phone always on silent,” Amorim apologised. “Especially on this occasion. It's a house alarm. When I'm away, I like to control my kids!”",
      "There are seven kids on tour with United who are yet to make their debut. Godwill Kukonki, Reece Munro, Jaydan Kamason and Jack Moorhouse have made the bench before but this is unchartered territory for Jim Thwaites, Shea Lacey and Tyler Fletcher.",
      "The injury-plagued Lacey, 18, started four games for the academy all season but he already has a large profile on Instagram, with 117,000 followers. He recently deleted every post.",
      "His is a selection that a cynic would say is commercial-led. United claimed they were carefully managing Lacey’s injury as of March. Now he is making a 6,500-mile round trip to Asia. United sources insist Lacey has been picked on merit, as all the youngsters have been.",
      "\"It’s a good opportunity to see the young players,\" Amorim remarked. \"And sometimes we have surprises like Ayden (Heaven) every time he played he proved that he’s a first-team player.",
      "“I think one of the issues sometimes with youngsters is we push too much from the beginning. That sometimes is really hard.",
      "“You have social media, all this pressure around young kids, sometimes it’s hard to control. I don’t want to say any name (to look out for). I believe in all of them and, sometimes like I said, you have surprises.",
      "“My job is to give the tools and the opportunities for the young kids, try to protect them. This is a massive club.",
      "“That is a big question in our club, putting our young kids on the pedestal and that is an important thing to change because we need to control that.”",
      "No need to sound the alarm just yet."

      "Manchester United are set for a busy summer in the transfer market as they look to try and begin to shape their squad to fit the philosophy of manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 formation since taking over as United boss in November but the personnel haven't necessarily fitted the system.",
      "Without European football next season, it will allow Amorim to trim his squad and any player sales will help fund the arrival of new signings. With that in mind, here's a look at United's current player stock take and where improvements will need to be made in the summer.",
      "United currently have Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton as their three first team goalkeeping options but it would be a surprise if that remains their goalkeeping trio next season.",
      "Heaton has signed a contract extension so will remain, and while there is interest from Saudi Pro League clubs in Andre Onana, it is understood he is keen to stay at Old Trafford, too.",
      "The most likely departure will be Bayindir who has failed to convince during his two seasons at the club. His error which led to Aston Villa's goal being controversially chalked off at the weekend was another reminder that United need an upgrade for their second choice goalkeeper. Bayindir, too, may want regular first team football as the Turkish international looks ahead to a World Cup year.",
      "United would be keen to sign a goalkeeper who would offer stiffer competition for Onana. Torino' Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has been tentatively linked with a move this summer.",
      "United have plenty of options at centre-half, even with Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans set to leave the club on free transfers at the end of next month.",
      "Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez are four solid options to form the back three, while Luke Shaw has been used more as a centre-back than a left-wing-back under Amorim.",
      "Add in impressive youngsters Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson to the mix, as well as the fact Noussair Mazraoui can be used as a centre-half, too, then United have eight options to fill in for three positions.",
      "At wing-back, United also have Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot on the right, while January signing Patrick Dorgu and teenager Harry Amass have impressed on the left-hand side. Amad can also be used as a right-wing-back, while Shaw remains an option on the left.",
      "Neither position serves as a transfer priority for United this summer.",
      "Where United may have an issue is in midfield. Christian Eriksen will leave the club on a free transfer next month, which would leave United with four bona fide midfield options.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is here to stay after a mixed first season at United and he is a player Amorim trusts from their time working together at Sporting CP.",
      "Casemiro became one of Amorim's most important midfielders towards the end of the season but he was much more effective in Europe than he was with dealing with the physicality of the Premier League.",
      "He has one year remaining on his contract and, at 33, it is United's last chance to get a fee for the Brazilian international this summer. He has just been recalled to the Brazil squad and it might be the right time to cash in.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could also leave this summer. His talent is undoubted but after a breakout 2023/24 campaign, his 2024/25 season was stunted by injuries.",
      "Since coming back into the side he has struggled to nail down regular football under Amorim and given a potential sale would represent pure profit, his future is one to keep an eye on with Chelsea among the clubs interested.",
      "Toby Collyer is the club's other midfielder on the books and while he could stay there is also talk the 21-year-old could look for regular football elsewhere this summer, too.",
      "Amad and Fernandes were United's two best players by a distance last season and both were most effective in the two attacking midfield roles.",
      "Mason Mount has also shown glimpses of becoming the signing United thought they would be getting under Amorim, but Alejandro Garnacho is expected to leave amid the fallout from the Europa League final.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea are said to be among the clubs interested and his sale would bring in a significant transfer fee for United.",
      "That would leave them with three attacking midfield options at their current disposal but two dream signings could solve two problems.",
      "The £62.5m signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha is expected to go through, while United are expected to do battle with Newcastle over the £50m Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "If United can pull off both of those deals it could allow Fernandes to move back into midfield to bolster their options in that department and leave Amorim with four quality attacking midfield options.",
      "Up front United are keen to secure the £30million signing of Ipswich Town's 12-goal forward Liam Delap. The problem is that a number of other Premier League clubs are keen to secure a deal for the 22-year-old as well.",
      "If the England under-21 international arrives, it would take United's striker head count up to four.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have both struggled consistently in front of goal and the expectation is at least one of those players will be moved on - either permanently or on loan - in the summer.",
      "Teenage forward Chido Obi is expected to have a bright future and he will remain on the fringes of the first team next season.",
      "The fear is that would leave United without an experienced forward up front when they have clearly lacked that at times this season.",
      "We reported last week that the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are a priority for United this summer.",
      "All three players have impressed on loan at Aston Villa, Chelsea and Real Betis respectively and Sancho and Antony will face off in the UEFA Conference League final in Wroclaw this evening.",
      "United want £40m for Rashford, and £32.5m for Antony, who earned a recall to the Brazil squad earlier this week, while Chelsea have a £25m obligation to sign Sancho.",
      "Those three sales would bring in £97.5m before sanctioning any potential sales.",
      "Dutch international Tyrell Malacia's loan move to PSV isn't expected to become permanent and finding the 25-year-old a new home in the summer as he heads into the final year of his contract will also be a priority for United."

      "However, Mourinho admitted Porto \"struggled\" to qualify for the UEFA Cup following his appointment in January 2002. Mourinho still guided Porto to a third-place finish in the Portuguese top flight, though, and he promised to \"make Porto champions next year,\" which he subsequently delivered.",

      "\"For the fans, the players and Ange, it’s a title. Yes, the game was not amazing, but they made history for Tottenham because Tottenham didn’t have a trophy for so many years.\"",
      "Mourinho continued: \"From what I read – just what I read – the impact on United of course is huge in the sense of for how many years United are not involved in any European competition.",
      "\"But at the same time it looks like they are supporting Ruben, they are giving him time and conditions to go forward. I read some quotes from him saying he’s happy he came and already had these six months. When I went to Porto the same thing happened.",
      "\"I went in January and we had a difficult six months, we struggled even to qualify for UEFA Cup. And then we saw what happened.",

      "After just six appearances in a Manchester United shirt, it is already fair to say Ayden Heaven has made a positive impression in M16.",
      "Signed from Arsenal in the closing stages of the January transfer window, most United supporters were left turning to Google to find out more about the 18-year-old centre-back, who had made just one competitive appearance for the Londoners.",
      "United drafted him in for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £1.5million, and it was anticipated that he would begin his United career by trying to prove himself in the Under-21s.",
      "Instead, United communicated that he was a signing for the first-team. Just a handful of appearances into his M16 career, it is easy to understand why.",
      "After a frustrating period with injuries recently, Heaven made his first start in a little over two months when United beat Aston Villa 2-0 in their final Premier League game of the season on Sunday afternoon.",
      "He was deployed on the left of the back-three and he did not put a foot wrong. He completed five clearances, produced three interceptions, won one tackle and completed 91 per cent of his attempted passes.",
      "It marked another accomplished showing from the teenager, who was praised by head coach Ruben Amorim in a post-match chat with MUTV.",
      "\"Once again, Jason Wilcox is doing a great job,\" Amorim said. \"Bringing Ayden... it is these kind of players that we need because he show a lot of character and quality after a big injury.",
      "\"We want this kind of player.\"",
      "For all of United's faults on the recruitment front in recent years, they continue to be able to attract some of the country's hottest talent. Chido Obi swapped Arsenal for United last year at the age of 16 and he has already made eight appearances, including a first Premier League start.",
      "Low-risk, high-reward signings offer United the opportunity to integrate youngsters into their first-team squad with the ambition of them establishing themselves as Premier League players. Heaven has made four league appearances for United thus far and not once has he looked out of place.",
      "What is most striking about the youngster is his calmness. He never gets flustered with or without the ball, with his composure really impressive.",
      "Furthermore, his profile as a left-footed centre-back is another feather in his cap. Left-footed centre-backs are often difficult to find nowadays.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt this summer, there is no reason why Heaven cannot become a regular starter next season. Of course, it is important not too load too much pressure on young shoulders too soon, but he already looks like a real find for United.",
      "His composure prompted Amorim, after Heaven had made his first appearance for United in March, to comment on just how struck he was by how calm he was.",
      "\"Ayden is so relaxed, he seems so relaxed that sometimes he is too relaxed,\" Amorim quipped \"But I think we have a player there. So now we have to control, to tell him that it was just a game etc. etc.\"",
      "Signing a player of Heaven's profile is just the sort of area in which United co-chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe aspires of shopping in. When discussing United's recruitment errors of yesteryear in March last year, he outlined his desire to try and unearth hidden talent that was simmering just beneath the surface.",
      "\"What I would rather do is find the next [Kylian] Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anybody could figure that one out. But what's much more challenging is to to find the next Mbappe, the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "Having set the goal of attempting to find young, unestablished talent, Ratcliffe will be hoping United can find another player in the same mould as Heaven this summer.",
      "Of course, United need to bring in proven and ready-made talent, just as their pursuit of Matheus Cunha highlights, but there will always be room for them to try and add young talent to their ranks for minimal fees.",
      "More and more clubs are targeting young players in the hope of them fulfilling their potential and becoming either first-team operators or players that can be sold for a much higher fee than the buying cost.",
      "Heaven is a prime example of what can be found when looking at young talent."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, May 28.",
      "Despite the 2024/25 Premier League season being over, United are back in action today with a post-season friendly against ASEAN All-Stars in-front of thousands of Malaysian Red Devils.",
      "Unlike normal matchdays, transfer news takes precedence with Ruben Amorim closing in on his first signing of the summer. Matheus Cunha is growing increasingly likely to join from Wolves after receiving permission to undergo a medical.",
      "Once Cunha signs, attention will turn to signing a striker and selling players to free up funds. Liam Delap, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have all been linked with Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Moise Keane players on their radar, also.",
      "In terms of outgoings, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Bruno Fernandes all have interest away from the club. A host of sales are expected to be confirmed by United after their worst season in 51 years.",
      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "Manchester City have joined the race to sign Rayan Cherki this summer.",
      "The Telegraph have reported that the 21-year-old, who has a release clause of around £20m-£25m, is wanted by a number of clubs this summer. It seems as though Pep Guardiola has identified the Lyon star as an alternative to Florian Wirtz.",
      "Man United target Matheus Cunha has been granted permission by Wolves to undergo his medical ahead of a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Reports on Tuesday claimed the Brazilian was closing in on becoming Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer.",
      "Hello Manchester United fans!",
      "Welcome to today's live transfer blog. My name's Josh Holland and I'll be guiding you through this morning with all the latest on the transfer front.",
      "Here's what you missed yesterday:",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo set to leave Al-Nassr",
      "Ruben Amorim's transfer plans this summer",
      "Matheus Cunha transfer breakthrough",
      "Latest on Viktor Gyokeres",
      "That is it for tonight's Manchester United transfer news blog.",
      "Stay tuned for more updates on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho tomorrow...",
      "Arsenal directors held talks with Viktor Gyokeres' agent in Lisbon and have put a £58.7million proposal on the table to sign the Sporting CP forward, according to Correio da Manha.",
      "Manchester United are interested in Gyokeres but it appears their failiure to reach the Champions League has cooled a potential move, with Arsenal now leading the race.",
      "As well as the Gunners lodging a bid, Gyokeres has been offered £10m signing-on fee and a five-year contract worth £110,000 per week before bonuses.",
      "Barcelona are anticipated to rival Manchester United for the signing of French star Lucas Chevalier this summer, according to Fichajes.",
      "Deco, Barca's sporting director, 'combing the market' for a new No.1 and Chevalier is now a serious option being considered.",
      "However, Lille want around £33.5million to sanction Chevalier's departure and that could be out of Barcelona's reach.",
      "United have been linked with a move for Chevalier as rumours continue to circle around Andre Onana's future.",
      "Manchester United have now met the terms of Matheus Cunha's contract and Wolves have given permission to conclude the deal, according to The Telegraph.",
      "It had been reported that United wanted to split Cunha's £62.5million release clause across five years, but Wolves rejected that proposal and United have agreed to pay it over two years, as stated in his contract.",
      "United have now been given the green light to start a medical and get a deal over the line for Cunha's arrival.",
      "Mannchester United are leading the chase for highly-rated Southampton centre back Harley Emsden-James, as per the Daily Mail.",
      "Emsden-James, 16, has been impressive for Saints this season and United believe they have won the race, with Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal among the others interested in his signature.",
      "Manchester United are expected to receive around £300,000 if Real Betis win the Conference League on Wednesday, it has been claimed.",
      "Manuel Pellegrini's Betis face Chelsea in the final in Wroclaw and United no doubt have one eye on Antony's progress.",
      "The Brazilian has impressed since his loan move from United in January, scoring nine goals and adding five assists in 25 matches for Betis.",
      "As part of his loan move, United and Betis agreed on a number of bonuses should Antony reach them, according to ABC.es.",
      "One of them is that Betis have got to fork out £300,000 to United if they win the Conference League final against Chelsea.",
      "It was conditional on Antony playing more than half of their matches in the competition since his arrival, but he has featured in every one and is expected to have an important role in the final.",
      "Manchester United have made contract with Wolves to submit an opening offer for Matheus Cunha, according to The Athletic.",
      "United have asked to pay Cunha's £62.5million release clause across five years, but Wolves expect two years, as stated in his contract.",
      "Personal terms have already been agreed for the 26-year-old forward and the move is still expected to happen.",
      "While Hojlund has flattered to deceive at times for United, it may not be the case that Ineos accept the offer from Inter for the forward.",
      "Inter Live add that they would be looking to complete a loan deal with an option to buy.",
      "From United's perspective, that deal is unlikely to suit them as they are in need of funds now to complete their rebuild rather than later.",
      "Paul Mitchell, who was linked with a move to United as the club's new sporting director before Ineos moved for Dan Ashworth, will be departing Newcastle ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Explaining his departure in a statement, Mitchell said:",
      "I'd like to thank everyone at Newcastle United for their support over the last year, including Eddie Howe, Becky Langley, the players, staff, owners and fans. It has been an honour to be part of the club and to work with some incredible people. I'm leaving at a time that is right for me and the club, particularly with Darren Eales - someone who I have worked so closely with in my career - moving on soon. The club is in great hands on and off the pitch, and is in a fantastic position to continue building. I'd like to wish everyone connected with Newcastle United a bright and successful future.",
      "Newcastle responded by adding:",
      "Paul leaves with the club’s best wishes and the Board would like to express its sincere thanks to him for his professionalism and diligent service.",
      "According to Inter Live, the Champions League finalists have agreed they will try and sign Rasmus Hojlund in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Dane has struggled in Manchester this season but Inter remain big fans of him since his days at Atalanta.",
      "It is believed that Hojlund's contract demands of £3.35m per year are seen as affordable and Inter are willing to test United's resolve.",
      "Having not decided to extend his stay at Al Nassr yet, Ronaldo has been tipped to leave and join a club competing in this summer's Club World Cup.",
      "Discussing the prospect of Ronaldo's future, bet365's Sports and Trading expert Steve Freeth said:",
      "The Club World Cup is just around the corner and with the organisers undoubtedly looking for a headline act and with the player showing no signs of hanging his boots up, it would be just like Ronaldo to enter the stage in the United States next month. The big question, and a puzzler for our traders, is which club will he represent, especially as we've set the date for 14th June, the start of the tournament, while his existing contract doesn’t expire until the end of the month. Seeing Ronaldo and Messi in tandem for Inter Miami would be something special, while Sergio Ramos is at Monterrey and could also be an attractive proposition. Either way, Cristiano Ronaldo remains box office.",
      "Currently, remaining at Al Nassr on June 14 is the most likely option with the bookmaker. However, moves to Sporting, LAFC and Al Hilal are also fancied.",
      "You can view the full market HERE.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Real Madrid and Benfica are set to meet this week to discuss the transfer fee for Alvaro Carreras this summer.",
      "It is understood that a release clause at approximately £42m is included in the full-back's contract in Portugal.",
      "As part of the deal that saw Carreras leave, United included a 'significant sell-on clause' which would be triggered if the Lisbon club sold the defender.",
      "Any extra money at this stage will be music to the ears of United and Amorim as he looks to rebuild his squad.",
      "Fernandes' comments about his United future following the Europa League final stirred concern among supporters last week and news of an ultimatum being offered will worry fans further.",
      "However, there could be some hope to be had when we look back at what Fernandes said last week.",
      "I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "With Amorim already stating publicly he wants to keep Fernandes, the hope will be that the captain shall choose to stay despite the money being offered by Al Hilal.",
      "Amorim has insisted this morning that he wants to keep Fernandes at Old Trafford despite the interest which is building from Al Hilal.",
      "Speaking to the media in Malaysia, Amorim said:",
      "We already talk about that many times. You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the game, it’s really important. Especially in these kind of moments. The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes responsibility. He should be (taking responsibility) because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, he’s really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, United captain Bruno Fernandes has been handed a major ultimatum ahead of the transfer window opening.",
      "It is understood that Al Hilal have handed Fernandes a £700,000 per week contract offer and want to know by Thursday whether he would be willing to accept those terms.",
      "If he is, then the Saudi Pro League club will look to hold transfer talks with United for his signature.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are looking at Cherki this summer.",
      "It is thought the midfielder is seen as the Blues' alternative to Florian Wirtz who was deemed too expensive.",
      "City are currently working out whether his temperament is suited to the Premier League.",
      "For United, if City are interested in the Frenchman, this is a hammer blow for them as they could struggle to compete with the package that the Blues could offer him.",
      "Amorim has insisted that United fans should not expect much from the summer transfer window due to their tight funds and lack of Champions League football.",
      "Cunha and Delap remain the two top targets but who should United look to sign if they can make some sales.",
      "Well, one man who seems like a gamble worth taking is Rayan Cherki, the Lyon attacking midfielder who is available for approximately £20m this summer.",
      "However, there could be a problem with that plan emerging as we speak...",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on this Tuesday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be keeping you across all of the latest developments surrounding United ahead of the transfer window opening on Sunday.",
      "Amorim has been speaking to the media again this morning and here are some of our top stories surrounding the club to get you up to speed.",
      "In that earlier report from ESPN was another interesting claim.",
      "They say Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze are also on Man United's radar with Ruben Amorim seeking to bolster his attack.",
      "The two wingers have been standout performers in 2024/25.",
      "According to ESPN, Man United have the framework of a deal to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town agreed. They only wait on the player's final decision over his next club.",
      "They say Ipswich have been contacted and know of the club's intention to pay his £30m release clause should he give the green light.",
      "Wolves midfielder Andre has wished fellow Brazilian and club teammate Matheus Cunha the best, 'wherever' he ends up.",
      "The attacker is on Manchester United's shortlist and with his £62.5m release clause, speculation has intensified over a summer deal being wrapped up quickly.",
      "Read the full story HERE",
      "So, we're in a position where Matheus Cunha is expected to enhance Man United's attack, meanwhile Liam Delap is another attacker being looked at.",
      "Though Ruben Amorim, speaking in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the post-season tour in Asia's first game against ASEAN All-Stars, has warned that the club aren't going to have an extravagant summer.",
      "Even if they had won Champions League qualification, the budget was always going to be tight.",
      "Read the full story HERE",
      "Hello and welcome back to our live Manchester United transfer coverage.",
      "The 2024/25 season is over - well, not entirely, as Ruben Amorim and Co. have jetted off to Asia for a post-season tour.",
      "This morning we've had a pretty interesting explanation from the boss about the upcoming summer window, more on that shortly.",
      "And you can expect plenty of recurring names to be popping up again throughout the day...",
      "A post shared by Matheus Cunha (@cunha)",
      "BBC Sport claim Man United's first instalment to Wolves over Cunha will be of £20.8m upon purchase.",
      "This will then be followed by payments at the end of the next two seasons. These payments will be divided into three instalments, with United required to complete payment before the end of the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "Man United reportedly have 'concrete interest' in AC Milan and Portugal star Rafael Leao.",
      "TEAMTalk have reported that United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich are all keeping tabs on Leao's situation. Arsenal and Barcelona are also thought to have contacted the player's representatives.",
      "The report adds that Milan won't accept anything less than £84m.",
      "The Independent's Miguel Delaney claims that Chelsea are yet to make a decision over Sancho.",
      "The Londoners are obligated to make the 25-year-old’s move permanent after his loan spell at Stamford Bridge this season. However, if they choose not to sign him, Chelsea will have to pay around £4.5m to cancel the obligation."

      "A 32-man squad boarded the plane on Sunday evening but there's every chance Ruben Amorim will make plenty of changes from the win over Villa.",

      "Patrick Dorgu played the full 90 minutes against Villa and so he can have a rest and allow Harry Amass to start at left wing-back. Diogo Dalot went off at half-time in Sunday's win so Jaydan Kamason can play at right wing-back.",
      "Manuel Ugarte didn't feature against Villa so should play in midfield alongside Kobbie Mainoo. Amad and Bruno Fernandes can start behind youngster Chido Obi.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side have jetted to Asia for two post-season friendly fixtures with today's game in Kuala Lumpur the first ahead of Friday's encounter with Hong Kong.",
      "United flew immediately after their 2-0 Premier League win over Aston Villa on Sunday and are expected to rake in around £8million from the jaunt.",
      "Amorim has taken a squad of 32 and while some players might not be relishing the prospect of two friendlies on the back of a disappointing season and with international fixtures around the corner, it offers a vital chance for seven United youngsters to showcase themselves.",
      "The Reds have taken their senior stars but minutes are likely to be handed out to the majority of the squad and that could offer opportunities to a clutch of teenagers to stake a claim for involvement in the squad next season.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson have already made their first team debuts and shown the pathway on offer to their fellow Academy prospects.",
      "Godwill Kukonki has been involved in the matchday squad on several occasions but the 17-year-old is yet to make his debut. He is highly rated at Old Trafford and the centre back is left-footed, which offers a vital option.",
      "Fellow defender Reece Munro has also travelled with the 18-year-old capable of playing in the middle of the back four or at full back. Born in London, he has caught the eye at Under-18 level.",
      "Jaydon Kamason was one of the unsung heroes of United's run to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals with the 18-year-old right back shining in the thrashing of Chelsea in the last 16 and scoring in the quarter final win over Arsenal.",
      "Centre midfield pair Jack Moorhouse, 19, and Jim Thwaites, 17, have both been called upon. The former has been on the bench for United this term while Thwaites has caught the eye in the academy with his set-piece prowess particularly eye-catching.",
      "Shea Lacey has also travelled after an injury hit campaign. He has penned a professional contract with United and is highly rated. He's predominately played on the right wing, but coaches in the academy like to challenge youngsters in different positions across the attack and the 18-year-old is versatile.",
      "Then there is Tyler Fletcher, son of former United general Darren. The number 10, like twin brother Jack, switched to Old Trafford from Manchester City and is a cultured playmaker who will be keen to show his credentials should Amorim afford him the opportunity."

      "At a pre-match press conference for United's post-season tour match against the ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur, Amorim was asked about the impact of no Champions League football for the 2025-26 season.",
      "“Omar (Berrada, the chief executive) is here, he can explain better than me,\" Amorim said. \"We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League.",
      "\"Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course.",

      "It is looking increasingly likely that Wolves ace Matheus Cunha will be drafted in as the club's first signing of the summer. The Brazilian has been identified to fill one of the two playmaker positions and United are expected to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Having played as a No.10 at Molineux, the former Atletico Madrid man is a suitable fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. The United boss wants an increased attacking presence buzzing around the central striker and Cunha fits the mould.",
      "As for bolstering the No.9 position, United have also made good progress with their identification process, long since pinpointing Ipswich Town's Liam Delap as an option.",
      "The 22-year-old, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, plundered 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League player, despite operating in a team that won just four games all season and was relegated to the Championship.",
      "Available for £30m via a release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's relegation, Delap is no stranger to United technical director Jason Wilcox from the time they spent together at City. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna confirmed last Friday that Delap is increasingly likely to leave Portman Road this summer.",
      "Already planning to spend north of £90m on two Premier League-ready players to strengthen their attack, United have also been credited with interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo by multiple outlets in the last day or so. The Cameroonian has enjoyed an excellent season for the Bees, scoring 20 Premier League goals.",
      "The jewel in Brentford's crown, Mbeumo, who was signed from French club Troyes in 2019, was only outscored in the Premier League this season by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22). He also registered seven assists.",
      "Capable of playing from the right wing or up front, Mbeumo is a suitable fit to operate close to Delap in the right-sided No.10 position. He also has the athleticism United so desperately need to add in this summer's window.",
      "Reportedly valued at around £50m, there is no doubt United will have to maximise the seller's market to go after Mbeumo's signature.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo, Cunha and Delap all being signed in one window is an ambitious thought. However, it is not beyond the realms of possibility if United manage to offload the likes of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony.",
      "United need to strengthen other areas beyond their attack, such as the centre of midfield, but bolstering their forward line is poised to take initial priority this summer. The club can ill-afford to be as limited up front again next term.",
      "Should Mbeumo, Delap and Cunha be signed this summer, they should form United's strongest attack, forcing Bruno Fernandes into a more reserved role and Amad the right wing-back berth. The aforementioned duo are two players the Reds must retain this summer amid their increased importance.",
      "There is also a case for United to strengthen in goal and possibly at wing-back. For now, though, bolstering the attack has to take priority.",
      "United's strongest line-up with three new signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Delap."

It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour. I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season but now it's a new season. I don't need rest.\"",
      "\"I think that is an important thing because I think one of the issues with youngsters is sometimes we push too much from the beginning, you have social media, all this pressure around young kids, I don't want to say any name. I believe in all of them and, like I said, you have surprises... This is a massive club, that is a big question in our club, putting our young kids in the pedestal and that is an important thing to change because we need to control that.\"",
      "\"Omar [Berrada] is here, he can explain better than me. We always prepare two plans, one with Champions League, one without Champions League. Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way, then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course, but our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, that is the future, is not going to change so much because we have the FFP rules, we are not allowed to do much this summer. It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\"",

      "\"A really tough season without trophies in the league. It's a really big club that is alive and change things… For some people it's hard to understand and see but I think we are improving as a team. That lack of goals punishes us in some games. If I have to choose a positive, it's that feeling in the stadium with the fans and that’s the beginning of something.\"",
      "\"The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball, the team has different moments and in different moments Bruno [Fernandes] takes responsibility. He's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\"",

It's our duty to be here, it's a pleasure, they are outside, following this club for many years and it’s really important to have that connection. It makes this club one of the best clubs in the world, so we are happy to be here. I see it first of all, every game we play we have a big responsibility, we want to respect all this attention, all this kindness from everybody, we want to have a good performance and we have a lot to do, like you saw this season, if there is any game to be played we are going to use it to improve the team, we have almost all of the squad here.

      "United have moved quickly to improve Ruben Amorim's team after the club recorded their worst season in 51 years. Cunha was identified as a priority target rapidly and looks set to be the first new face through the door this summer.",
      "Reports on Tuesday indicated that United had opened talks with Wolves to agree a deal and it's been widely reported that the terms of the release clause in Cunha's recently signed contract at Molineux have been met.",
      "Cunha's contract outlines that a transfer fee is paid across three instalments including a first lump sum and two further payments over the next two years. However, United had tested the waters with a proposal to pay the £62.5m release clause over five years.",
      "The Brazilian is now set to undergo a medical after receiving permission from Wolves with the deal accelerating towards completion. And fortunately for United, they have received the biggest sign of approval from the 25-year-old's camp.",
      "Cunha's father, Carmelo, has recently liked Fabrizio Romano's popular 'Here we go!' update of Cunha's move to United on Instagram. It isn't the first time Carmelo has sparked excitement with supporters after liking a comment under one of the forward's posts reading: \"Welcome to United,\" earlier in the season.",

Fernandes has previously explained that he keeps a close eye on his old club's matches and was therefore aware of Amorim's work before he arrived in the north west.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League this season, there is no doubt Manchester United need to add fresh blood to their ranks in this summer's transfer window.",
      "However, head coach Ruben Amorim has warned the club \"cannot do much\" amid their failure to secure Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Qualification for Europe's premier club competition would have significantly boosted United's coffers, giving them an increased chance of signing Amorim's top targets. Instead, they will have to be shrewd and sales will be much more important.",
      "United plan to offload Alejandro Garnacho after Amorim informed that he can leave at the right price, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been earmarked as figures United want to sell as a priority. The Reds have also made it clear to the players who are under contract for next season that nobody is immune from being sold this summer.",
      "But with Amorim having warned that a hive of activity is unlikely, certainly in terms of a mass turnover, it is guaranteed that some players many United supporters would be in favour of being offloaded this summer will still be in situ come the start of next season.",
      "However, the club has long since been working on plans to add new faces to the existing pool of players.",
      "Cunha has excelled for Wolves this season, scoring 17 goals in all competitions. He has experience of playing in the No.10 position in a formation that features a three-man defence.",
      "Should United successfully get a deal over the line, he is likely to occupy the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Bruno Fernandes could be tasked with dropping deeper and operating from midfield. He has demonstrated several times throughout his United career that he can pull the strings from a reserved role.",
      "United have also been linked with bringing in one of this season's leading lights in the Premier League in the form of Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star scored 20 goals this term and reports elsewhere have linked United with a £50m swoop for the Cameroon international.",
      "If United were able to lure him to M16, it would mark a serious statement of intent. He is an excellent player and has established himself as a reliable source of goals at this level.",
      "Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is the other attacker on United's radar. The Reds have long since identified him as a target to spearhead their attack and replace Rasmus Hojlund as their starting No.9.",
      "Delap is available via a £30m release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's immediate return to the Championship. He scored a respectable 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "Bolstering the attacking department is set to be United's first port of call this summer, but additions in other areas will be required to fine-tune the squad ahead of next season. What is doable, though, will rest on the volume of outgoings and how much money can be generated from player sales.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Delap.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Dalot, Mazraoui, Maguire, Heaven, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Obi."

      "Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal have reportedly made a last ditch ultimatum to Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes to try and sign him before the Club World Cup in the United States of America.",
      "Fernandes has been the one player for United who has ended this season with universal praise after registering an impressive 19 goals and 20 assists for the club across all competitions. However, this form has not gone unnoticed by one of the world's richest clubs Al Hilal.",
      "The team, which currently has former Premier League stars Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves in their squad, are preparing for next month's Club World Cup and are said to have identified Fernandes as a target. In a last gasp bid to get a deal moving before the tournament kicks off, GiveMeSport claims that the Portuguese midfielder has been given a huge offer.",
      "It is reported that Al Hilal are willing to pay Fernandes £700,000 per week to join the club which works out at a staggering £36.4m per year in wages. However, the overall package could rise to £65m per year once added incentives such as accommodation, flights, signing-on fee and bonuses, both individual and team, are accounted for.",
      "Fernandes is said to have until Thursday to decide on whether he will take up the offer to join Al Hilal. If he does, then talks would start with United over a transfer fee which could range up to an eye-watering £120m.",
      "Speculation about the United man's future has been rife since the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Post-match, Fernandes admitted that he would stay at United until a point where the board decided to 'cash in' on his services.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been adamant that he would not want to see his captain leave though. In April, he said his fellow countryman 'would not be going anywhere' this summer.",
      "He added to that on Tuesday morning in his press conference before the post-season tour begins. \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the game, it’s really important,\" Amorim explained.",
      "\"Especially in these kind of moments. The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball but we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes responsibility.",
      "\"He should be (taking responsibility) because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, he’s really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""

      "Alan Shearer claims he will “never say a bad word” against Manchester United again after their win over Aston Villa helped his beloved Newcastle United qualify for the Champions League.",
      "The Magpies secured a fifth-place finish on the final day of the Premier League season to narrowly seal their return to Europe’s elite club competition. Carabao Cup winners Newcastle almost threw away their efforts over the past season with a 1-0 defeat at home to David Moyes' Everton on Sunday.",
      "But they were saved by the fact that Villa, who to finish ahead of Newcastle needed just a single point against a United side fresh off the back of their Europa League final disappointment, suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford.",
      "Emiliano Martinez’s red card on the stroke of half time allowed Ruben Amorim’s men to take control in the second half and score two goals courtesy of Amad and Christian Eriksen.",
      "Newcastle legend Shearer, like the thousands in attendance at St James’ Park, was able to breathe a sigh of relief when the action came to a head. And despite being a vocal critic of the Red Devils in the past and especially this season, Shearer vowed to no longer unleash his wrath on United.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, co-host Gary Lineker began by saying: “You had a very nervy afternoon, Alan,” to which Shearer replied: “I will never have a bad word said against Manchester United again,” before they burst into laughter.",
      "Lineker added: “Who would have thought that they’d bail you out?” Shearer then admitted: “And a certain decision that might’ve helped.”",
      "He was referring to how Villa went on to launch an official complaint to referees’ body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after official Thomas Bramall made a decision that arguably cost them their Champions League hopes.",
      "Unai Emery’s men thought Morgan Rogers had given them the lead after he poked the ball away from Altay Bayindir as the United goalkeeper attempted to gather the ball and slotted home.",
      "Bramall, however, blew his whistle for a foul, believing Bayindir had two hands on the ball, though TV footage showed otherwise. And because Bramall stopped play before the ball entered the net, VAR could not intervene.",
      "The decision proved costly for Villa, but Newcastle are set to benefit from returning to the Champions League after a year’s absence from the competition. It is believed that qualification will help Eddie Howe’s efforts to hold on to some of his best players, including the in-demand Alexander Isak.",
      "The former England captain was then asked by Lineker to voice an appreciation of his love for the Red Devils after their important win over Villa, to which Shearer said: “Who would have thought it? Man United doing the Toon a massive favour.",
      "“I mean they’ve been rotten all season, haven’t they? They deserved to win yesterday. Villa were really poor and lacked so many things. They couldn’t complain in terms of United deserving to win but they could complain against the decision that went against them.”",
      "Meanwhile, United flew straight to Malaysia just hours after the full-time whistle at the end of their worst ever Premier League campaign. The trip will see them play in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on May 28, and then in Hong Kong on May 30.",
      "Shearer voiced his disbelief towards the tour’s bizarre timing: “They’ve got to go and make an appearance. Can you imagine having the season that they’ve had and players sat on a [plane]...”",
      "Referencing United’s recent budget cuts implemented by minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, which has seen free staff lunches scrapped, Lineker joked: “I hope they get enough money to pay for packed lunches,” sparking laughter from Shearer and Micah Richards.",
      "Richards then added in a more serious tone: “It can only get better. We’ve talked about Man United all season. I don’t want to pile on Amorim. It’s been a shocking season, everyone knows that.",
      "“Let’s see what he can do with the transfer window. I know Alan’s made it clear on multiple occasions, will they even have money to spend? What players can they get in? But ultimately, they can’t be any worse next season.”",
      "United finished in 15th place, ending the season with their worst ever points tally, least wins and most defeats. Their only shot at redemption was winning the Europa League final last week, which they failed to do as they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur."

      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nThere were still ‘best in the world’ shouts before the season started, but Martinez has emphatically proved otherwise.",
      "Six errors leading to a shot highlight the growing shakiness of the Argentina No.1, who more often than not cost his team rather than rescued them – though he still managed the latter a few times, admittedly.",
      "He’s nowhere near the world’s best now. His final-day c*ck-up played a bigger part than Villa’s disallowed goal and could well be his final act as an Aston Villa player. Quoting the Mailbox isn’t standard practice, but we’ll make an exception for this timeline: ‘1) Bring attention to yourself that want to leave the club, the game before last game where need a result, 2) Change your agent during the lead up to the big game, 3) Get yourself sent off during the big game’.",
      "",
      "RB: Rico Lewis (Manchester City)\nAlmost every Man City player has disappointed this season. Some did enough to haul them to third, but most went off the boil.",
      "Lewis looked destined for greatness, but this has been a tricky year. With the stars around him struggling, Lewis has looked more like a vulnerable kid than the composed upstart we saw last season. From looking alarmingly comfortable in midfield to being out of his depth, and from solid to defensively frail – next season’s huge. A loan feels beneath him.",
      "",
      "CB: Jean-Clair Todibo (West Ham)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe was willing to risk it all for this guy? For someone with such impeccable judgement, we are shocked that he wanted to spend a fortune on Todibo before UEFA slammed the door in his face.",
      "Manchester United’s loss was supposed to be West Ham’s gain, but the French centre-back had a poor season in a wildly underperforming team.",
      "Todibo played 27 league matches and his loan from Nice will become permanent in the summer for over £30million, for West Ham’s sins. Having officially splashed the cash, the Hammers will be desperate to see some improvement, especially when it comes to one-on-one defending as demonstrated at Ipswich on Sunday.",
      "",
      "CB: Radu Dragusin (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThere had to be some Spurs representation. They did finish 17th, after all. Bloody seventeenth. Still sounds ridiculous.",
      "Dragusin’s poor season has the caveat that he’s been out with an ACL injury since January, but before that, he was he all over the shop. He just seems to be a bad fit for Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs, but he came into the season off a really impressive Euro 2024 which adds to the disappointment.",
      "Being surpassed by Kevin Danso hasn’t helped – especially when the January signing is still no more than a back-up centre-back, but far more the right kind of back-up centre-back.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Igor Julio, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Lewis Dunk and Leny Yoro.",
      "",
      "LB: Leif Davis (Ipswich Town)\nThere were England call-up shouts for this guy when him and Ipswich were in the Championship. They’re going back down and we are not convinced Davis will be a transfer target for any Premier League club this summer.",
      "The Alfie Doughty comparisons were thrown around early, but Davis never came close. Just two assists – despite taking set-pieces all year – isn’t good enough. We expected more from him, and naively, Ipswich.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Ian Maatsen and Oleksandr Zinchenko.",
      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Ipswich Town)\nWe have no idea where poor Kalvin Phillips goes from here. Leeds United, probably. But will they even want their old fan favourite after a miserable campaign at another newly-promoted team? We’d be surprised, but there’s no future for him at Man City.",
      "The player who bossed games for Leeds and England looks long gone. Now 29, this summer is career-defining. He played just 30 minutes across Ipswich’s final nine league games.",
      "",
      "CM: Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nAfter a breakout season and a starring role at Euro 2024, Mainoo was meant to take the next step.",
      "United’s struggles aren’t on him, but we still expected more from someone who seemed ready to assume the role of a team leader. He’s not being written off – far from it – but that next step might not be in Manchester. Defeat in the Europa League final could force the club’s hand financially.",
      "Worryingly, he already looks a bit leggy. He’s dropped down Ruben Amorim’s pecking order, despite seemingly fitting the 3-4-3 like a glove.",

      "Foden only scored or assisted in six games all season, with a purple patch in January (six goals, one assist in four games) followed by a costly mistake against Arsenal and a complete fade-out. The 24-year-old didn’t score or assist from February onwards.",
      "",
      "AM: Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)\nThe Arsenal captain fell from the highest high from every attacking midfielder in the Premier League, but not necessarily to the lowest low. Christopher Nkunku, Fabio Carvalho, Joshua Zirkzee and Lucas Paqueta arguably reached deeper depths of despair.",
      "Odegaard has been the heartbeat of this Arsenal team since 2021/22 but his performances undoubtedly dipped this campaign. The ankle injury he suffered in September clearly hindered him for the rest of the campaign as his influence waned.",
      "The Norwegian recorded assists in five of Arsenal’s last six Premier League matches but all they did was paper over the cracks, especially in the home defeat to Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "LW: Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nYes, Son recorded 17 goal involvements in 30 league games. But if you actually watched him…",
      "Those passable numbers are a testament to the player he is/was but he’s become slow, ponderous, and seemingly unsure of himself. He used to be the exact opposite: exciting and vibrant. He’s lost half a yard in the legs and in his head.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Raheem Sterling and Federico Chiesa.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United)\nA shaky debut season was to be expected, especially when there was an outstanding purple patch before an unfortunate injury. But showing no signs of improvement, only regression, has left the club’s supporters fearing they’ve signed a dud.",
      "He only scored four goals across the entire Premier League campaign. That’s the same number of goal involvements as Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson. Not only has Hojlund shown a lack of conviction in front of goal, but his overall play has been very poor.",
      "By almost every metric, he ranks near the bottom for Premier League strikers: take-ons, penalty-box touches, passes, aerials, shots, assists… the lot. Even his xG per 90 (0.33) is worrying for a main striker.",

      "The gap between the Premier League and Championship has become a gulf. The last six teams promoted into the Premier League have been relegated straight back out of it.",
      "All the while, 17 teams become richer, more deeply entrenched and ever harder to shift. Will next season really be hugely different?",
      "There’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, obviously, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is now an absolute chasm.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "You only need look at Spurs and United this season to see why and how.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just building your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "But if they are terrible, is it too much to ask that maybe that be accompanied by some actual consequences?"

We have a lot to do this summer and we have to prepare the team. People will expect us to be on the top at Man United but I don’t want to think about a big target.",
      "“I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage, to perform well and prepare better the games. To build that core we need for the future. So I think it’s good for us to take advantage of not having European games.”",

      "That was despite him scoring three goals in those first six games, and with things not looking to be improving for Rashford as the January window opened, he headed out on loan to Aston Villa.",

      "We had a lovely Bank Holiday afternoon poring over the F365 tables now 2024-25 is in the bag. Don’t pretend you were having more fun with your family and friends…",
      "After all, we’ve got 21 different tables, and within those, plenty of nifty filtering options and all sorts of other user-friendly features. You just don’t get that in the pub or out in the fresh air.",
      "So here are 16 Conclusions drawn from those very tables…",
      "1) Let’s start with the one that really matters: the actual league table. In short: Liverpool are the best team in the country; Arsenal are Arsenal; Nottingham Forest caught us all out; Manchester United and Tottenham are each a genuine disgrace; and the gap between the Premier League and the Championship, evidently, is getting bigger. Need we go on? Well, yes, apparently we do…",
      "",
      "2) Why are Liverpool the best team in the country? The ridiculousness of Mo Salah has something to do with it, and the Egyptian will be a largely responsible for their collective creative genius. The Reds have scored 66 of their 86 goals from open play, 16 more than third-placed Arsenal in that metric. Liverpool have topped the big chances created table for the last five years now, but not like this. Having created 112 big chances, they are 19 clear of second-placed Chelsea, who might have felt like telling their critics to ‘eff off’ but perhaps their passage into the Champions League might have been more serene had they not been so wasteful.",
      "3) Nottingham Forest, in sharp contrast, have been razor sharp in front of goal. Only West Ham and the three relegated teams created fewer big chances than Forest (58). They outperformed their xG by five goals (4.85 actually, but…) which is creditable. But, sustainable?",
      "",
      "4) Forest faded, but Manchester United and Tottenham unashamedly downed tools in the Premier League once they realised their best chance of rescuing a wretched season lay in Europe. The form table leaves Spurs second-bottom over the last six games. The only reason they aren’t bottom is because they scored one goal more than Ipswich in that time. If we go back even further, over a 10-game period, they’re still second-bottom.",
      "Still, Ange Postecoglou’s gamble paid off and Spurs fans right now aren’t likely to give a shiny sh*te while they bask in Europa League glory. Especially while they can reasonably claim to have had a better season than Arsenal despite being hilariously crap for the last quarter of it.",
      "",
      "5) Spurs and United weren’t rubbish for a lack of the ball. In terms of possession, they are fifth and sixth respectively. So what the f*** were they doing with it? In United’s case, nothing much. Only Everton and three relegated sides scored fewer from open play, while 11 teams created more big chances. Further proving that possession means nothing, Forest are Europe-bound despite having had the ball less than anyone bar Everton and Ipswich.",
      "",
      "6) If Ruben Amorim wants an easy way of improving United, he might simply tell his players they kick off an hour before they actually do. Because if matches ended at half-time, they would have been relegated.",
      "",
      "7) Similarly, thanks to the table that allows us to break matches into 15-minute intervals, it is possible to pinpoint the particular period where Spurs go full Spurs. They start well. Only Forest are better through the opening quarter of an hour. And from 16-30 minutes, they’re seventh. Then they remember they are Tottenham and plummet to 18th between the half-hour and 45-minute mark.",
      "",
      "8) Fulham have been unfathomably fun. No team is more reliable for your both teams to score acca, and the Cottagers have pissed on the chips of their top-half opponents to such an extent that only Liverpool have taken more than the 30 points amassed by Marco Silva’s side. What makes them such a head f***, though, is the fact that only the relegated sides have a worse record against bottom-half sides.",
      "",
      "9) Everton are also proper weird. Away from home against top-half opposition, they won 17 points and in that respect there isn’t a better team in the Premier League. But on the road against bottom-half teams, only Southampton have taken fewer than the Toffees’ seven points.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Winners: Liverpool, Salah, Newcastle, Forest, Chelsea, Moyes and more",
      "",
      "10) If Mikel Arteta is looking for reasons why Arsenal were Arsenal, the most obvious one is they drew too many games – 14. Only once in the Premier League era have they drawn more matches and that was in a 42-game season. They suffered the same number of defeats as runaway champions Liverpool, but too often failed to turn one point into three, resulting in a 10-point deficit, even after Liverpool swapped boots for flip-flops upon sealing the title a month ago. Fair play to the Reds for highlighting their dominance by chucking in the last month, during which time only Wolves, Ipswich, Southampton and – obviously – Spurs have taken fewer points.",
      "",
      "11) Back to Arsenal: for a team with title ambitions, their home form has been sketchy (fifth-best in the league) but on the road against top-half opposition, they’ve won only once and taken the same number of points as Man Utd. Which, as we know, is the polar opposite of title-winning form.",
      "",
      "12) Changing managers doesn’t always have the desired effect. Just ask Man Utd. But sometimes it definitely does. Everton dismissed Sean Dyche in January while languishing in 16th. In the table since David Moyes returned, the Toffees are eighth.",
      "Similarly, Wolves were second-bottom with nine points – 0.6 ppg – when Gary O’Neil was given the elbow in mid-December. Since Vitor Pereira came in, that table has them 12th with 1.5 ppg.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Losers: United, City, Arsenal, relegation farce and more",
      "",
      "13) Don’t turn your backs on Bournemouth when the clock ticks over to 90. The Cherries have scored 10 goals in added time during their record-breaking season, including a couple at Everton in August to turn a deficit on 90 to a victory at full-time.",

      "15) Pep Guardiola, much like Sir Alex Ferguson, likes his teams to put their foot down come January. But Manchester City coughed and spluttered so much through the first half of the season, the Premier League’s best record in 2025 was unable to save their season.",

      "Whistle blower\nAlright then. A few thoughts on the Man Utd/Villa controversy. I’ve caught up now having been out playing cricket and reading/hearing about what was happening from the BBC live feed, fielders, mates on WhatsApp. Whilst umpiring. Good job there were no vociferous LBW appeals.",
      "Law 12 states a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when: ‘The ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save’…",
      "What an earth does the second half of that sentence mean. ‘by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds…’ Genuinely, can anyone explain that to me? If that ball is in contact with the back of a keepers hand they’re deemed in control? If it’s touching the elbow? Why do they makes the laws so ambiguous? I wouldn’t expect my keeper to get away with Bayindir’s error, so (along with seemingly the majority of others) thought the goal should have stood. However…",
      "That, alone, has not cost Villa a CL spot. In fairness as well, I’m not sure McGinn or Emery claimed afterwards that it did. The complaint to the PGMOL seems a little churlish, but it is only a ‘complaint’. Or, if viewed differently, a suggestion of how to improve things.",
      "Villa are not asking for anything specific in regards to that inicident. In the 90 minutes against a poor Man Utd team Villa were awful. They froze when in mattered most. (Palace and Olympiacos anyone?). Martinez’s madness is a fitting way for him to end his Villa tenure. What on earth was he thinking? Hojlund had so much to do still. Hojlund!",
      "Villa have missed out on goal difference having drawn twice with Ipswich and conceded late late goals far too often (Bournemouth at home, City away, Forest away… I could go on). There are plenty of moments over 38 games where Villa could have done better. The thing is though, both things can coexist. I.e. that decision could have cost us CL football whilst, at the same time, Villa didn’t turn up and should take a look at their own performance in that game and over the season.",
      "Anyhoo, three years in a row in Europe ain’t too shabby. I would imagine Villa will be amongst the favourites in the Europa League as well. What’s that Unai? Oh, you have, have you?\nGary AVFC, Oxford (Never a dull moment with Emi!)",
      "MORE: Emery ‘owes the referee a drink’ for screwing Aston Villa as ‘man child’ ruins Villans legacy",
      "",
      "The VAR debate rages on\nSo with due deference to Villa fans who will doubtless still be traumatised, I don’t think the refereeing f*ckup was that bad.  Bayındır was clearly very very close to having both hands on the ball, and there’s so few “player kicks the ball out of the keeper’s hands” incidents that I’m not sure how the ref is supposed to be able to tell whether it’s a foul or a fumble if they’re even slightly unsighted.",
      "I do completely understand Villa’s point about having a very new-to-the-PL ref who hasn’t got much experience of VAR when two experienced refs are assigned to the meaningless Liverpool and Arsenal games – a more experienced ref might have held on two seconds before blowing.",
      "The issue is VAR’s ironclad rules about what it can’t be involved in, particularly the absolute cut off when the whistle goes again.  Going back to the Liverpool Spurs fuckup, surely everyone would be okay with Spurs kicking off, the VAR officials screaming in their ear they should have awarded a goal, the ref blowing dead and giving the goal?",
      "We’ve seen a ton of really dodgy decisions this year where the ref has given a yellow and suddenly VAR is entirely excluded.  There’s also the daftness where once VAR is looking at an incident, it can only give pens, reds or no foul.  Surely once you’ve got VAR involved they should be allowed to give the correct decision, rather than “whoops, not my department”.",
      "I realise more VAR is probably not what anyone else wants, and I realise there is a safety aspect to making sure everything stops when the ref blows up, but surely there could be some flex here?  I also realise there is a certain level of “can’t we just have some common sense”, but I think there’s some helpful flexibility available here.",
      "I feel for the refs having to ref the rest of a game knowing they’ve made obviously bad decisions and can’t correct it because the rules say it’s the wrong kind of mistake.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "What a VARce\nWell done VAR once again for interfering and screwing up and costing two clubs a fortune.",
      "Firstly, having enjoyed a full season without the Stockley Park idiots, we then have to welcome them for the Champo final at Wembley. Without VAR, the Blades second goal stands as the ref allowed the goal, and in all probability, we go up to the Premier League. But no. In steps VAR and overturns the decision (correctly) and we manage to screw it up by sitting back and allowing Sunderland to win the game. Cost to United – around £130m as an estimate.",
      "Then we get the farce at OT when VAR cannot step in because the schoolboy running the game blew his whistle before Villa scored. What is the point of having VAR if a clearly wrong decision cannot be rectified? If that goal stands, then the probability is that Villa either win or hold out for a draw. Cost to Villa – around £100m as an estimate.",
      "That’s two incredibly expensive decisions influenced (or not) by VAR. They should be made to re-imburse Villa and should be barred from all future play off finals where teams are used to not having the interfering prats doing all they can to rule out goals. Leave it to the ref and the lino’s.",
      "At first, pretty peeved that we didn’t make it 10th time lucky in the play-offs (lost the previous 9), but on reflection, I think we may have swerved another season of misery and frustration dealing with VAR decisions. Good luck to the Black Cats – they are going to need it – but I think I’d rather enjoy the game than put up with the VAR nonsense.",
      "Either scrap VAR or fix it, because at present what we cannot cure, we have to endure.\nBladey Mick (Happy days are here again)",
      "",
      "Sadly, VAR\nDear all,",
      "Another Premier League weekend, the last until August, but, sadly, VAR dominates a lot of the conversation. It even leaked into the Championship play off final and the decision to use it just for one game should be coming under a lot more scrutiny than it has so far.",
      "However, for those criticising individual decisions, and the whole VAR circus, no matter how justifiably, I would like to remind you that last summer, one Premier League club instigated a vote on whether the whole thing should be abandoned, at least until it could be overhauled and reformed, a proposal which was defeated by a margin of 19-1.",
      "In other words, if you support a Premier League club, and your team isn’t called Wolves, your club voted to retain the whole wretched procedure, ending up with some of the nonsense we’ve seen this past weekend. It is overwhelmingly tempting to use the phrase ‘We told you so’, so I will. You voted for it, this is the result.",

      "No, this has been the most refreshing season since Leicester won the league.",
      "Liverpool have been imperious in the league from start to finish (until they hit the beach for the last few games) and topped the Champions League group stage above all 31 other teams. No one saw that coming did they.",
      "Newcastle broke their 50+ year drought in the Carabao Cup amid emotional scenes you’d have to have a heart of stone (or be a Mackem) not to have enjoyed. Palace win the first trophy in their long history, seeing off City in the FA Cup final. And to top it off Spurs broke their 17-year drought by clinching the Europa League in an all English final.",
      "We’ve also seen the rebirth of one of the most storied clubs – Forest – as a force at the top end of the table.",

      "He got a boo 2 weeks back for being perceived to have led on the clubs and fans. Klopp (decent man) came in and said his piece to admonish the fans, and Trent received the treatment he deserved (on the balance: minor boos for walking as a free agent; and extended laudatory applause At introduction and at end of game).",

      "But then it happened, the wood work shook, the incredible fans roared, and we somehow managed to get over the line for penalties, and then the nervousness left. You could tell from the expressions and body language that only one team was going to win it from that point forward.",

      "It may well have been the worst season in Manchester United history but a bloody good one in general for those fortunate few who have managed to escape Old Trafford.",
      "Here’s a team of former Manchester United players, including those out on loan who have surely played their last game for the club, who would give Ruben Amorim’s lot an absolute hiding, even with some square pegs in round holes in the seemingly unworkable 3-4-3 formation.",
      "",
      "GK: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace)\nThere have been plenty of calls across the season for Manchester United to re-sign David De Gea, in a majestic combination of amnesia and arrogance given he was really quite terrible before he left the club and almost certainly wouldn’t want to leave his cushty gig for Conference League qualifiers Fiorentina to tend a goal barraged by opposition players behind a more deplorable United side than he had to endure in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "We accept that he probably wouldn’t have been as bad as Andre Onana, but Dean Henderson would have been a marked improvement. He made the most of his good fortune in the FA Cup final to play a huge hand in helping Crystal Palace to their first trophy and has been consistently excellent all season.",
      "",
      "CB: Aaron Wan-Bissaka (West Ham)\nHe’s been a near ever-present for West Ham and we suspect that would also have been the case had he stayed at United. Arguably West Ham’s best player this season and inarguably their most consistent.",
      "Often criticised at United for failing to get forward enough from right-back, Wan-Bissaka’s seven Premier League goal contributions is comfortably more than any Red Devils defender/wing-back, with Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez closest on a paltry three.",
      "",
      "CB: Willy Kambwala (Villarreal)\nThe United academy graduate was very much an outsider at the start of his first season in Spain, featuring just once in the opening 17 La Liga games, but has forced himself into the side in the second half of the campaign, starting 12 games and playing in all-but three, at the expense of fellow Old Trafford defector Eric Bailly, to help Villarreal back into the Champions League.",
      "",
      "CB: Alvaro Carreras (Benfica)\nPresumably in a bid to drum up some sort of positivity after a God-awful season that’s set to precede a limited summer transfer window, Real Madrid being on the verge of completing the £42m signing of Carreras from Benfica is being widely reported as a ‘huge boost’ to United owing to their sell-on clause of around 40 per cent.",
      "And sure, they could absolutely do with that cash, but that’s a well-discovered silver lining of a transfer for a left-back-cum-centre-back that United have been crying out for all season whom they sold to the Portuguese side for just £5m a year ago.",
      "",
      "RM: Antony Elanga (Nottingham Forest)\nAfter Elanga covered 85 metres of the City Ground pitch in just nine seconds, taking seven touches, the last of which was a perfectly directed shot into the corner to beat Andre Onana, a report detailing the United chiefs’ ‘reservations’ ahead of sanctioning his £15m departure to Forest came to light.",
      "They weren’t convinced Elanga could ‘parlay his phenomenal physical talents into breaking down stubborn defences’. Less than three weeks later the club were considering a summer move to re-sign him.",
      "",
      "CM: Scott McTominay (Napoli)\nWe’re not going to pretend we ever thought Neapolitans would be visiting a McTominay shrine at the end of a debut season which has seen the Scot named Serie A’s Most Valuable Player after winning the Scudetto, and it’s obviously far more absurd in hindsight for United to have sanctioned his £25m exit, but it always felt weird that they were turning their nose up at an experienced academy graduate who had scored seven Premier League goals from midfield in his final season at Old Trafford.",
      "All of his ‘pure profit’ cash being spent on half of Manuel Ugarte adds unnecessary salt to the wound.",
      "",
      "CM: Fred (Fenerbahce)\nIt would have been almost too perfect after McTominay won his title for Fred to have done the same at Fenerbahce after years of the pair being castigated as one ‘McFred’ at the base of Manchester United’s midfield.",
      "Fred and Fenerbahce fell short to the behemoth Galatasaray, but the Brazilian has managed five goals and six assists from midfield as a key part of Jose Mourinho’s side.",
      "",
      "LM: Antony (Real Betis)\nHe’s now got as many assists (5) in less than four months at Real Betis as he managed in two-and-a-half years at United and will match his Red Devils goal tally (12) if he scores a hat-trick in the Conference League final against Chelsea on Wednesday.",
      "After two goals and an assist in the two-legged semi-final against Fiorentina and scoring in his final league game, having barely ever registered in the minds of opposition managers preparing to face United, Antony will be the player Enzo Maresca will be most wary about ahead of that game.",

      "RAM: Mason Greenwood (Marseille)\nA predictably fraught relationship with tough taskmaster Roberto De Zerbi has led to suggestions Greenwood could leave at the end of the season, but Marseille will be loathe to lose a guy who has topped the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts, level on 21 with Ousmane Dembele.",
      "",

      "Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton has told Man Utd to “get rid” of six first-team players in a summer clearout under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have had a rotten season with Amorim failing to improve performances or results since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League after their final day win over Aston Villa with only four sides scoring fewer goals than the Red Devils this term.",
      "Amorim’s side have the perfect opportunity to put this season behind them last Wednesday as they faced Tottenham in the Europa League final but Man Utd lost 1-0 to a Brennan Johnson goal.",
      "There are rumours that a number of Amorim’s current squad will have to depart and Sutton has recommended that Man Utd “get rid” of six players.",
      "Combing through the whole squad, Sutton’s first pick to leave was Matthijs de Ligt, who Man Utd bought for £43m in 2024.",
      "READ: Gravenberch, Murphy, Caicedo: Top 10 most improved Premier League players this season",
      "Sutton told the Daily Mail: “If I had to choose between keeping him or Harry Maguire, it’s a no contest. De Ligt doesn’t bring what’s required to the back line.”",
      "Injury-prone Luke Shaw was next: “I’d biff him off now, not least because of his injury record. I like him as a player when fit, but it’s time to part ways.”",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who was another summer signing, also faces the chop in Sutton’s eyes, the former Premier League striker added: “Not impressed by him, not for a fee that could hit £51m. Could United recoup close to that? Well, that’s not my problem!”",
      "On Casemiro, Sutton continued: “His legs are shot. Yes, he’s got experience in abundance. But he cannot keep up in this system or at this level.”",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has scored just three Premier League goals all season and Sutton reckons they need to “get rid”: “United want to get to the top of the Premier League and into the Champions League. Is Zirkzee a player who gets you there? Not for me, he isn’t.”",
      "Similar to Zirkzee, Rasmus Hojlund’s goalscoring this season has been poor, Sutton said: “I don’t think he has that striker quality required for the Premier League. Hard worker but not the source of goals they desperately need.”",
      "But former Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea striker Sutton gave Man Utd boss Amorim the benefit of the doubt and reckons the Red Devils board should “keep” him.",
      "On Amorim, Sutton continued: “Ruben Amorim doesn’t adapt, and he says he never will. To make his time with United a success, he needs to be backed with players who suit his style.",
      "“The issue is I don’t know how much they’ve got to spend. United are now penny pinchers and, besides, will big players want to go there? But I’d keep Amorim, as long as they help him.”",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’.",

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 23:43, UK",
      "Manchester United will invest in new players this summer, but without Champions League football next season, the club does not need a big squad, says Ruben Amorim.",
      "United recorded their worst-ever Premier League campaign after finishing 15th in the table, losing 18 games in the process, and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final means no European football next season.",
      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",
      "\"So, it is a good thing for us to take advantage of not having European games.\"",
      "Amorim has also stressed the importance of keeping Bruno Fernandes at United this summer as rumours begin to circulate regarding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, which led to Amorim stressing that United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",
      "\"He should be because he is the captain, so he's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""
