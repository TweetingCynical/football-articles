      "Manchester United could sign Benjamin Sesko after RB Leipzig reportedly slashed their asking price for the striker. United have splashed £133.5million to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the summer transfer window, but still lack a centre-forward.",
      "United managed a pathetic total of 44 goals as they finished 15th in the Premier League last season, with Rasmus Hojlund netting just four times in the league. Ruben Amorim knows they need reinforcements this summer and has moved to land two of the league’s most exciting forwards in Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "And while there is interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, there could also still be a glimmer of hope for United in the form of Sesko, who is available from Leipzig.",
      "Arsenal had initially preferred a move for Sesko over Gyokeres – in part due to the fact that he is five years younger – but they backed out of the transfer with Leipzig demanding a fee between £68m and £85m.",
      "However, BILD now reports that a fee of around €70million (£60m) could be enough to get a deal done for Sesko, who notched 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season. United’s head of scouting Christopher Vivell has been to watch him personally and is understood to be a big fan of the Slovenian forward.",
      "Sesko is under contract with Leipzig until June 2029 and scored 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions last season. The 22-year-old is not agitating for a move, as his agent explained earlier this summer.",
      "Asked about rumours that he had been lobbying Leipzig to lower their asking price, Elvis Basanovic said: “This is far from truth. We respect RB Leipzig and I am 100 per cent convinced RB Leipzig will also respect our decision for the next step when we decide to do it. Even if there may be – or will be – a strong desire of the player to move to a certain club, we will never force or blackmail RB Leipzig.",
      "“I believe this is not the right way, because the way you actually exit from the club shows your values. Values that you are bringing into a new club. I can understand in very big transfers, there are a lot of different interests but no matter what, I believe in football world should be more respect.",
      "“So that’s why we do things in the right way or we don’t do them. It’s very simple, even maybe in the media it looks very complicated.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been slammed for seemingly \"letting Manchester United down\" after making the switch to Barcelona. The forward completed his season-long loan to the reigning La Liga title-holders after being presented to fans on Wednesday.",
      "The 27-year-old has at least temporarily departed Old Trafford once again following his four-month stint at Aston Villa last season. Rashford found himself sidelined at United by head coach Ruben Amorim after his arrival in November last year.",
      "A move to Barcelona was understood to be the England star's favoured destination after losing his place in the international squad, and he has now secured his dream, with his new club holding the option to buy him next summer for £26m.",
      "The deal will see Barcelona cover Rashford's sizeable wages for the duration of the loan after he agreed to a 25 per cent reduction from his £325,000-a-week pay. Despite the financial relief, former Liverpool and Villa striker Dean Saunders has now slammed Rashford after questioning his commitment and arguing he hasn't earned the right to represent Barcelona.",
      "The former Wolves and Wrexham boss also challenged the Catalan club's reasoning behind the signing. Saunders gave a savage eight word-verdict on Rashford's performances in recent campaigns, saying: \"In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"I think a lot of people are baffled. Hansi Flick is the manager and Deco is his director of football. I don't know what's going through their heads. What have they been watching that we haven't?",
      "\"I thought Rashford was nearer to going down the same road as Dele Alli than he was of going to Barcelona. Whether he deserves that move? Well, basically, he doesn't.",
      "\"I don't think he can produce brilliance. I think a talent is turning up every week. That's the biggest talent you've got, having the mindset to turn up and perform every week.",
      "\"There's a lot of players at Man United who have let the club down. In my era, Man United were the biggest club. If you played for them, you had to be the best player in the world in your position, with the best attitude.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He [Rashford] has had years of [people] getting behind him and he's let the club down. In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Rashford's questionable work rate was previously highlighted by Amorim as justification for dropping him from the squad for the Manchester derby last December. During his exile from the team, the Portuguese boss delivered a damning verdict, insisting he'd rather field his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach than select a player who lacks dedication.",
      "\"If you do the maximum and do the right things, we can use every player,\" Amorim said. \"And you can see today on the bench, we missed a bit of pace to go, to change the game. I will put [Jorge] Vital [on the pitch] before I put a player that does not give the maximum. I will not change in that department.\"",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick gave the go-ahead for Rashford's signing after having discussions with the player. The Catalan giants have been on the hunt for a left-sided forward this summer, and Rashford was a top target, along with Liverpool's Luis Díaz and Athletic Club's Nico Williams.",
      "Díaz's hefty price tag proved to be a significant hurdle, while Williams recently pledged his future to his current club by signing a new long-term contract. As a result, Rashford emerged as the most feasible and achievable target.",
      "United are keen to offload players who are no longer in favour in order to finance a substantial squad revamp. The restructuring process has already begun, with Matheus Cunha joining for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo following suit in a £70m deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Kolo Muani, 26, was loaned out to Juventus for the second half of last season, making a good impression by scoring 10 goals in 22 appearances.",
      "Kolo Muani was allowed to remain with Juventus for the Club World Cup but has now returned to Paris, where he's been given the cold shoulder. French newspaper Le Parisien report that Enrique has ordered the former Eintracht Frankfurt star to train with PSG's under-21 squad alongside fellow unwanted players Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Carlos Soler, Nordi Mukiele and Renato Sanches.",
      "Having paid Frankfurt £76.4million to sign Kolo Muani two years ago and with a contract until 2028, PSG won't let him go on the cheap. It's explained that the Champions League winners will demand a total fee of £52m while Juventus would prefer another loan deal.",
      "United aren't the only Premier League club interested, too. The report adds that Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham all have Kolo Muani on the radar, although none of them have submitted bids.",
      "That's unlike Juve, who want the 26-year-old back. During the Club World Cup, Kolo Muani made it clear that his preference is to stay with the Serie A side, having been quizzed on links with Chelsea.",
      "\"I don't know anything about Chelsea,\" the France international stated. \"I'm trying to focus on the Club World Cup, which is a very fast competition.",
      "\"Once the tournament is over, we'll see what happens on the market. If it were up to me, I'd stay here: I'm really happy at Juve, I feel great.\"",
      "United's shortlist also includes Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, who's fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrivals of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap for £60m and £30m respectively. Amorim's side were in talks to sign Delap from Ipswich before Chelsea stole a march.",

      "Manchester United finally got the signing of Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday after pursuing the Brentford attacker all summer, but the arrival of the soon-to-be 26-year-old will create a problem for them later this season.",
      "Mbeumo was seen as a key target for Ruben Amorim as he continues to remould the United squad he took over last November, with hopes high that he can improve on last season's dismal 15th-place finish.",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last term, is seen as a perfect and versatile addition for United, and someone who can play in one of Amorim's wide No.10 roles and perhaps even at wing-back.",
      "But if he is to succeed at the club in the coming season then he is going to have to do so while missing a key period of the campaign.",
      "That's because as a Cameroon international Mbeumo will be off to the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco in December, and that tournament is likely to be looming large in Amorim's mind given the potential headache it could cause him.",
      "As well as Mbeumo, the Ivory Coast's Amad Diallo is also extremely likely to be called up, as is Noussair Mazraoui who plays for hosts Morocco. There is also a decent chance that goalkeeper Andre Onana is recalled to the Cameroon squad despite some high-profile spats which at one stage led to his international retirement. He did however return to the fold last year.",
      "All four could be missing for a crucial point in United's season then, with the latest AFCON being brought forward to December 21 this year and running through to January 18.",
      "The change sees the tournament move from its previous January to February slot to come more in line with most European countries' winter breaks, and also avoid the final two league phase matches of the Champions League in late January.",
      "United don't have European football to worry about in the coming campaign of course, but they do still have key games in the Premier League over the AFCON period.",
      "United face Bournemouth at home on the weekend of December 13, and that is likely to be the quartet's final game before they head off to Morocco if all are selected.",
      "Then comes a potential Carabao Cup quarter-final on the week of December 15, before Premier League games against Aston Villa (away, December 20), Newcastle (home, December 27), Wolves (home, December 30), Leeds (away, January 3) and Burnley (away, January 7).",
      "The FA Cup third round then kicks off on the weekend of January 10, with the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-finals the week commencing January 12. United then host Manchester City in a derby match at Old Trafford on the weekend of January 17.",
      "Of course not all four players will be involved all the way to the end of the tournament, with a decent chance that most if not all are back by the time of that City game, but nonetheless Amorim will have plenty to ponder going into the winter.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is delighted for Marcus Rashford after he became the first Manchester United exile to escape the club this summer. Rashford completed his loan move to Barcelona on Wednesday, who have the option to sign him permanently, meaning his time at United may have come to an end.",
      "The 27-year-old has not played for United since December, having fallen out with Ruben Amorim, and joins Barca following a loan spell at Aston Villa. He had been placed in the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United by Amorim, with the club’s unwanted players forced to train by themselves at Carrington.",
      "Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been frozen out by the United manager until they find a new club. While Rashford’s move is only a season-long loan, Barca have the option to make it permanent for €30million (£26m).",
      "He is delighted to have sealed his dream move to Spain and fellow outcast Garnacho clearly feels the same. Writing underneath one of Rashford’s many Instagram posts on Wednesday, the Argentina international said: \"Lets goooooo” with two saluting emojis.",
      "Garnacho is waiting for his own exit to materialise after Napoli pulled out of a deal. Having initially set his asking price at £70m, United have slashed their valuation to £40m as they court interest from the likes of Chelsea and Villa.",
      "He wasn’t the only United player to get involved on social media, with captain Bruno Fernandes and forward Joshua Zirkzee liking posts and Zirkzee writing: “Good luck brother” with fingers crossed and heart emojis. Former United goalkeeper David de Gea also added a like on one post.",
      "Rashford is keen to move on from United, where he had previously spent his entire career, coming through the academy to score 138 goals in 426 appearances. “The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,” he said.",
      "“I don’t have anything bad to say about Manchester United as it has been an important part not only in my career but my life.",
      "“I was grateful for the opportunity to play for them. But football is like life – not everything goes as simply as you thought and this is my next chapter. I’m fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and helping the team win trophies.”",
      "He added: “I was clear on my preference from the beginning. It didn’t work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy. It’s a family club, something I’m used to from my past.",
      "“I want to win the biggest trophies and feel like Barcelona is a huge club in the football world so it is the perfect place,” Rashford said. “You see with the team last season, they have a young ambitious team and I want to add my qualities, my personality, improve the team and help them win.",
      "“It’s a club where people’s dreams come true and they win big prizes. And what the club stands for really means a lot to me as well. It feels like home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here.”",

      "Simon Jordan has slammed both Manchester United and Marcus Rashford after the England striker sealed his move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford, 27, has joined the Blaugrana on a season-long loan deal - with Barca holding an option to turn it permanent for £26million. He was unveiled on Wednesday at Camp Nou, where Rashford declared: “I feel at home here – it's where dreams come true.”",
      "Certainly, his time at United under Ruben Amorim was far from a dream, with Rashford jettisoned from the first-team squad, dumped on loan to Aston Villa in the second half of last season and then made a part of the club's 'Bomb Squad' this summer, when the Portuguese made clear he wanted him nowhere near his first-team squad in the upcoming season.",
      "Now, former Crystal Palace owner Jordan has pointed the finger at both the club and Rashford for how his time at United has disintegrated to such an extent that getting him out of the club on loan without recouping any kind of up front transfer fee - they will save £12m in terms of salary - is seen in some quarters as a win.",
      "\"We should lament the loss of a significant talent,\" said Jordan, speaking on talkSPORT, when asked about Rashford's switch. \"I don't think he was ever at the level he was built up to be but we should lament the loss of the culture of Man United for a player to lose his way.",
      "\"Do you remember after the European Championships he hadn't been fit a lot of the season, was in the European Championships squad... came into that. After the European Championships, the club allowed him to go on holiday for two weeks and then have a shoulder surgery. Hang on... Get your priorities right!",
      "\"I think you have to lay the responsibility on the opportunities that have not been taken by the player at his own door, but if you don't create the culture for these young men to respect and value the opportunities that they've got, they can then get distracted by outside influences.\"",
      "While Jordan made clear his displeasure with how the Old Trafford hierarchy has handled Rashford in recent years, he also insists the player must bear responsibility for how his career at United has unravelled also.",
      "Jordan continued: \"Of course [it is Rashford's responsibility], but we know there are very few leaders in football. There are more often people who are followers.",
      "\"You lose them [followers], there's distractions and outside influences. They get more distracted in their social life. They make their decision for their birthdays. They make the decision to not turn up for training and go out on the whiz in Northern Ireland - and things of that nature.",
      "\"These are things that are clearly being tolerated by a culture. Alongside that you've then got the distractions, the affluence and the wealth footballers have.",
      "\"You've got a culture of not being able to tell people the truth because if you do, they can't cope with it - it's only good news they can hear so they don't build resilience and leadership.\"",
      "Damningly, Jordan finished: \"I think he'll be successful at Barcelona because the clear thing for Marcus Rashford is to get away from Manchester United. That's for Man United's sake and Marcus Rashford's sake - and we should lament that because he's a good player.\"",
      "Speaking at the Nou Camp after his unveiling, Rashford said: “I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "“It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills. I want to say thank you for the warm welcome. It's a different environment for me but it feels like home.",
      "“I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and help this club win. They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player. It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.",
      "“I always try to make decisive actions - fast, dynamic plays and I always like good football, so I have always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans. It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.”",

Newcastle insist that, officially, he's staying home due to a thigh injury and the flight to Asia would do more harm than good.

      "“Jorrel Hato looks like a very attractive prospect and fits the profile. He's 19 years old, he's physically very good, he's comfortable on the ball, he can play left back, centre back. I think even in the number six position in the midfield, he would make a lot of sense.",

They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player. It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.",
      "“I always try to make decisive actions - fast, dynamic plays and I always like good football, so I have always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans. It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.”",

      "The fact they have decided on 27-year-old Gyokeres is interesting, because it goes against Arteta’s own philosophy in the transfer market. Usually, they avoid signing players who are over the age of 25, believing younger players have a higher ceiling and will retain their value better.",
      "However, Gyokeres isn’t the first player for which Arsenal have broken that rule this summer, with the arrivals of Arrizabalaga and Norgaard also contradicting their philosophy.",
      "Roberto Firmino has completed his transfer from Saudi side Al-Ahli to Al Sadd in Qatar.",

      "United boss Amorim was one of the first off the team bus when it pulled up at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel, only pausing to high-five members of security staff as he made his way in.",
      "But leading from the front on the pitch is continuing to prove problematic for Amorim, whose summer search for a striker to solve United's goalscoring crisis has so far drawn a blank. A meagre haul of 44 goals in the Premier League last season, as United finished 15th, their worst placing for 51 years, should have made recruiting a striker their priority in the summer window.",

      "Aston Villa's Emi Martinez has been line up as a possible option but United have already been rejected in a bid for the Argentine World Cup winner after proposing a loan deal.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the offer from United was met with \"incredulity\" and was \"rebuffed immediately\", having only just signed a 12-month extension last year.",
      "United will have to look at alternate options and Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammens is emerging as a new candidate after his superb season in Belgian.",
      "It adds that he has limited senior experience at the top level but would still be a good prospect for the future, and one that would excite United fans who have grown concerned about Onana's inconsistency.",

      "Despite offloading Rashford, United are braced to start the new season without a new striker leading their attack. A striker was the priority in this summer's transfer window, after United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim led from the front when the squad arrived at their Chicago hotel to begin their pre-season tour. United boss Amorim was one of the first off the team bus when it pulled up at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel, only pausing to high-five members of security staff as he made his way in.",
      "But leading from the front on the pitch is continuing to prove problematic for Amorim, whose summer search for a striker to solve United's goalscoring crisis has so far drawn a blank. A meagre haul of 44 goals in the Premier League last season, as United finished 15th, their worst placing for 51 years, should have made recruiting a striker their priority in the summer window.",
      "But with 24 days until their opening fixture of the new season, at home to Arsenal, United are still grubbing around for a new No.9 to lead their line, after seeing a host of targets choose other clubs. Liam Delap joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are closing in on moves to Arsenal and Liverpool respectively.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have scored 15 and 20 goals respectively in the Premier League last season, more than United duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. But those impressive numbers from Cunha and Mbeumo do not negate the need for United to recruit a prolific striker capable of scoring 20-plus goals a season on a consistent basis.",
      "The last United player to score more than 20 Premier League goals in a season was Robin van Persie, who led the club to their last league title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-13. But finding the back of the net remains an issue for United, as evidenced by the way they toiled in Saturday's first pre-season encounter with Leeds in Stockholm, which ended goalless.",
      "United retain an interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, who was on their radar two years ago, before they eventually paid £72million - way over his true market value - for Hojlund. A swap deal involving winger Alejandro Garnacho – left out of the US tour squad after asking to leave – and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, both valued around £40m, is another option.",
      "Which striker should Manchester United sign? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Jackson has been pushed down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton. Three of United's league games in September have been moved for TV, with the derby against Manchester City switched to September 14 at 4:30pm.",
      "The following weekend, United's visit to Chelsea will still be played on September 20, but has been pushed back to 5.30pm for TV. United's trip to Brentford – and new signing Mbeumo's first return to his former club – will kick off at 12.30pm on September 27.",

Amorim will then have eight days to make final tweaks before they start their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "There is a lot of work to do – both on the training pitch and in the transfer market – but United have been forced to make changes to their plans in the US due to the weather. The Club World Cup showed just how hot it can be in North America, with matches played in dangerous conditions, and those high temperatures have not subsided.",
      "The Daily Mail says that United have taken note of the temperatures in Chicago next week, where they will play Bournemouth at Soldier Field and where they are based for training. The mercury could pass 30 degrees in the Windy City, but the humidity will make it feel much hotter and create stifling conditions for the players.",
      "United have factored this into the players’ training routines and nutrition plans, with water breaks a must. United’s coaching staff have certainly been warned by the much-talked about conditions at the Club World Cup.",

Mbeumo joined United from Brentford in a £71million deal on Monday and the 25-year-old has linked up with his new team-mates ahead of their pre-season tour of the US.",
      "The squad flew out to America on Tuesday, where they will take part in the Premier League Summer Series and face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. However, United took part in one last training session at Carrington before boarding their flight.",
      "And Amorim gathered the rest of the squad together to welcome the new addition, with the Red Devils boss leading a round of applause. Mbeumo is United's third senior signing so far this summer, with Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon having joined from Wolves and Cerro Porteno respectively.",
      "Mbeumo rejected the chance to reunite with former Brentford boss Thomas Frank at Tottenham and he has explained why he was so keen to sign for United. \"From the start, I wanted to join this massive club. Now I'm here, I'm just really happy,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, it's the biggest club in the world. The fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing, and every player wants to play here. My first top was Manchester United's top with [Cristiano] Ronaldo behind. It's just such a big club and I'm really happy to be here.\"",
      "Mbeumo has also hailed Amorim, adding: \"He seems really close to his players. His mentality, his winning thinking every time, this is the thing I need. I always wanted to play at the highest level. Now I'm here and I just want to show what I can do.",
      "\"It seems to be a really good group, the spirit is really important and I've only heard good things about the gaffer and the team. It's really important for me to create links as soon as possible with my team-mates, in and out of the pitch.",

      "And United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, is confident Mbeumo is a \"perfect fit\" for the Red Devils. \"Bryan's goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him amongst the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,\" he said.",
      "\"Bryan's belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing. We are delighted to have secured another one of our primary targets ahead of the pre-season tour.",

      "With less than a month left until their opening Premier League match against Arsenal, the next few weeks will be crucial for Amorim to implement his ideas and determine who will be his key players this season.",
      "Ahead of their four pre-season matches over the coming three weeks, United selected 32 players for the US tour. The most notable inclusion was Bryan Mbeumo, who on Monday completed his transfer from Brentford.",
      "Several promising youngsters have also been named, including the unexpected addition of Williams. The 19-year-old isn't the most celebrated or well-known academy graduate. He spent the latter half of last season on loan at Cheltenham Town in League Two, where he scored two goals and provided two assists in 17 games.",
      "It was initially thought that Williams would miss out on the tour, with a potential loan move to League One rumoured to be in the pipeline. There appeared to be no place for him in Amorim's squad as The Mail claimed he would not participate ahead of his expected loan exit.",
      "Belgian clubs Club Brugge and Anderlecht had also shown interest, preferring permanent deals. However, it seems Amorim has now changed his mind on the young talent.",
      "On Tuesday, talkSPORT reported that Amorim \"has taken a real shine to Williams,\" highlighting how the Portuguese boss has grown increasingly fond of the youngster.",
      "He could therefore be thrown into action in the States and beyond in one of the wing-back positions, where Amad thrived last season. Williams had notched 25 goal contributions while representing the academy throughout the 2023/24 season.",
      "Last term, he earned praise from Cheltenham manager Michael Flynn, who told their official website: “Ethan is a very talented player, and he comes here now to add that bit of quality in the final third.",
      "“He’s a player that makes the keeper work when he gets into the final third. I’m excited to be working with him.”",
      "Goalkeepers Dermot Mee and Will Murdock, defenders Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven, midfielders Toby Collyer, Jack Fletcher and Sekou Kone, and forwards Bendito Mantato and Chido Obi are the other youngsters who have been named in Amorim's squad.",
      "United kicked off their pre-season with a disappointing 0-0 draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday. Matheus Cunha made his debut alongside new left wing-back signing Diego Leon.",

That defeatist attitude was one of innumerable reasons why he was always ill-suited to United.",
      "Amorim’s first full season begins similarly (Liverpool are also lurking around the corner in October). United were actually unbeaten in three games with City last season, two of their best performances were against Arsenal and they narrowly lost at Chelsea five days before the Europa League final.",
      "United will not look markedly different when they line-up against Arsenal. The best-case scenario is there will be three new starting signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and a new striker. The sight of his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched to his shirt rather than a devil may cause Amorim to drop to his haunches sooner than usual.",
      "Gyokeres was never a realistic target. The top-tier strikers on the market want to stay or play in the Champions League. United do not have the clout or wherewithal to move for Gyokeres or Alexander Isak. There was concrete competition for Cunha and Mbeumo but United were never going to be a tough sell for players at Wolves and Brentford.",
      "Every Premier League club last season possessed a superior striker to United, bar sorry Southampton. Southampton looked at signing Rasmus Hojlund a year before he joined United.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, has overseen a shift to focus on Premier League recruits after United bought only one senior player from a Premier League club in nearly six years. At the time of writing, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta are realistic options who would fit the bill up front: two centre forwards in their late 20s whose value is bound to dwindle after this summer.",
      "Unai Emery’s curious handling of Watkins when Marcus Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa piqued the striker. Mateta caused United plenty of grief at Selhurst Park and Old Trafford in two memorable Palace victories.",
      "Watkins has never broken the 20-goal barrier for Villa, though. Mateta hasn’t for Crystal Palace, either. It would be a stretch to bill either as 'proven'. They would still have a worthy support cast of Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes et al. and represent an upgrade on Hojlund.",
      "After successive seasons where they recorded a minus goal difference and their worst campaign in 51 years, United need a frontman they can get behind. That extends to the players, too. Plenty have always been unconvinced by Hojlund, a signing destined to fail through his exorbitant £72million fee and ties to Erik ten Hag’s agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Between the sticks is a goalkeeper lacking confidence from supporters. Andre Onana is set to continue as No.1 by default as United have focused their investments at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Onana is at least shielded by a quintet of centre backs with a promising blend of youth and experience. United signed a centre half in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. They will not be acquiring one this summer and what has been one of their weakest areas of the squad in recent years is now one of their strongest.",
      "Leny Yoro has found his feet, Harry Maguire has become a captain without the armband, Ayden Heaven has been a revelation and Matthijs de Ligt looked to have got to grips with the Premier League before injury. Lisandro Martinez - when he has recovered from injury - could be more influential in Amorim’s back three than he was for Ten Hag.",
      "There is a potential midfield minefield, though. Bruno Fernandes seems likely to be permanently relocated to a deeper role and you could play him in goal and he would still be the most influential player in the United side.",
      "But beyond him there are glaring issues. Manuel Ugarte’s form towards the end of last season was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final. Casemiro’s good form was reserved almost exclusively for the Europa League, so he could become redundant with no European football. Kobbie Mainoo has been primarily recognised by Ruben Amorim as a playmaker and Toby Collyer has started three games in his career against teams from League 1, Scotland and Romania.",
      "United would like to strengthen in midfield but the issue is the unshiftable Casemiro. Sources say four different figures were given mandates to sell him yet he seems certain to see out the final year of his United contract.",
      "Casemiro is valued at £15million and, realistically, no club is forking out that fee for a 33-year-old who will be free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement in January. Casemiro has regained his place in the Brazil squad after an 18-month exile but it helps matters that his former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is in charge.",
      "United have valuable assets in midfield in Fernandes and Mainoo but the former rejected the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia. The concern would be that United could cash in on Mainoo if a late bid comes in and frees up funds.",
      "There would be parallels with Scott McTominay, only this time last year Fulham’s interest in McTominay and United’s interest in Ugarte were well documented. McTominay was a sellable asset and always seemed likely to leave.",
      "Mainoo’s future is uncertain but there has not been a lot of noise around him so far this summer. His contract has a maximum expiry date of 2028 but he rejected United’s initial proposal of a renewal at the start of the year and it has been quiet on that front.",
      "Realistically, United could get through a lighter season with the aforementioned midfield quintet. A new midfielder should be at the top of the shopping list in 12 months.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon are imperfect options on the left wing but there are senior auxiliary alternatives. Mbeumo has to operate on the right-hand side, a problem position that United have struggled to solve for upwards of a decade. Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds in that he is adept at attacking and defending but United have to play to his strengths after a 20-goal season.",
      "Senior figures at United are targeting a top six finish. That is not pie-in-the-sky stuff when recent history shows clubs have shot up the table without European commitments. Newcastle United nabbed Champions League qualification in 2023 and 2025. Liverpool nearly won the league in 2014. Leicester City did win the league in 2016. So did Chelsea a year later.",
      "The exception is United. The last time they were out of Europe, they scraped fourth under Louis van Gaal in 2014-15, winning one of their final six fixtures. Van Gaal’s tenure got off to a startling start with defeat to Swansea City.",
      "He was never one to play on the front foot, though.",

      "Manchester United are prohibited from signing a midfielder due to the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro.",
      "Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
      "Casemiro, 33, shone during United's Europa League knockout ties but the club were seeking buyers for the Brazilian in the winter transfer window when he went a month without playing.",
      "United want to reinforce their central midfield but Casemiro is one of five existing options. The club would have to generate significant funds or shift a high earner to have the leverage to bolster the area.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to be relocated to central midfield permanently and United committed to spending £50million on Manuel Ugarte last August. Kobbie Mainoo has been used as a playmaker by head coach Ruben Amorim while Toby Collyer has only started three games in his professional career.",
      "Mainoo rejected United's initial proposal of a new contract at the start of the calendar year and Ugarte's form in last season's run-in was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final at the expense of Casemiro.",
      "United released Christian Eriksen last month and have prioritised sharpening their attack with the £133.5m outlay on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a centre forward also wanted.",
      "The club have scoured goalkeeping options but Andre Onana's recent injury has complicated matters in that area. United are not actively looking to sell Onana, either.",
      "Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in August 2022 for £60m rising to £70m. After a superb first season, his influence waned considerably until he returned to the starting XI for the Europa League round-of-16 tie with Real Sociedad in March.",
      "Amorim admitted after the second leg with Sociedad that \"I’m improving the way I use a player like Casemiro\". The Brazil international returned to the national team squad last month after an 18-month exile.",

      "Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo chose a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt for his first kit when he was a child.",
      "United officially announced the signing of Mbeumo from Brentford for £65million plus £6m in add-ons on Monday night. Mbeumo visited Carrington to undergo his medical last weekend and the forward has signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year, at Old Trafford.",
      "The club said Mbeumo made it clear from the outset his desire to join the club and never budged from that position, despite interest from Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle this summer.",
      "When his transfer was announced, Mbeumo described United as the club of his dreams and he also revealed that his first shirt as a child had Ronaldo's name printed on the back.",
      "The Cameroon international is 25 years old, meaning he grew up watching Ronaldo in his prime.",
      "The five-time Ballon d'Or winner left United in dramatic circumstances in November 2022, but Ronaldo's first stint in Manchester was hugely successful and he inspired Mbeumo when he was younger.",
      "“My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” said Mbeumo during an interview with club media. “It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "“My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.”",
      "Asked if he was quiet or loud, Mbeumo added: “A little mix of the two. I’m quite quiet when I don’t know people. But when I know everyone I make jokes and have banter. I like piano and chess. I’m just a normal guy. I discovered the piano a few years ago, when a friend was playing and I wanted to try.",
      "“With chess, I played a little bit when I was younger. Two or three years ago, I started playing and I enjoyed it, so I play online. I have a board at home but I have no-one to play with.”",
      "Mbeumo was asked about his initiation in front of the squad and said: “Maybe I can play the piano and sing! I know I’m a calm and chilled guy on the pitch, but on it I change completely. I’m really determined and focused.",
      "“It comes from my parents. They gave me my values. Also, all the coaches I’ve worked with gave me a lot of advice. It’s like a family and all the things you face in your personal life helps build your mentality and character.",
      "“I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other and I have a lot of memories from the stadium of my first team. I try to go back there at least once a year to see my old manager and the little kids, who have a dream as well, like I had.",
      "\"It’s really good for them to see someone who is here now. They can see that they can do it and that’s important for me.”",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to consider Rashford for selection again after the forward blanked him following his substitution in the 2-1 Europa League win at Viktoria Plzen on December 12. Rashford and teammates Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were also instructed not to be on the premises at the same time as the United first team at their Carrington training complex this month.",
      "Rashford, 27, wanted to join Barcelona in January but had to settle for a temporary move to Aston Villa, where he scored four goals in 17 games. Barca have long admired Rashford, whose 20-year association with United has effectively ended.",
      "Rashford nevertheless wished his boyhood club well. \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\" he said at his presentation. \"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",

      "Rashford admitted he has restored \"discipline\" to his life after two turbulent years. Rashford was rebuked by former United manager Erik ten Hag for attending a birthday party hours after the 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City in October 2023 and he was dropped for the FA Cup fourth round tie away to Newport County days after embarking on a boozy bender in Belfast.",

The thing I bring back to my life, not just the sport, is discipline. I'm happy to be here and to enjoy this club. It's a different country, with different clubs, and I'm ready for this new experience.\"",

      "Vitek has not made his United debut, but his season-long loan with FC Blau-Weiß Linz was considered a success due to the number of starts he made in a competitive environment.",
      "The goalkeeper started almost every league game for the Austrian side",
      "Spanish journalist Gerard Romero has explained that Marcus Rashford's move to Barcelona is being delayed because of two documents yet to be finalised.",

      "Valencia want around €27m for the midfielder.",
      "Man United are interested in Bologna's Dan Ndoye despite the forward being heavily tipped to join Nottingham Forest.",
      "However, Il Resto del Carlino report that Riccardo Orsolini is the Bologna player wanted by United. The report states that the Reds 'made a call' to sign the 28-year-old this summer alongside AC Milan.",
      "Speaking to club media shortly after signing for United, Bryan Mbeumo explained why he chose Ruben Amorim's side. The former Brentford forward was linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur before the Reds swooped in.",
      "\"From the start, I wanted to join this massive club,\" said Mbeumo with a big smile on his face. \"Now I’m here, I’m just really happy. For me, it’s the biggest club in the world.",
      "\"The fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing, and every player wants to play here. My first top was Manchester United’s top with Ronaldo behind.",

      "\"He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April.",
      "\"He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Šeško again. The striker is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m]...\"",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, United have joined West Ham, Wolves and Southampton in the race to sign Idrissa Gueye from Metz. The report claims the 18-year-old midfielder, who mustn't be confused with the Everton ace, has also attracted interest from Borussia Dortmund and Parma.",
      "It's said that the Reds have recently entered negotiations with Gueye's entourage. The French top-flight club have reportedly given the teenager a €15m (£13m) price tag.",

      "Bruno Fernandes and Joshua Zirkzee interviewed Manchester United's players as they travelled to the United States.",
      "United travelled to the USA on Tuesday for their pre-season tour of the States, where they will take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "Fernandes and Zirkzee combined during the flight to create content for United's media channels. The pair interacted with their teammates during the journey over the Atlantic, and Fernandes began with \"let's start with the guy that people are very excited about,\" before approaching Matheus Cunha.",
      "Zirkzee and Cunha exchanged a handshake and the Brazilian smiled as they chatted. Fernandes approached Amad next and he caught the winger's attention by calling him \"Amadinho.\"",
      "Jack Fletcher looked slightly embarrassed when Fernandes approached and described him as \"the next generation of Fletch.\" The 30-year-old asked Darren Fletcher's son whether he was excited to be heading on tour, and said he should be scoring goals in the USA with his \"magic\" left foot.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was next. \"Now we're going to present the man everybody was waiting for. We spent a long time waiting for you,\" Fernandes said, as Mbeumo laughed with Andre Onana.",
      "Mbeumo said he expected to see \"good people\" in the States and \"hopefully\" he would do well. Fernandes fist pumped the £65million signing and added: \"Score some goals, that's what we want from you.\"",
      "Fernandez and Zirkzee walked down the aisle of the plane and the Dutchman spent time chatting to Tyler Fredricson and Dermot Mee, who Zirkzee insisted were not \"young kids\" any more.",
      "Manuel Ugarte sipped on Mate (a herbal drink) and said he was \"excited\" to explore Chicago. Zirkzee asked Lisandro Martinez how he was and the defender said he was \"feeling so good\" and \"confident as well.\"",
      "Fernandes turned the camera to Martinez's lower body and said: \"The legs look fit.\" Martinez winked at Fernandes and said \"strong,\" which suggests the Argentine is on the comeback trail.",
      "Martinez has been on an individual programme at Carrington and his rehabilitation to recover from a cruciate ligament injury is progressing well. Although club sources have been reluctant to put a date on his return and have stressed he won't be rushed, he still travelled to the USA.",
      "Onana is in a similar situation to Martinez. The goalkeeper has responded well to initial treatment on his hamstring injury and will continue to recover around the squad in the States.",
      "Mason Mount seemed in high spirits on the flight and joked he was looking forward to \"spending time with his brothers.\" Luke Shaw then calculated the tour was his 10th representing United.",

      "Manchester United would have hoped to have more of their transfer business completed by this point of the summer transfer window. Despite spending over £120million, there's plenty of work still to do.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon have all arrived to improve Ruben Amorim's squad. The move for Mbeumo dragged on longer than United would have hoped for and their ongoing hunt for a new striker continues.",
      "With less than three weeks until the Premier League campaign kicks-off against Arsenal on August 17, technical director Jason Wilcox has a long list of tasks.. As well as further reinforcements, United must succeed in their struggle of offloading players.",
      "Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona, with his salary off the books, is hopefully the first of five exits. Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all deemed surplus to requirements but none are close to leaving as things stand.",
      "Interest in Garnacho is growing but the Reds' £70m valuation has put many off. There has been whispers that £40m would be enough for them to sell him and Aston Villa are said to be one of the clubs keeping tabs on the situation.",
      "In the weird and wonderful world of the transfer window, the stars have aligned for United to ramp up their business. Ollie Watkins is on their radar and after losing his place to Rashford under Unai Emery last term, could be available this summer.",
      "A swap deal - which wouldn't really be a conventional swap deal as United would need to bring in cash to class Garnacho as pure profit on the books for PSR - between the two sides isn't an impossible thought. If Garnacho was to go to Villa and Watkins came the other way, both parties would be satisfied.",
      "Not only would United offload Garnacho and tick-off another item on their to-do list, they would welcome a new striker who is one of the best candidates to lead the line for Amorim. A front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and Watkins isn't one that should be scoffed at.",
      "Having a player like Watkins in-front of the two summer signings will only make them better. Mbeumo and Cunha scored 35 Premier League goals between them last season, Watkins' 16 adds 51 goals to Old Trafford. United scored just 44 altogether in the league last term.",
      "For Garnacho, his desire to stay in the Premier League makes Villa a valid next step. No Champions League football may be a problem but with the World Cup taking place next summer, the Argentina international isn't in a position to be difficult.",

      "Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins continues to be linked with Manchester United this summer. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new No.9 and the Villa forward is reportedly among those on the club's shortlist.",
      "Watkins, 29, signed for Villa in a £33million deal from Brentford in September 2020. Since then, he has established himself as one of the top attackers in English football, scoring 87 goals and adding 42 assists in 223 matches.",
      "However, Watkins could leave Villa in the summer transfer window. He was reportedly left frustrated after Marcus Rashford nudged him down the pecking order and was second-choice for some important matches in April, including the two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, which has increased speculation about a possible exit.",
      "Turning 30 in December, Watkins might be a little bit older than some of the other names mentioned for the striker position, including Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres, but he is a proven Premier League goalscorer and that could put him in his favour. Watkins, who is valued at around £60m, has three years left on his contract at Villa Park.",
      "Below is a look at the latest news surrounding Watkins' future...",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein has reported that United may have held some 'enquiries' with the player's camp, though was unsure whether that has gone straight to Villa.",
      "Ornstein said on The Athletic's YouTube channel: \"Ollie Watkins, as reported by our colleague Laurie Whitwell, is among those on Manchester United's recruitment list.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if he wasn't on the recruitment list of top clubs. He's such a good striker and a good lad, and they've maybe held some enquiries with his camp. I'm not sure if that's gone to Villa directly.",
      "\"From my conversations with Villa, they see themselves as having no intention to part with Ollie Watkins. They want him to continue with him up front for them.\"",
      "The Athletic's Laurie Whitwell has recently reported that any move for Watkins is based on Rasmus Hojlund's future, with Inter Milan thought to be exploring the possibility of a permanent move for the ex-Atalanta man.",
      "\"I do think it is linked to Rasmus Hojlund’s future [Ollie Watkins links] if he goes,\" Whitwell said. \"I'm speaking to people, and that’s perhaps more likely than not at this stage. Even a sale is more likely than a loan. We’ll see how it develops, but Inter are there firmly.",
      "\"If he goes, I can’t see how United can’t replace him. They would need an option and Ollie Watkins to my knowledge is one of those options.\"",
      "According to The Mirror, a potential obstacle in United's pursuit of the England international is their inability to offer European football.",
      "The Reds will not play in Europe in 2025/26 following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May. Whether this will put off Watkins completely remains to be seen.",
      "“Villa are a top team but you’re talking about bigger clubs in Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City. That’s a compliment to him, not that he has to leave Villa. But he’s capable of doing it.”",
      "Speaking about his form in 2023/24, Keane added: “The kid is so sharp, he has a great shape to him. His movement is as good as any striker in the Premier League. He’s having an amazing season.\"",

      "Barcelona legend Rivaldo believes Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford will struggle to start ahead of Raphinha.",
      "The Reds academy graduate completed a season-long loan move to the Catalan capital on Wednesday. Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages during his stay at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save United around £12million. The La Liga champions will also have the option to sign him on a permanent deal.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of the iconic No.10 shirt. But he now has his dream move to Barcelona after spending the second half of 2024/25 on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "However, Rivaldo insists that Rashford is unlikely to start ahead of Raphinha, who scored a staggering 34 goals under Hansi Flick last term.",
      "\"I think that’s highly unlikely that Rashford will take Raphinha’s spot, especially after the season Raphinha had last year. In my view, Raphinha is currently among the top five players in the world,\" he told Betfair.",
      "\"Right now, he’s an undisputed starter at Barça and already a club icon. Everyone, the players, the coaching staff, the whole club rates him very highly.",
      "\"What he did last season was outstanding, so without a doubt, that position is his. Of course, it’s always good to have top-quality players around you. So yes, there will be competition, but I don’t think Rashford is going to take Raphinha’s place.",
      "\"Other opportunities will arise, and with training, the manager will likely find a way to fit them both into the team. But for me, Raphinha is a nailed-on starter. I don’t see any chance of him being dropped from Barça’s starting line-up.\"",
      "Rivaldo also shared his belief that Rashford will have to earn his place in Barca's starting 11.",
      "He added: \"When a player leaves a club in a tough situation, like he did, and joins a team like Barcelona, it’s only natural that the coach will use training sessions and the first few matches to get a better look at him.",
      "\"Barcelona had a great season last year, so it’s normal for him to start off on the bench. I believe that little by little, he’ll find his rhythm, start to understand how the manager wants the team to play, get used to the training routines, and gradually settle in. Over time, he’ll earn his spot.",
      "\"He’s a hugely talented player — he’s already proven that in one of the toughest leagues in the world. He’s also an international. So, I fully expect him to earn a place in Barça’s starting eleven and re-establish himself as a regular in the England squad too.\"",

      "Former Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo believes the Blues are in the driving seat regarding any potential departure for Nicolas Jackson this summer.",
      "The 24-year-old striker has attracted attention from multiple clubs during the transfer window. While Italian giants AC Milan and Napoli have expressed interest, reports suggest Jackson would rather remain in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United now appear to be leading the race for the player's signature as Chelsea look to secure £80million for the forward. Jackson's representatives are understood to have already held discussions with United officials about a possible switch.",
      "Nevertheless, with the Red Devils desperately requiring attacking reinforcements, former Chelsea chief Di Matteo is adamant that the Blues can stand firm and demand a substantial fee for the Senegal international - particularly given there's no pressing need at Stamford Bridge to sell players.",
      "Speaking to BetVictor, who offer the latest online casino games, Di Matteo said: \"Chelsea are in a great position that they are not forced to sell.",
      "\"They have a number of players that are on the market and they can raise some funds from there, so they are in no hurry to sell. They are in a good financial position, so it really depends on what clubs are prepared to pay.\"",
      "Jackson's future at Chelsea has been cast into serious uncertainty following Chelsea's combined £85m expenditure on Joao Pedro from Brighton and Liam Delap from Ipswich. Both new forwards made their mark during Chelsea's triumphant Club World Cup run, prompting Jackson to weigh up his alternatives, reports Football London.",
      "United have secured Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo for £71m from Brentford. However, following unsuccessful pursuits of Arsenal-bound Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool's new acquisition Hugo Ekitike, Ruben Amorim remains determined to land a centre forward before the new campaign begins.",
      "Regardless of whether United materialise as his destination, Di Matteo reckons Jackson will be spoilt for choice should he depart Stamford Bridge this summer - and that he could see him lining up for United.",
      "\"Nicolas Jackson will have a few clubs looking at him,\" Di Matteo added. \"He's a very good striker. He scores goals and he's got some experience now in England as well. I think he would have some clubs chasing him and he might want to go somewhere where he's maybe more wanted than at Chelsea.",
      "\"I could see him joining Manchester United, and there are other clubs that are looking for him. Aston Villa could be one if they lose Morgan Rogers.\"",
      "Jackson has netted 31 goals for the Blues since his arrival from Villarreal in June 2023. With a contract running until 2033, Chelsea are certainly not under pressure to offload the striker, and Di Matteo can envisage a scenario where Jackson remains in west London to battle for his position.",
      "\"There are a number of clubs, but he might go back to Spain as well, who knows. Should Nicolas Jackson stay and fight for his place at Chelsea? It depends on his own ideas and his motivation,\" Di Matteo said.",
      "\"When your manager wants to sign two new strikers, it doesn't bode very well for yourself. Having said that, if he sticks around, I like him, I like him very much I have to say. I like him as a player - but he might decide to go and find fortune somewhere else.\"",

      "Picking out the perfect pair of boots for your son or daughter can be difficult, with growth spurts, evolving trends and playing surfaces all being important things to consider. Of course, the aesthetics are important, but it's essential that the footwear you buy them is comfortable and offers sufficient protection from injury.",
      "While many of the professionals these days also don laceless designs, laced boots remain a reliable choice as they provide solid support and a secure fit. With so many options on the market, we have picked out some of the best kids' football boots that you can this summer.",

      "Each of the last three reviews on Sports Direct gave the Adidas Predator League a five-star rating. One verified user, who goes by 'Mcil', wrote: \"Cool pair of football boots. Got these for my son for his birthday, and he loves them! They look great and are a perfect fit.\"",
      "The Nike Mercurial Vapor 16 Club boots are heavily discounted at JD Sports for parents looking to give their kids an edge on the pitch. The boots are made of a durable synthetic leather upper with textured details.",
      "The Mercurials, which Nike first launched at the 1998 World Cup with the help of Brazil legend Ronaldo, have a plastic plated underfoot and firm ground molded studs for 'supreme traction'. These boots are currently available for just £20 at JD Sports – a 56 per cent discount on the RRP of £45.",

      "You can pick up a pair of Concave Kids Volt+ boots on Pro Direct for just £15, down from £45. While they're one of the most affordable options for your child this summer, they might not be best for those who have wide feet according to one review.",

      "Victor Osimhen's future continues to be the subject of speculation amid links of a potential transfer to Manchester United. Osimhen spent last season on loan with Galatasaray from Napoli and has already been linked with a big-money move this summer.",
      "The Nigeria international scored 37 goals during his loan stint, and reports in recent days have claimed he is close to completing a return to the Turkish giants.",
      "Despite this, United are still being mentioned as a potential destination for Osimhen as they look to sign a new striker this summer. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are the current centre forwards in the squad and any striker signing would likely see their respective futures at Old Trafford cast into doubt.",
      "It remains to be seen if United have a genuine chance of signing Osimhen this summer, with reports suggesting a €75million (£65million) release clause in his contract at Napoli would be enough to trigger a departure. And if Ruben Amorim's side were to bring Osimhen to Old Trafford they may be faced with a dilemma in a few months time.",
      "United will have a busy season of Premier League football ahead of them, particularly over the festive period. Across December and January, they will face several important matches in the top flight with the potential for more in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "However, at the same time as these matches, the Africa Cup of Nations will also be taking place. Osimhen is highly likely to feature at the tournament for Nigeria, which will take place from December 21 up to January.",
      "Amorim's side will also face Newcastle, Wolves, Leeds, Burnley, and Manchester City while AFCON takes place, which could all be matches Osimhen would miss if Nigeria were to progress to the final.",
      "The Reds will likely be without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Andre Onana to name but a few while the tournament takes place.",

      "Football pundit Simon Jordan has criticised both Manchester United and Marcus Rashford on the day the forward completed his latest loan exit - this time to Barcelona.",
      "The 27-year-old has officially departed Old Trafford again on Wednesday evening. A season-long spell with Spanish top-flight champions Barcelona has been confirmed by both clubs involved.",
      "The attacker, who grew up and progressed through United's academy from age of seven and made his first-team debut at 18, has not played for the club since he was dropped by head coach Ruben Amorim last December. He finished last season on loan at Aston Villa but instead of fighting for his place upon returning, it was Rashford's wish to find another challenge.",
      "\"We should lament the loss of a significant talent.",
      "\"I don't think he was ever at the level he was built up to be but we should lament the loss of the culture of Man United for a player to lose his way,\" Jordan began telling talkSPORT hours before Barcelona's loan was confirmed, critical of United to begin with.",
      "\"Do you remember after the European Championships he hadn't been fit a lot of the season, was in the European Championships squad... came into that. After the European Championships, the club allowed him to go on holiday for two weeks and then have a shoulder surgery.",
      "\"Hang on? Get your priorities right.",
      "\"I think you have to lay the responsibility on the opportunities that have not been taken by the player at his own door, but if you don't create the culture for these young men to respect and value the opportunities that they've got, they can then get distracted by outside influences.\"",
      "While the former Crystal Palace chairman took aim at the club, Rashford wasn't spared any criticism either for his part in the collapse of his career at Old Trafford.",
      "Jordan continued: \"Of course [it is Rashford's responsibility to deliver], but we know there are very few leaders in football. There are more often people who are followers.",
      "\"You lose them [followers], there's distractions and outside influences. They get more distracted in their social life. They make their decision for their birthdays... They make the decision to not turn up for training and go out on the whiz in Northern Ireland - and things of that nature.",
      "\"These are things that are clearly being tolerated by a culture. Alongside that you've then got the distractions, the affluence and the wealth footballers have.",
      "\"You've got a culture of not being able to tell people the truth because if you do, they can't cope with it - it's only good news they can hear so they don't build resilience and leadership.\"",
      "Rashford is join Hansi Flick's team following months of speculation on joining them. Barca won La Liga last season and there will be plenty of competition for the starting XI with Raphinha, Lamine Yamal, Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres all vying for a place in attacking quarters.",
      "Jordan concluded: \"I think he'll be successful at Barcelona because the clear thing for Marcus Rashford is to get away from Manchester United. That's for Man United's sake and Marcus Rashford's sake - and we should lament that because he's a good player.\"",

      "Manchester United will step up their pre-season preparations when they face West Ham United in their opening game of the pre-season tour in New Jersey this weekend.",
      "The squad flew out to the United States on Tuesday and are now busy preparing for their second pre-season friendly of the summer. The tour of the US will see them play three matches, all against Premier League opposition in West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "New signing Bryan Mbeumo will be under the spotlight at the MetLife Stadium this weekend after finalising his move to United from Brentford on Monday. He has joined the club on a five-year contract in a deal that could be worth up to £71million.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has taken 32 players to the US. So what could the starting XI look like against the Hammers this weekend? Amorim's squad features a blend of youth and experience, meaning he will have the opportunity to mix things up throughout the tour.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is unlikely to feature because of a hamstring injury, meaning Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton will be eyeing a starting berth.",
      "Heaton was introduced at half-time in last Saturday's 0-0 draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and made a handful of important saves in the second half, the best of which denied Largie Ramazani. Bayindir, meanwhile, looked jittery every time the ball went into his 18-yard box.",
      "After being introduced at the break for the second half at the Strawberry Arena, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven will be eyeing starts in New Jersey. They flanked Harry Maguire in the two wide centre-backs spots against Leeds.",
      "Maguire did not travel with his teammates to the US on Tuesday for personal reasons but has confirmed he will meet up with the squad on Wednesday. Either Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt will start in the middle of the back three and the latter could be given the nod.",
      "What Amorim will determine as Mbeumo's best position in his 3-4-2-1 system remains to be seen. Arriving as a natural winger, he will be capable of operating at either right-wing or as the right-sided No.10.",
      "If Amorim views Mbeumo as a player that will continue to operate out wide, he should start at right wing-back, offering the United supporters a first chance to catch a glimpse of the club's latest recruit. Patrick Dorgu, who started on the bench against Leeds, will be eyeing his first start of pre-season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes started in midfield against Leeds, partnering Casemiro, suggesting that will be his permanent position this season. Kobbie Mainoo was bright after coming on at half-time and will be itching to start against the Hammers.",
      "If Mbeumo is deployed from the start on the flank, Amad is a logical starter as the right-sided No.10. He started at wing-back in Stockholm but was instructed to trade places with Collyer midway through the half.",
      "Matheus Cunha is a likely starter in the other No.10 spot after storing 45 minutes under his belt last weekend. He will be hoping to bag another start and increase his minutes.",
      "United are yet to solve their search for a striker, meaning Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi are competing for the No.9 spot. The former will be hoping to start and play alongside Cunha for the first time.",
      "United's strongest XI vs West Ham: Heaton; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Mbeumo, Mainoo, Fernandes, Dorgu; Amad, Cunha; Hojlund.",

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Manchester United face a race against time to sign a new striker in the summer transfer window after completing the signing of Bryan Mbeumo this week.",
      "The 25-year-old joined for a fee of £65million plus £6m in add-ons after weeks of negotiations. Alongside Matheus Cunha, Ruben Amorim has now successfully bolstered his attacking midfield options.",
      "Now, the priority is a new striker with a replacement for Rasmus Hojlund expected to come in. Viktor Gyokeres had been linked with United but the Sporting CP star is set to join Arsenal.",
      "Ollie Watkins, Benjamin Sesko, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Evanilson have all been mentioned as potential alternatives. The Premier League season kicks-off in three weeks against the Gunners and at the moment, United will line-up without a new striker.",
      "United's decision to prioritise a move for Cunha and Mbeumo have meant they have fallen behind in the striker market. Missing out on Liam Delap was a blow, especially at £30m, and watching Gyokeres move to Arsenal is their own-doing from last season.",
      "It's clear they need a goalscorer who can link-up with play, but more importantly, one who can put the ball in the back of the net. The Reds have to decide whether they want to gamble on Sesko, pay the big bucks and bring in a striker whose all-round player is very good.",
      "Or do they go for Premier League experience? In that case, Watkins is the perfect answer. At 29, he's in his peak and his record in front of goal for Aston Villa has made him become one of England's best strikers.",
      "At £60m, United will be getting a fast, prolific striker who knows the Premier League inside out.",
      "Throughout the majority of this window, I have been like a broken record insisting that United look at Victor Osimhen. That deal looks like a complete non-starter now with the Nigerian set for a switch to Galatasaray.",
      "As such, I have had to reassess the market and while I think Watkins would definitely be an improvement, the gamble I think United should take is on Sesko. While he does not have experience in the Premier League, he has a similar profile to Gyokeres who blossomed in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "The RB Leipzig man looks like he is ready for his next chapter away from the Bundesliga and his re-sale value will be enticing to Ineos if they can stump up the money that the Red Bull franchise want. While Watkins has proven himself in the Premier League, his price tag for his age does not seem like the smartest move United can make.",
      "Sesko meanwhile has experience of Champions League football and could, if things go well, lead the frontline for years to come. For that reason, he is the player I think United should be targeting this summer.",
      "United will be asking for trouble if they make the same mistake and don't sign an experienced striker for a third successive summer. Will they be that foolish? You wouldn't bet against it.",
      "They have already missed out on Liam Delap this summer, but that could be a blessing in disguise. Delap is just four days Rasmus Hojlund's junior, and he would have been under enormous pressure if he had moved to Old Trafford. The kind of pressure that makes players crumble.",
      "United need someone who has a proven record of scoring goals, and the closest player to the profile they need on the market is Victor Osimhen. He scored 37 goals in 41 appearances for Galatasaray last season, having moved to Turkey on loan because his move to Chelsea last summer collapsed at the eleventh hour.",
      "Galatasaray are keen to sign him permanently and there is interest from the Saudi Pro League, but if United want to give Ruben Amorim the tools he needs to succeed at Old Trafford then they should be doing all they can to sign Osimhen.",
      "Watkins is fully proven in the Premier League and with the attack Amorim has built so far by signing Cunha and Mbeumo, that looks like a solid trio who would bounce off one another.",
      "But his signing, at 29-years-old, would be put into that bracket of star players United have fallen into the trap of signing towards the tail end of their best years. They'd get one good season, maybe two out of him at best.",
      "They need to continue building for the future and although it may come at a financial risk, Sesko is the best option on the market. Quick, strong and can just about score from anywhere inside the opposition's half.",
      "United need to wrap up a deal for Sesko as soon as possible. The summer transfer window doesn't shut until September, but Ruben Amorim won't want any disruptions or distractions in the opening weeks of the new Premier League season.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wasn't great last season, but I think he still has something to offer as a backup to the RB Leipzig striker or perhaps as one of the 10s in Ruben Amorim's system. Rasmus Hojlund, however, seems like a lost cause.",
      "United could do with a lot of new players, but a striker would breathe new life into the starting lineup. A statement signing like Sesko would show that the Reds are serious about climbing to the top of the food chain.",
      "Although he might cost the most out of those on Manchester United's centre forward shortlist, I do think that the Reds should break the bank and attempt to sign Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea. For me, he is the best option on the list and has the potential to take United to the next level this season.",
      "Jackson has received some criticism for his discipline in recent months - adding to the finishing issues that he has - but if you can finetune both of them there is an elite Premier League striker in there. His output last season wasn't even that bad, either, scoring 13 goals and adding six assists in 37 matches.",
      "If United can lower Chelsea's asking price to around £65m, I think it's a deal that HAS to happen this summer. A front three of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Jackson would be excellent for United.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been accused of letting Manchester United down as he closes in on a move to Barcelona.",
      "The forward passed a medical after travelling to Catalonia on Sunday night ahead of a proposed season-long loan to the current La Liga champions. The 27-year-old is expected to spend his time away from Old Trafford once again next term after his four-month spell at Aston Villa earlier this year.",
      "Rashford was frozen out at United by head coach Ruben Amorim following his appointment in November last year. Joining Barcelona was believed to be the England international's preferred option after falling out of favour and he now appears to have got his wish, with the deal reportedly including an option to make the switch permanent.",
      "The agreement will see Barcelona cover Rashford's £325,000-a-week wages for the season after he is said to have accepted a 25 per cent cut in his pay, saving United a considerable amount of money. However, former Liverpool and Villa striker Dean Saunders has now slammed Rashford after questioning his attitude and claiming he does not deserve to play for Barcelona following his mixed performances in recent years.",
      "The ex-Wolves and Wrexham manager also questioned the Spanish club's logic in signing him.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Saunders said: \"I think a lot of people are baffled. Hansi Flick is the manager and Deco is his director of football. I don't know what's going through their heads. What have they been watching that we haven't?",
      "\"I thought Rashford was nearer to going down the same road as Dele Alli than he was of going to Barcelona. Whether he deserves that move? Well, basically, he doesn’t.",
      "\"I don't think he can produce brilliance. I think a talent is turning up every week. That's the biggest talent you’ve got, having the mindset to turn up and perform every week.",
      "\"There's a lot of players at Man United who have let the club down. In my era, Man United were the biggest club. If you played for them, you had to be the best player in the world in your position, with the best attitude.\"",
      "He added: \"He [Rashford] has had years of [people] getting behind him and he's let the club down. In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Rashford's lack of work ethic was previously cited by Amorim as a reason for leaving him out of the squad for the Manchester derby last December. During his continued absence from the team, the Portuguese boss made a scathing comment, claiming he'd rather play his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach than field a player who lack commitment.",
      "\"If you do the maximum and do the right things, we can use every player,\" Amorim said. \"And you can see today on the bench, we missed a bit of pace to go, to change the game. I will put [Jorge] Vital [on the pitch] before I put a player that does not give the maximum. I will not change in that department.\"",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick gave the green light to Rashford's imminent signing after holding direct talks with the player. The club has been actively searching for a left-sided forward this summer, with Rashford understood to be high on their shortlist alongside Liverpool's Luis Díaz and Athletic Club's Nico Williams.",
      "However, Díaz's price tag proved to be a major stumbling block, and Williams recently committed his future to his current team with a new long-term deal. As a result, Rashford emerged as the most viable and attainable target.",
      "Meanwhile, United are looking to offload several out-of-favour players to fund a major squad overhaul. The rebuild is already underway, with Matheus Cunha arriving for £62.5 million and Bryan Mbeumo following in a £70 million move.",

Their interest had been halted due to contract negotiations in Spain but an interesting development could open the door for United to move.",
      "MARCA have reported that the midfielder has turned down fresh terms to stay at the Mestalla in the past week. The same report has added that United are working on a deal 'behind-the-scenes' to sign the Spain Under-21s international.",
      "A fee of no less than £17m is understood to be what Valencia want for the midfielder after learning of the player's decision not to sign a new deal. It's a deal that would gift Amorim another midfield option at a bargain fee to allow funds to be spent elsewhere.",
      "The report from Marca has been followed-up by journalist Sebastien Vidal, who suggested that United are finalising the conditions of a £21.5m deal for Guerra. It's not thought that personal terms will be a problem to bring the Spaniard to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United have been informed by Real Betis that they could abandon their pursuit of winger Antony this summer if the deal is not viable.",
      "The Brazilian was quickly loaned to the La Liga club in the January transfer window as it became clear that he would not fit into Ruben Amorim's system. In Seville, Antony rediscovered his best form and managed to inspire his team to the final of the Conference League.",
      "Upon his return to Old Trafford, Antony was one of five players who informed the club that he wished to move in the summer transfer window. This instinctively alerted Real Betis to the prospect of re-signing the Brazilian and while Antony enjoyed his time in Spain, the finances involved could be a sticking point.",
      "Currently, it appears that Real are the only side realistically interested in Antony which is a concern in of itself considering that United need to sell players in order to buy now. However, the La Liga club's interest is not believed to be indefinite.",
      "Speaking to Diario de Sevilla, Betis president Angel Haro updated them on a move for Antony and it is not exactly the news United will have wanted to hear. \"From an economic standpoint, it has to fit within our parameters. A purchase depends on United’s price.",
      "\"A loan rather than a purchase is more feasible, given what Manchester wants to ask for. We’re assuming, and Betis is making efforts, that he can arrive, but if he doesn’t, I don’t want it to be seen as a failure.",
      "\"It’s difficult to bring in a player of this quality and such a high financial compensation.\" Adding to this, their sporting director Manu Fajardo added: \"Our responsibility is to be prepared, and we have alternatives in case Antony doesn’t arrive. We’re calm.\"",
      "All this comes as Marcus Rashford nears a loan move to Barcelona. In the meantime, Antony has returned to Manchester awaiting an update on his future having not been included in the pre-season tour of the USA.",

      "Man Utd are still struggling to offload Antony this summer with Real Betis struggling to meet the Red Devils’ demands for a deal, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are gradually bringing in the players they want this summer with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon signed so far.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to sign a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts with INEOS backing Ruben Amorim despite their terrible performance last season.",
      "But the Red Devils could now have to concentrate on outgoings if they are to bring in more players with Marcus Rashford the first of their ‘bomb squad’ out the door after the England international joined Barcelona on Wednesday.",
      "Man Utd are still looking to sell Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia this summer as they make room for new arrivals.",
      "Antony spent part of last season on loan at Real Betis after it became clear he wasn’t part of Amorim’s plans and the Spanish side are keen to have him back.",
      "However, Real Betis president Angel Hato has explained that a loan is “more feasible” for them as Man Utd are asking for a lot of money for a permanent transfer.",
      "Hato said: “From an economic standpoint, it has to fit within our parameters. A purchase depends on United’s price. A loan rather than a purchase is more feasible, given what United want to ask for.",
      "“We’re assuming, and Betis are making efforts, that he can arrive, but if he doesn’t, I don’t want it to be seen as a failure. It’s difficult to bring in a player of this quality and such a high financial compensation.”",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo added: “Our responsibility is to be prepared, and we have alternatives in case Antony doesn’t arrive. We’re calm.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Tottenham make ‘shock’ approach for Man Utd star as they ‘actually stand a chance’ of doing a deal\n👉 Rodrygo set to top terrible list of Real Madrid stars moving to the Premier League\n👉 Man Utd ‘open talks’ with Ligue 1 teen as Zirkzee taps up £34.6m star in Nottingham Forest hijack",
      "‘Atletico Madrid are keeping an eye on his situation, but the winger is not a priority for them at this time. ‘",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen reckons Antony should push to join Betis on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Meulensteen said in April: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are set to be ‘exploited’ as they face ‘paying millions’ to ‘offload’ three players this summer.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘gained strength in recent hours’ in the Barcelona offices and no, it’s not poor old Marcus Rashford.",
      "According to reports, one key issue is preventing Manchester United from completing a double deal worth around £65m in a triple blow for the Red Devils.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided more details on Alejandro Garnacho’s future after he ‘informed’ Manchester United of his ‘wish to leave’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United have been ‘offered a swap deal’ to offload £86m flop Antony to Serie A giants Juventus."

      "Ruben Amorim is pretty high in the betting, with only four Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "19) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "12=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "7=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2=) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "The idea that Mikel Arteta must either win the Premier League title this season or be sacked by Arsenal next summer is flawed for a number of reasons.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s ‘cheating’ is tipped to push Arsenal down to fourth as the Gunners are defended over Thomas Partey and Liverpool fears are allayed.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Mikel Arteta is pushing Arsenal to complete a deal for Viktor Gyokeres today after the Sporting star entered a seventh day of ‘unexcused absence’.",
      "Mikel Arteta loves an excuse and can blame his sacking at the end of another trophyless season on Andrea Berta, Liverpool and fans of The Arsenal."

      "An independent commission hearing to examine 115 charges laid by the Premier League against Man City started in September and ended in December.",
      "The Premier League opened an investigation into Man City way back in 2018 and after a number of legal delays, charges were finally laid in February 2023 and the club were referred to an independent commission.",
      "The charges against the Citizens relate to the requirement to accurately report financial information, including around the value of sponsorship deals, the submission of details of manager and player pay information and to a club’s responsibility as a Premier League member to adhere to UEFA’s financial regulations and to the league’s own profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "They are also accused of failing to co-operate with the league’s investigation. In all, there are charges relating to every season between 2009-10 and 2022-23.",
      "Man City issued a statement strenuously denying the allegations on the day the charges were brought, saying they they welcomed the opportunity for an independent commission “to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of our position.”",

      "During the period that the charges relate to, Mourinho’s Man Utd side finished second to Man City in the 2017/18 campaign before the Portuguese coach lost his job the following season.",
      "Speaking about his time at Man Utd, the current Fenerbahce boss told Portuguese outlet Canal 11: “There’s a critical moment at that club, not only with Sir Alex’s departure, but also with David Gill’s. David Moyes came in, but when my Netflix documentary comes out, the story will be told.",
      "“I’ll arrive later, and when I arrive, I’ll arrive at a club still going through that period. We won several things, we finished second in the league. I still say I don’t understand clubs that are punished with financial fair play and pay [in cash].",

      "20) Rodri – Man City to Real Madrid\nWe’re told that Real are offering Eduardo Camavinga, Rodrygo and €40million for Rodri. Real probably value that package at around £170million. Which feels like a lot for a player coming off the back of a serious knee injury. But probably still not enough for City to seriously consider.",

      "19) 🆕 Kobbie Mainoo – Manchester United to Tottenham\nSpurs have made an enquiry to United over Mainoo, whose contract talks with his boyhood club are not progressing as quickly as either side might hope. That shouldn’t prompt panic, though, since the midfielder’s current terms expire in 2027 and United have the option to go for another 12 months beyond that. Still, does Mainoo fit Ruben Amorim’s system? He might be their best chance of getting some decent money in this summer.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt’s been pretty quiet around Gordon so far this summer, but it seems someone is trying to drum up the noise. We all know he would probably walk to Anfield to join Liverpool, so most likely the stirring is being done by the those close to the player. Which might do the trick since the Reds will be on the lookout for a replacement should they get big money from Bayern for Luis Diaz. This feels more likely than Liverpool going for Rodrygo.",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "16) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho is being linked with Chelsea and Spurs but the noise seems to be building around Villa. Morgan Rogers to Chelsea, then Garnacho to Villa? The Villans would turn a profit from any such dealing and if they sit tight, they could get Garnacho for even less than the current asking price of around £40million. If they are really clever, they could probably get him on loan. And we know he likes a Villa shirt.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Antony – Manchester United to Atletico Madrid \nUnited have hoped Real Betis would somehow find the funds to pay £30million to make Antony’s loan a permanent arrangement, but they appear to have been stalling for time all summer. According to reports in Spain, Atletico are ready to step into the breach. Though neither are they likely to be a simple answer to United’s problem here.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And their immediate pursuit of Hugo Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it’s suddenly all got a bit weird around Isak. On Saturday, he was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Now we learn that Isak is not part of the Toon’s squad for their tour of Asia. A thigh injury is said to be to blame but you will have to pardon our scepticism after Howe’s comments at the weekend. We don’t think this one is done just yet.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nJuve have finally confirmed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao so the Old Lady must now sell to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary. How will he cope?",
      "",
      "6) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford, who have already lost one forward to Manchester United. Given the Bees know Newcastle were prepared to spend big on Hugo Ekitike or Joao Pedro, the Magpies can expect a rough ride. They will have to try a lot harder than £25million.Brentford want £40million for a player who’s returned to the UK from the Bees’ pre-season training camp to get his future sorted.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "4) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player missed the start of Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner but joined up on Wednesday. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. On Tuesday, Ornstein reported that Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for. Gyokeres is said to be waiting, passport in hand, to join Arsenal in Asia.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThe delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer but this one has really dragged. Mosquera is in Singapore with his new team-mates but still we wait.",

      "A report last week claimed Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "United are ‘understood to be admirers of Sesko’s all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League’ and the RB Leipzig star ‘would favour a move to Old Trafford over other destinations’.",
      "The Slovenian is ‘not the only name under consideration’ with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson also potential options.",
      "The report added that as Sesko is ‘open to the move and willing to forgo European football in the short term, United are weighing up whether to make a concrete push’.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein then confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",
      "That’s less than the Gunners could end up paying for Viktor Gyokeres, who was below Sesko in Mikel Arteta’s new No.9 pecking order but became the top target after Leipzig made it clear to Arsenal that they wouldn’t budge in their valuation of Sesko.",
      "They have now budged and we imagine Arsenal won’t be best pleased if United manage to secure his signing for the £59m that they were perfectly willing to pay for the Slovenian.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Tottenham make ‘shock’ approach for Man Utd star as they ‘actually stand a chance’ of doing a deal\n👉 Rodrygo set to top terrible list of Real Madrid stars moving to the Premier League\n👉 Man Utd ‘open talks’ with Ligue 1 teen as Zirkzee taps up £34.6m star in Nottingham Forest hijack",
      "Falk claims Leipzig – who won’t be playing Champions League football next season – have a ‘target’ figure in mind for player sales, with Xavi Simons set to make up around half of that figure as he nears a move to Chelsea, with Sesko the only other player in the squad they could sell to make up the rest.",
      "“It’s worth noting that Leipzig have to sell players this summer,” Falk told the Daily Briefing. “They have a target to bring in €100m (£86.6m, $117m), and they have just two players in this range who can make the club money.",
      "“Xavi Simons, of course, is one such footballer, with the other being Benjamin Sesko. So, it could be that the club has to sell both players in this summer’s transfer window. That’s why Manchester United will definitely be an option.”",
      "On comparisons to Erling Haaland, Falk continued: “Sesko is a fan of the Premier League and is prepared to make this next step.",
      "“He has a lot of self-confidence – he’s on record as telling reporters that he believes he’s similar in profile to Erling Haaland: ‘My teammates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I’m better than him.’",
      "“So, you see, he’s not afraid of big names or big clubs! I think this transfer can gather real pace now that Arsenal are no longer at the table.”",
      "Man Utd have been told what they will need to pay to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer after David Ornstein revealed the Red Devils have held ‘talks’ over the RB ...",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool signings have received the ‘Here we go’, which has opened the door for new faces to get into our top 10 available strikers ranking.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the three strikers Man Utd have held ‘talks’ about after also enquiring over Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres."

He joined after a decent spell at Werder Bremen, but he could not adapt to life in England and joined Galatasaray on loan in September 2022 and permanently a year later after making four Championship appearances.

      "43) Ademola Lookman (Fulham)\nLookman, like Kabak, features twice on this list. Also like the Turkish defender, both transfers from the Bundesliga were loans. The winger didn’t do much for Fulham and cost them a loan fee, whereas he did not for Leicester and had a more memorable spell at the King Power, which is why this move ranks a bit lower.",

      "",
      "36) Marc Roca (Leeds)\nStruggled whenever he didn’t have Tyler Adams next to him and could not adapt to the physicality of Our League. Roca is decent enough on the ball and probably did just about enough to justify the £8m Leeds paid to sign him.",

      "",
      "22) Marcel Sabitzer (Manchester United)\nSigned on loan for the second half of 22/23, Sabitzer filled a gap for Erik ten Hag and barely put a foot wrong. His form at Borussia Dortmund and for Austria at Euro 2024 will have been hard for Man Utd to stomach. They could have had him for £15m!",

      "Niakhate was pretty solid for Forest but not a £27m player, we don’t think. That is what they got for him from Lyon, making it £47m in total for him and Mangala. Good going, that. Especially when you consider Niakhate only cost Forest around £8m.",

      "",
      "17) Kevin Schade (Brentford)\nBrentford paid around £20m to sign the 23-year-old from Freiburg and after a difficult spell with injuries, Schade has kicked on. He recorded 11 goals and two assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "",
      "16) Demarai Gray (Everton)\nEverton got Gray for a measly £1.5m and he did not live up to that price tag. In a good way, this time.",
      "",
      "15) Kai Havertz (Chelsea)\nStruggled when he joined, then scored the winning goal in a Champions League final, became even worse, but left for £65m. That goal and the fact Chelsea recouped the vast majority of the £72m for Havertz sees him as high as 15th.",

      "Awoniyi proved me wrong, scoring a very respectable 10 in 27. Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",
      "Those goals are the reason why Forest will play in Europe next season and not the Championship.",
      "",
      "10) Maxence Lacroix (Crystal Palace)\nReplacing Joachim Andersen was always going to be difficult but Palace have done exceptionally well with Lacroix. He makes losing Marc Guehi a little less scary.",

      "9) Thiago (Liverpool)\nThiago was an outstanding technician and has decided to call it a day on his playing career last summer after another year riddled with injuries.",
      "Despite his fitness issues, Thiago was still a good signing; especially considering the Reds only paid £20m to sign him from Bayern Munich.",
      "",
      "8) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nNobody really expected much from Akanji when he joined from Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund but he quickly proved he is a top player.",
      "The Swiss international has played superbly as a central defender and even more impressively as a full-back.",
      "",
      "7) Micky van de Ven (Tottenham)\nVan de Ven’s pace is frightening. He can defend as well, which helps. Those hamstrings though…",
      "",
      "6) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nIt’s early days, but Marmoush looks like a very special player.",
      "",
      "5) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta cost close to £10m in January 2022 and took a while to get going, but when he did, bloody hell, he has been difficult to stop.",
      "He is loving life under Oliver Glasner, finishing the 23/24 season with 16 league goals after scoring two in his first 19 appearances in 22/23 and eight in 77 in total. He then bagged 14 in 24/25 and helped Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "4) Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool)\nLike Thiago, Konate does have his injury troubles. Nevertheless, when he is fit Konate forms a terrific partnership with Virgil van Dijk. £36m = bargain.",
      "",
      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City)\nBig, big money for Gvardiol (£77m) but he will be worth it in the long run.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nCity should do business with Dortmund more often. Akanji has been excellent, Ilkay Gundogan’s £21m move in 2016 turned out to be one of the best signings in the club’s history, and Haaland has been…ridiculously impressive.",
      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",
      "He now has one of the biggest contracts in world football after City tied him down for 115 months. Cheeky.",

      "And now TBR Football claim that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",

      "Liverpool are said to be ‘accelerating’ a move for Real Madrid star Rodrygo to replace Luis Diaz amid widely reported interest from Arsenal, less widely reported interest from Manchester City and presumed interest from Chelsea, because it’s Chelsea and they want all the forwards.",
      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",
      "“We try to be closer when things go bad. I did not blame him for being there. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it is already night at 14:00 p.m. in the afternoon.'”",
      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "Liverpool have held ‘no talks’ over a move for Real Madrid star Rodrygo, who is ‘not viewed as a possible replacement’ for Luis Diaz in a huge boost for Arsenal.",
      "Sky Sport Germany’s Florian Plettenberg has clarified whether Rodrygo is a target for Tottenham amid interest from Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Real Madrid have launched an incredible bid to sign Man City midfielder Rodri by offering two players and €40m (£35m), according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly ‘closely monitoring’ a Real Madrid superstar for a ‘very expensive’ transfer as a replacement for Luis Diaz, who looks to be leaving.",
      "Liverpool have now reportedly ‘opened talks’ with Arsenal’s ‘dream’ as sporting director Richard Hughes ‘pushes’ to seal their seventh signing after Ekitike."

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "13) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "15) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "16) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "17) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "18) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "19) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",

      "20) Diego Costa – £57m/€65m (Chelsea to Atletico Madrid, December 2017)\nProof that Chelsea used to be incredible at this transfer lark: they signed Liverpool target Diego Costa from Atletico for £32m in 2014 and built two title-winning teams around his 20-goal seasons, before Antonio Conte dumped the Spain international over text and theoretically torched his valuation by publicly ostracising him, yet Atletico – serving a transfer ban – bought the 29-year-old back for £25m more than they sold him despite Costa not having played for months. And in a miserable second Atleti spell, he scored 19 goals in 81 games, moving to Brazil for free before they won the title.",

      "8) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",

      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "The Portugal international endured a frustrating debut season in Germany, making only six Bundesliga starts for the title winners and watching on as others took precedence in Vincent Kompany’s midfield.",
      "His move from Fulham last summer came after a collapsed deadline-day switch the previous year, and while the eventual £46.5million deal got over the line, the fit never quite did.",
      "Palhinha recently admitted his first year in Bavaria had been “difficult” during tentative links to Arsenal, though he reaffirmed his commitment to return for pre-season and prove himself.",
      "Man Utd are allegedly one of the clubs considering a move. New boss Ruben Amorim worked with Palhinha during their time together at Sporting and Braga, and reports suggest the 30-year-old is being lined up to provide a defensive anchor that would allow Bruno Fernandes more attacking freedom.",

      "10) Lois Openda (Leipzig)\nAfter missing out on Champions League football, Leipzig are expected to make two or three important sales this summer. The best available attacking midfielder and Chelsea target, Xavi Simons, is the most likely as things stand, and Openda could follow his teammate out the door.",
      "After scoring 21 goals in 38 Ligue 1 matches in 2022/23, Openda earned a well-deserved transfer to the Bundesliga, and 24 goals and seven assists in his maiden campaign was a very promising return.",
      "Last season was less convincing from the Belgian, and every other Leipzig player. Still, nine goals and nine assists is hardly rubbish.",
      "With Leipzig open to selling a key player or two, there should be some clubs keen on signing Openda.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",

      "7) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "6) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Blues signing Joao Pedro and Liverpool-bound youngster Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "5) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "4) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",

      "Lazio picked him up from Real Madrid for around £5million in July 2022, and he’s gone on to play 84 times for the Italian giants, scoring two goals.",

      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t quite triggered a transfer domino effect in the Premier League, though the Premier League champions have ramped up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi.

      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",

One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",

      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes on April Fool’s Day, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently, that’s the world we live in now.",

Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often…for my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t lure Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",

Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",

Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",

      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option with another French ex-Leipzig defender, Ibrahima Konate, being fiercely linked with Real Madrid.",

      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",

      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa Conference League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "We also have the best available strikers, attacking midfielders, wingers, and central defenders.",
      "",
      "10) Ardon Jashari (Club Brugge)\nA transfer to AC Milan appears likely, though the Italian side has yet to agree a fee with Club Brugge for the 22-year-old midfielder. Jashari has made it clear that Milan is his preferred destination, but if negotiations with the Belgian club continue to stall, a move elsewhere can’t be ruled out. Given his stance, playing for Brugge again seems unlikely.",
      "Since making his international debut in September 2022, Jashari has earned four caps and is expected to play a more significant role for his national team once Granit Xhaka retires from international football.",
      "He’s a fantastic, young defensive midfielder with Champions League experience, having helped Brugge reach the last 16 of Europe’s premier competition last season. They lost to Aston Villa after an incredible 5-2 aggregate win over Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-off round.",
      "",
      "9) Angelo Stiller (Stuttgart)\nIt’s unlikely that Stiller leaves Stuttgart this summer, but as a standout performer outside of the Champions League spotlight, he could be tempted by a bigger move.",
      "The 24-year-old four-cap Germany international signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that ‘several clubs’ wanted to sign him in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valued at €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, Stiller played 47 times across all competitions last season, assisting an impressive 11 times from defensive midfield.",
      "",
      "8) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from the Premier League. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "7) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 24 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract in May.",
      "That alone makes him pretty unlikely to move this summer.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Gyokeres deal imminent; Simons in, Jackson out at Chelsea\n👉 Mbeumo has taken one of the biggest steps down in transfer history – but No.1 might never be beaten\n👉 Xhaka next? The most stunning transfer coups made by newly-promoted Premier League clubs",
      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away (to other Bayern players, obviously) from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "5) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, having forced a transfer to Arsenal, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 26, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer involving a bit of Italian culture could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",
      "",
      "3) Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nExpect to see a wave of Chelsea players spending time at Strasbourg, as Todd Boehly continues to treat the French club as his very own Vitesse.",
      "Santos was one of the most impressive midfielders in Ligue 1 last season and was the only returning loanee Enzo Maresca included in Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad, with Strasbourg team-mate Djordje Petrovic missing out and eventually moving to Bournemouth.",
      "Despite his huge ceiling, Chelsea seem happy to sell him to fund the next phase of their transfer binge, even if his replacement is worse and has less potential. Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and need a bit more midfield depth following the exits of Jorginho and an unnamed Premier League footballer in his 30s.",
      "",
      "2) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80m, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Atalanta)\nThere’s a good chance Ederson ends up in Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal reportedly keen to sign him from Atalanta.",
      "The Saudi Arabian side have struggled to convince their top targets to join this summer and consistent snubs mean his name is rising on their shortlist.",
      "The 26-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",
      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him."

      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "Clubs agree initial loan deal for Marcus Rashford with option for Barca to buy him next summer; Rashford flew into Barcelona on Sunday and an official unveiling is expected on Wednesday; Rashford will still have two years left on his United deal when this proposed loan move ends",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford is understood to have completed his Barcelona medical this morning.",
      "The 27-year-old flew into the city on Sunday from the northwest and an official unveiling is expected on Wednesday.",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "The England international has publicly said he would like to play for Barcelona.",
      "The move for Rashford is understood to have been given the green light by head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "Rashford's priority has been a move to Barcelona, who stepped up their interest after failing with Nico Williams or Luis Diaz. He will still have two years left on his United deal when this proposed loan move ends.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort. His No 10 shirt at Old Trafford was handed to new summer signing, Matheus Cunha, earlier this month.",
      "Teddy Sheringham does not believe Manchester United forward Rashford deserves to join Barcelona after what he feels has been a \"soul-destroying\" episode.",
      "\"If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you're there, you appreciate it,\" the ex-United player told Sky Bet. \"You don't throw it away and say you want to leave.",
      "\"I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out - I didn't like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn't get the move that he's hankering for.",
      "\"From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that's a step up that he hasn't deserved.\"",

      "Chelsea value Nicolas Jackson at between £80m and £100m, with Manchester United among Premier League clubs keeping an eye on him.",
      "The 24-year-old is also subject to interest from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia; however, Chelsea are under no pressure to sell as he has eight years left on his contract.",

      "Promising starts from new signings, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, who both play in Jackson's position, meant his involvement in the competition wore thin as his side progressed to the final.",
      "Any incomings at Chelsea continue to be exit-dependent. Chelsea would ideally like to start the season with three high-quality players who can play in the No 9 role.",
      "With the additions of Delap and Pedro, if Jackson were to leave, they may sign a wide player instead of another No 9 because Pedro Neto can also play through the middle.",
      "Xavi Simons, Alejandro Garnacho, Morgan Rogers and Kenan Yildiz are some of the players Chelsea are currently looking at."

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim to MUTV:",
      "\"It was a pre-season game. The distances between the sectors were really big sometimes. We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high, they kicked the ball high and won the second balls. They were dangerous in those moments.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",
      "\"We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
      "Leeds manager Daniel Farke has announced that Patrick Bamford is no longer in his plans for next season.",
      "Farke said on Bamford's future: \"I had an honest communication with him.",
      "\"For me, at this stage he needs to be the main man, he needs the backing, the arm around the shoulder after difficult years to rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"After the last two seasons, I wasn't willing to take him on right now as the main man in the Premier League.\"",
