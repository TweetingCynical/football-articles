      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits he wished he could go back to the Champions League semi-final in 2002 to score a goal so that he could \"shut up Roy Keane\" - who still gives him grief for his miss.",
      "For all Manchester United's dominance of the Premier League, players speak of several missed opportunities on the European stage with Sir Alex Ferguson claiming victory just twice across a period of success that spanned 30 years.",
      "One of the teams to oust them in the Champions League was Bayer Leverkusen, who made it all the way to the final that year. They downed United by virtue of away goals before losing to Real Madrid.",
      "They had drawn the first leg at Old Trafford 2-2 with Oliver Neuville scoring a late equaliser for the Germans, so United knew they were at an immediate disadvantage as they headed for the away leg. In Leverkusen they could only draw 1-1, Keane scoring for the Red Devils, but it wasn't enough.",
      "Diego Forlan saw an effort cleared off the line and shortly after Solskjaer was found in the box by Ryan Giggs, but the Norwegian rushed his chance and fired the bouncing ball over the crossbar from close range - something Keane still gives him grief for.",
      "Solskjaer told the BBC: \"There's one game I would love to play again and score a goal and shut Roy Keane up. So Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League semi-final. Every time I meet Roy, he mentions this chance that I missed. The ball is just behind me, its a half-volley, I hit it just over the bar and we lose on away goals. So every time I see Roy he mentions that one. So that's the one to change the history.\"",
      "United would finish that season trophyless as they were left to bemoan another Champions League chance that has passed them by. Even recently Keane was still referencing Solskjaer's miss.",
      "Speaking on Stick to Football the Irishman admits the miss still plagues his memories. He said: “I know you have to move on, but Bayer Leverkusen – I can still see Ole’s chance in that game. I bring it up when I see him now, I still mention the chance he missed! Forget how brilliant he was – I went, ‘f***ing hit the target!’”",
      "Solskjaer does have his name etched into United history books having scored the goal which won the Champions League in 1999. He appeared off the bench as United scored twice in the last two minutes to stun Bayern Munich in the Nou Camp.",

      "Marcus Rashford has finally seen his wish of playing at the Camp Nou for Barcelona granted. The England international appeared for the La Liga giants as a second-half substitute on Saturday against Alaves.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United forward had previously spoken of his desire to play in front of Barcelona fans at their iconic home ground, given Camp Nou has been undergoing £1.3billion redevelopment works and the Catalan titans had been unable to compete there as a result. Shortly after completing his move, Rashford said: \"It's a very nice feeling.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in.\"",
      "He added: \"But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "As a result of the redevelopment, Hansi Flick's side played their matches at the Olympic Stadium at the start of the season. However, that all changed last weekend, when the club was granted permission to re-open the Camp Nou for their 4-0 win over Athletic Club, albeit, at a limited capacity of around 45,000.",
      "Unfortunately for Rashford, however, he had to miss the homecoming game as a result of illness, instead watching from the side-lines. But the 28-year-old finally saw his dream come true on Saturday afternoon, gracing the hallowed turf of the iconic venue as a second-half substitute against Alaves in La Liga.",
      "Rashford replaced Marc Bernal at half-time during the match, which Barcelona achieved a 3-1 win in thanks to a goal from teenage wonderkid, Lamine Yamal, and a Dani Olmo brace. Since joining Barca, Rashford has managed six goals and nine assists from 17 appearances, as he looks to impress at his new club.",
      "Barcelona also have the option to make his move permanent next summer for a reported £26million, and they seem more likely than not to do so, given his impressive form as of late. The redevelopment of Camp Nou is set to be complete in 2027.",
      "The capacity of the stadium will then officially expand to 105,000, making it the fifth-biggest stadium in the world. The La Liga table toppers have also lodged an application with UEFA to request permission to move their remaining Champions League home games to the stadium.",
      "Up next for Barca is a home clash with Atletico Madrid come Tuesday, December 2, before they face Real Betis away four days later. Their next Champions League contest falls on Tuesday, December 9, when they face Eintracht Frankfurt on home soil.",

      "Valverde's Real future is in serious doubt following a bust-up with manager Xabi Alonso, with Uruguayan international one of several Real players said to be unhappy with Alonso's management style. Valverde is under contract until 2029, but is considering leaving the Spanish giants unless his relationship with Alonso improves. United are one of several clubs keeping close tabs on the situation.",

      "United value the 27-year-old closer to the £70m mark - and the two clubs remain a long way apart in their valuation of Valverde. United have a troubled relationship with Real when it comes to the transfer market.",
      "David De Gea's move to Real dramatically collapsed in 2015 - leaving both clubs blaming each other. While Sir Alex Ferguson, who was left devastated when Real signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009, once said he wouldn't sell Real \"a virus\".",
      "Alonso has also been seen clashing with Vinicius Jnr during the opening months of his spell at the Bernabeu, which comes at a time when the Brazilian is in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Despite all the politics the player turned manager insists nothing has surprised him about the Real job despite its demands. He said: “It’s turning out to be what I expected, a very demanding job. With moments when you need concentration, others when you need to react quickly. But I’m enjoying everything, the whole package that it entails.",

      "Roma bosses, though, value Zirkzee closer to the £20m mark. Holland forward Zirkzee is desperate to find an escape route from Old Trafford, in a bid to boost his hopes of being involved in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Zirkzee has failed to make an impact at United, scoring just three goals in 37 league appearances. The 24-year-old wants to reignite his career, elsewhere and knows Roma could secure a place in the Champions League for next season.",
      "Zirkzee was handed a rare chance to impress in Monday night's chastening 1-0 home defeat against Everton with Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha sidelined. But he failed to make the most of it, with his performance leaving former Red Devils striker Michael Owen questioning if Zirkzee is the right for what Amorim wants his frontman to do.",
      "“I can’t watch him and get excited, I must admit,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Cunha missing today was a big blow. He was the closest to scoring for Man United but they are almost resorting to playing like this with hopeful crosses because he’s in there.",
      "“If you have Cunha playing, a different profile of player, you probably don’t go knocking crosses in all game. It’s not how Manchester United want to play and I always think if you start lumping the ball it becomes desperation.",

      "Manchester United youngster JJ Gabriel mimicked Alexander Isak's trademark celebration after netting a hat-trick in a stunning 7-0 thrashing of Liverpool's under-18s. The 15-year-old sensation struck three times as United's youth team demolished their Merseyside rivals away from home.",
      "His standout strike came via a mesmerising solo run down the right flank, weaving past several Liverpool defenders before rifling the ball into the net. The teenager then wheeled away pointing back over his shoulder - exactly replicating Isak's signature move after finding the back of the net.",
      "The Swedish striker hasn't showcased that particular celebration recently, but it became rather notable when he produced it after outjumping Virgil van Dijk to score in Newcastle's Carabao Cup victory over Liverpool. Gabriel had certainly earned the right to mock his opponents after completing his treble, taking his tally to 10 goals this season.",
      "Darren Fletcher's squad climbed to third place following that emphatic win, ending a disappointing run of five matches without victory. Despite Gabriel's tender years, Ruben Amorim is well aware of the youngster's talents, having witnessed them first hand during senior training sessions last month.",
      "Amorim said: \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy. We try to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty and pace of our training.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Gabriel could soon find himself in senior matchday squads given his talent, though United are likely to be cautious with his development. If he was just a few years older, it is very possible a first-team debut would have arrived already.",
      "Both Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will soon be heading to AFCON while Benjamin Sesko is out injured for the next few weeks. Matheus Cunha also missed Monday's defeat to Everton after suffering an issue in training, but he is expected back for next week's clash against West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "As a result of those two enforced absences, forgotten star Joshua Zirkzee started and played the full game against Everton while Shea Lacey was also on the bench. The latter is another youngster from the academy that is very highly-rated.",
      "From eight appearances for the under-21s, across Premier League 2 and the EFL Trophy, he has contributed to five goals. The 18-year-old is another young attacker that Amorim has commented on.",
      "\"I'm really happy with him,\" he said before the Everton clash. \"He struggled a little bit with injuries but they did a very good job balancing his body and you can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard.",
      "\"In Premier League games the pressure is harder, so they need to be ready. When you call a kid up to the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are putting everything in place - a nutritionist for the academy starts now - in our club.",
      "\"That is something that should be basic. All these things we are doing, so I have more time with them and I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids in to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think.\"",

The Toffees managed to leave Old Trafford with all three points despite being a man down and the former player didn't hold back. He said: \"We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team. The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so.",

      "Manchester United's transfer wishlist was sensationally leaked in 2004 - and remarkably, the club went on to sign most of the names on it. At the time, the Red Devils were heading into arguably the toughest patch of Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League tenure.",
      "They'd just surrendered the title to Arsenal's Invincibles and would spend the next two years fruitlessly chasing down Jose Mourinho's Chelsea. But Ferguson's meticulous squad-planning eventually helped turn the tide - even if part it was leaked to the public.",
      "The leak came in the form of a fascinating photo of a club document titled Player Analysis. It divided the United squad into four columns: squad, excess, youth potential and transfer targets.",
      "Established players such as Nicky Butt and Diego Forlan appeared in the excess column, signalling they were likely to be moved on. Meanwhile, academy prospects like Kieran Richardson, Tom Heaton and Phil Bardsley were listed under youth potential, evidence that they were being groomed for future roles in the first team.",
      "But the most intriguing section was the transfer targets column, which included then-Barcelona academy star Gerard Pique, PSG full-back Gabriel Heinze and Leeds striker Alan Smith - all of whom would go on to join United that summer. Two notable names, however, slipped through the net.",
      "One was Vincent Kompany, then an emerging teenage star at Anderlecht and a future Manchester City captain. The other was Auxerre defender Philippe Mexes, who later played for Roma and AC Milan.",
      "The document offered an intriguing window into United's Ferguson-era recruitment strategy - and the brilliance of their scouting network. Pique, Heinze, Kompany and Mexes were largely unknown in 2004, yet each would go on to forge successful careers at the highest level.",
      "Pique's Old Trafford career, however, never truly took off. The young Spaniard struggled for game time behind the formidable Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, eventually returning to Barcelona. There, he became one of the modern game's greatest central defenders, anchoring a period of dominance at the Nou Camp that included nine La Liga titles, three Champions League trophies and seven Copa del Rey wins.",
      "Heinze enjoyed a solid three-year spell at United, but a lengthy injury in 2006 prompted the club to sign Patrice Evra, who would soon supplant him as first-choice left-back. Heinze departed in 2007, moving on to Real Madrid.",
      "Meanwhile, Smith started brightly at Old Trafford but was hampered by persistent injuries, eventually leaving for Newcastle in 2007.",
      "Perhaps the most significant acquisition of the summer, though absent from the leaked wishlist, was Wayne Rooney. United secured the striker from Everton for £27million - a record for a teenager at the time.",
      "Rooney would, of course, go on to become the club's all-time leading scorer with 253 goals and eventually captain the team, cementing his place as a Red Devils legend.",
      "As for the players on the excess list, all five were offloaded that very summer. Butt was sold to Newcastle, Forlan to Villarreal and Luke Chadwick to West Ham. Ricardo was released on a free, while Michael Stewart was loaned to Hearts before leaving the following year permanently.",
      "In hindsight, United largely made the right calls. That said, a case can be made that letting Forlan go was a misstep. The Uruguayan had struggled during his two-and-a-half years at Old Trafford, famously failing to score in his first season. Yet once he left, he finally fulfilled the potential United had glimpsed when they signed him from Independiente.",
      "After scoring just 17 times in 98 appearances for United, Forlan netted 25 goals in his first season at Villarreal. Following three prolific seasons there, he moved to Atletico Madrid and went on to score 96 goals in 198 matches.",
      "United didn't exactly suffer in his absence - with the likes of Rooney, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov all firing consistently - but Forlan's later success highlights one of the rare miscalculations in a transfer market record that had few major blots.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Darts sensation Luke Littler has urged Manchester United to snap up Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo. After the forward followed the Nuke on social media, the teenage sensation joked it's now up to Old Trafford's recruitment team to seal the deal.",
      "The Nuke has called on United to activate the 25-year-old's release clause, believed to be around £65 million, this January. The suggestion comes as boss Ruben Amorim faces a selection crisis, with both Amad (Ivory Coast) and Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon) preparing to link up with their nations for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco next month.",
      "Morocco's Noussair Mazraoui will also be required for tournament duty, with regulations requiring clubs to release players a fortnight before their opening fixtures. That means the trio could depart around the time of their Molineux clash against Wolves on December 8, though reports indicate the club are attempting to postpone their departures.",
      "Littler took to Instagram with a string of stories about potentially losing Amad and Mbeumo. The 18-year-old shared a clip headlined 'The solution to our AFCON worries?', featuring footage of the United duo celebrating before cutting to highlights of Semenyo's strikes.",
      "The darts ace wrote: \"Activate the release clause [wink emoji] gonna miss Amad and Mbeumo massively.\"",
      "He shared a screenshot of his notifications on social media, showing that Semenyo appeared to have followed him. He captioned the post: \"Step one [tick emoji] I've done my job, now it's down to you Reds [wink and laughing emoji].\"",
      "Rumours are swirling that Semenyo – who is also on Liverpool's radar – is being eyed as a potential transfer target for United. The Athletic has reported that Bournemouth have 'reluctantly accepted' they may need to sell the 25-year-old in the upcoming January transfer window.",
      "Semenyo, who committed to the Cherries until 2030 in the summer, reportedly has a £65m release clause in his contract, but there is a time limit to allow Bournemouth to secure a suitable replacement.",
      "With the January transfer window just around the corner, Littler's demands come amid fears of losing key players from Amorim's squad until mid-January.",
      "As things stand, those called up for AFCON action could miss matches against Newcastle United (26th December) and Wolves (30th December), and potentially earlier games against Bournemouth and Aston Villa on 15th and 21st December respectively.",
      "Depending on how far Ivory Coast and Cameroon progress, they could also be absent for matches against Leeds, Burnley, the FA Cup third round and the Manchester derby against City on 17th December.",
      "Amorim confirmed earlier this month that talks would be held with the relevant football federations.",
      "He stated: \"We have the rules for when we have to release the players [but] we are trying to have the players a bit longer.",
      "\"It is not just in our hands. We will see. We will try to arrange something with the federations.\"",

      "Teenage sensation Cristian Orozco has posted a heartfelt message before jetting off to the UK for a visit to Manchester United - describing the opportunity as a 'dream' come true. The Red Devils have struck a preliminary deal to snap up the Colombian starlet from Fortaleza CEIF, although the transfer cannot be officially completed until next year when he reaches 18.",
      "Orozco will remain with Fortaleza CEIF until the switch can be rubber-stamped in July. However, the promising midfielder will make the trip to Manchester to get acquainted with his future surroundings and will be given tours of both Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "On Friday, Orozco posted on Instagram, sharing a snap at the airport with scout Giuseppe Antonaccio and the message: \"With the great Giuseppe, on the way to a dream.\"",
      "United have broadened their youth recruitment strategy in recent years following post-Brexit rules, which limit clubs' ability to bring in players from Europe.",
      "The deal to secure Orozco from Fortaleza is understood to be valued at approximately $1million (£750,000). Last summer, United brought in Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno in a transfer worth £3.3million, potentially rising to £7m with performance-related clauses.",
      "Leon made a strong impression on coaching staff at Carrington and trained solely with the senior squad during pre-season preparations.",
      "United's captures of Orozco and Leon follow co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's declaration that he prefers investing in emerging talent rather than splashing out on established stars. \"I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,\" the club's co-owner said.",
      "\"It's not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Jude Bellingham or next Roy Keane.",
      "\"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They have done that, if you look at the last ten years, they have spent a lot of money on a couple of great players.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club. And make sure we get recruitment right, it is such a vital part of football today.\"",
      "United brought in five players during the summer window, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all arriving at Old Trafford. The summer spending spree set the club back £236m.",

      "Patrick Dorgu faces a one-match Premier League ban if he receives one more booking. The news comes after the defender apparently 'liked' a social media post ridiculing Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Dane's Instagram account interacted with a post criticising Amorim's use of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in a midfield pivot. The post, shared by 'mufcunion', contained a comment from X that read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The caption of the Instagram post said: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and was 'liked' by the 21-year-old left-back's account. Dorgu has his own problems to handle as he will have to be careful against Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "If the left-back receives a yellow card against the Eagles, then he will miss out on United's home fixture against West Ham on Thursday, December 4.",
      "Amorim has yet to speak on Dorgu's online actions, but many would argue he also has bigger fish to fry in terms of United's current run of form. The club are currently sat in 10th place after dropping down the league table due to a few poor results.",
      "United had been on a big upswing earlier in the season, beating the likes of Liverpool, Brighton and Sunderland to maintain a winning streak. However, draws against Tottenham and Nottingham Forest saw this form stumble and eventually nosedive after their 1-0 loss to Everton.",
      "Despite Idrissa Gueye being sent off in the 13th minute for an altercation with his own team-mate, Michael Keane, United couldn't capitalise on the one-man advantage and went down to a 29th-minute strike from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "Now, a new challenge awaits in fifth-placed Palace, and United need to be at their best against last year's FA Cup winners.",
      "With the Red Devils fully focused on domestic football, given that they didn't qualify for any European competition this season, Amorim needs all his players available so he can concentrate on pushing the club back up the table.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Palace match, Amorim said: \"They are a different club [to us] and they are doing things better than us so that is quite simple.",
      "\"We play in a different way and they are just doing things better than us. They are doing things really well and they play more in transition than us. We have to look at all of these things when we compare our teams but of course, in every position, we can do so much better.\"",
      "When asked if his team hold an advantage given their lack of European football, the Portuguese boss said: \"I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe and I say the same thing this year: there [is an] advantage and disadvantage of not being in Europe. There are no excuses. We have to always win games.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has reached out to Manchester United supporters on social media to express his gratitude for their backing while he recovers from injury. The Brazilian striker is currently sidelined after picking up a knock during training last week.",
      "The setback meant he was unavailable for the Everton defeat and will also rule him out of Sunday's encounter with Crystal Palace. \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham on Thursday], not this one,\" Reds boss Ruben Amorim confirmed during Friday's press conference.",
      "That evening, Cunha posted on Instagram with an image of himself working out on an exercise bike, writing: \"Thank you all for the messages, I haven't gone crazy yet. Despite the joke, thank you for your concern. Much love.\"",
      "Cunha, who sealed a £62.5million switch from Wolves during the summer transfer window, has made a strong impression at Old Trafford and his absence has been keenly felt. News of his injury first emerged when the 26 year old was forced to miss a Christmas lights switch-on event in Altrincham.",
      "\"Unfortunately Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" @VisitAltrincham posted on social media a week ago.",
      "Alongside Cunha, Benjamin Sesko continues to be out of action with a knee problem. Amorim indicated at last week's press conference that he anticipates Sesko returning to fitness before the Wolves fixture on December 8, though he acknowledged the forward might require additional recovery time.",
      "Meanwhile, United's skipper Harry Maguire will continue to be sidelined due to a thigh problem. \"It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him. Harry, the same,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "The Red Devils will be back on the pitch this Sunday at Palace (12pm), aiming to recover from their defeat against Everton. Before that setback, Amorim's squad had enjoyed a five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.",

      "Despite his impressive performances for the Under-18s and making the step up in training, Gabriel won't be able to make his first-team debut until January at the earliest.",

      "Ryan Giggs was proved right that Marcus Rashford is once again enjoying his football after leaving Manchester United. The 28-year-old last played for his boyhood club in December 2024 before he was banished from the first-team by Ruben Amorim just a month after the Portuguese manager's arrival.",
      "A loan move to Aston Villa was green-lit in the January transfer window. While his form did improve at Villa Park, which resulted in him being called up to Thomas Tuchel's first England squad, Unai Emery opted against making his temporary stay a permanent one.",
      "Although he returned to Old Trafford in the summer, it didn't last long as he secured a season-long loan to Barcelona. The forward has looked like the Rashford of old in Spain with 15 goals and assists in 17 games across all competitions so far.",
      "A move away from Manchester was one Rashford revealed he needed last year and Giggs admitted the choice to depart the Red Devils was the correct choice for him. The United legend, who turns 52 today, served as Louis van Gaal's assistant when Rashford made his United debut at the age of 18, back in 2016.",
      "The Welshman had a front-row seat as Rashford netted a brace on his full debut in a 5-1 home victory over FC Midtjylland in the Europa League. It was during Giggs' appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast earlier this year that he said a return to United is not on the cards for Rashford when asked if the possibility remained.",
      "\"No. I don't think he looked happy at United,\" Giggs told his former team-mate. \"I think he looks happier now. I just don't. Which is a shame because obviously I'd seen him as a part of the staff when we'd given him his debut.\"",
      "Questioned on what he'd tell Rashford if he was working under Amorim, the former United captain called out the forward's work ethic and said the club's fanbase will not accept a player giving less than his all.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"First of all, he's got to work harder,\" Giggs said. \"I talked about no matter what position on the pitch you are, you sprint back as quick as you sprint forward, and aesthetically, it didn't look great. Especially if the team ain't doing well.",
      "\"Because fans will forgive you for missing a chance. They won't forgive you for not working hard enough. They just won't. Because they can do that. They can sprint. Everyone can. But then also, what I talked about, you know that he can play up there.",
      "\"He's done it everywhere. He's done it on the biggest stage. It's hard from looking outside to in. But it looked like he's not enjoying it. And you've got to enjoy it. Especially flare players, attacking players.",

      "Ryan Giggs was once fined two weeks wages for snapping back at Sir Alex Ferguson. The former Manchester United winger admits the intimidating manager may have punished talking back, but he actually preferred his players to have some bite about them in the dressing room.",
      "The 52-year-old spent over 20 years with the club, making 963 appearances, scoring 168 goals and assisting 271 times. The Red Devils icon won all there is to win in club football, including two Champions Leagues and a whopping 13 Premier League titles.",
      "However, Giggs was once a rising star at the club and faced off with Fergie on a few tense occasions. Speaking to beIN SPORTS's The Champions Club in 2020, he said: \"There was definitely fear, especially early on.",
      "\"He mellowed a little bit as he got older, but not a lot. Definitely early on, especially as a young player, he had this cough that you could hear. And if you heard that at our first training ground at The Cliff, you would very often turn the other way.",
      "\"You just didn't want to cross him at 18, 19, 20 because you never knew what sort of mood he was in. So there was definitely that fear but ultimately there was always that respect, whether he had a go at you or you just fell out with him.\"",
      "Reflecting on times he got on the wrong side of Ferguson, Giggs said: \"I fell out with him plenty of times. I mean the amount of times I would say over my career, six or seven times where it was a couple of weeks wages I was fined for talking back, for having an argument.",
      "\"At the time it's not very nice, you're in the dressing room, you've just got beat or you've had a bad performance. And I just couldn't help myself have a go back.\"",

      "Former Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs is leading a vastly different life from his glory days at Old Trafford. The Red Devils legend turns 52 on Saturday and finds himself out of the game.",
      "The ex-United winger, who clinched an unprecedented 13 Premier League titles, left his position as Salford City's director of football in September, seemingly with ambitions of getting back into management. Giggs has not overseen a side since standing down as Wales manager in 2022 after being arrested on suspicion of assault.",
      "Giggs consistently denied allegations of assault and controlling or coercive behaviour towards his former partner Kate Greville and assaulting her sibling Emma. He was cleared after the Crown Prosecution Service dropped all charges before a planned retrial in 2023.",
      "While Giggs found a path back into the sport with Salford City, he received support from his girlfriend Zara Charles during his legal issues. The pair had a child together last year, with Giggs becoming a father again at the age of 50.",
      "Giggs has been romantically involved with lingerie model Zara Charles - who is 15 years younger than the football star - since 2021. The 37-year-old gave birth to their daughter Cora last November.",
      "A spokesperson for the former United icon said at the time: \"Ryan and his partner Zara are delighted to announce the birth of their daughter, Cora Giggs, who was born on Friday, November 1",
      "\"They extend their warmest gratitude to all the amazing staff, especially the midwives, at Wythenshawe Hospital.\"",
      "The surprise arrival marked Giggs' third child. He was already a father to Libby and Zach from his marriage to Stacey Cooke.",
      "The footballer found himself at the centre of a public controversy during his playing career when it emerged that he had been involved in an eight-year relationship with Natasha, the wife of his brother Rhodri. The revelation resulted in Rhodri and Natasha's marriage ending.",
      "Yet more than a decade later, it seems Rhodri still appreciates his brother's accomplishments on the pitch. The United legend secured 13 Premier League titles throughout his illustrious career and remains the competition's all-time leader in assists.",
      "Despite this, he remains absent from the Premier League Hall of Fame. Rhodri expressed frustration with his brother's omission from this year's shortlist. Giggs' former teammate Gary Neville has since become the most recent United legend to enter the prestigious 26-member group.",
      "Taking to social media, Rhodri wrote: \"13 Premier League medals, countless goals, and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "When questioned about his current relationship with his brother following the affair controversy, Rhodri told one social media user: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He added: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "Giggs has previously made clear his ambitions to get back into football management. The 52-year-old cut his coaching teeth at United, serving as caretaker boss and assistant manager, before taking charge of Wales in 2018.",
      "While his recent spell as director of football at Salford maintained his connection to the game, Giggs acknowledged his desire to return to the touchline. When asked last year about a managerial comeback, Giggs said: \"I loved managing Wales, obviously. I do miss it, so hopefully.\"",
      "Giggs was spotted working with Salford boss Karl Robinson throughout his time at the club. The United icon had been a co-owner at Salford until a recent takeover in May.",

      "Rhodri Giggs has put his notorious history with Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs firmly behind him. The younger sibling recently defended Ryan after he was left off the Premier League's Hall of Fame shortlist earlier this year.",
      "United icon Giggs, who turns 52 today, won a record 13 Premier League titles throughout his career and leads the competition's all-time list for assists. Yet Giggs' achievements have gone unrecognised by the Hall of Fame following a series of personal controversies.",
      "One scandal that surfaced while he was still playing involved Ryan's eight-year relationship with his brother Rhodri's wife, Natasha. The affair resulted in Rhodri and Natasha's marriage ending and fundamentally altered the family's relationships. Despite this, Rhodri has shown that he still respects his brother's accomplishments in a United jersey.",
      "In September, the Premier League announced a shortlist of 15 candidates, with two subsequently gaining Hall of Fame status. The list featured seven of Giggs' former Old Trafford colleagues, with Gary Neville later receiving the honour alongside former Chelsea star Eden Hazard, but Rhodri criticised the Premier League for repeatedly snubbing his brother.",
      "Sharing a compilation of Giggs' United career highlights, Rhodri posted on social media: \"13 Premier League medals and countless goals and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "Despite Ryan's illustrious football career, the Manchester United icon's reputation has been impacted by various off-field scandals. He left his role as Wales manager in 2022 after being arrested on suspicion of assault.",
      "He always denied the accusations and was cleared of all charges after his former partner Kate Greville withdrew from the trial in 2023. He had been serving as Salford City's director of football but departed in September, reportedly with ambitions to get back into management.",
      "Giggs was interim manager and assistant coach at United before taking charge of Wales in 2018. While Ryan looks to make his return to the touchline, Rhodri has stated he holds no grudge towards his elder brother and even profited financially from their dispute.",
      "Responding to a social media user mentioning their history, Rhodri previously commented: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He continued: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "While some might have found it surprising to see Rhodri publicly backing his brother, his objection to the Premier League Hall of Fame does have merit. Giggs' ex-team-mates David Beckham, Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Wayne Rooney, Peter Schmeichel, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Andy Cole had all been recognised previously, along with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "This year, Neville was added to the 26-man Hall of Fame. Other recent nominees with ties to United include Patrice Evra, Teddy Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Michael Owen.",
      "Giggs, a one-club man, made an impressive 963 appearances, netting 168 goals. His illustrious 24-year career saw him lift numerous major trophies, including 13 league titles, four FA Cups and two Champions Leagues.",

      "Manchester United's five-game unbeaten run came to an end on Monday night at Old Trafford. Looking to continue their fine form, Ruben Amorim's side were stopped in their tracks by a solid Everton side who came away with a 1-0 victory, despite being down to 10-men for most of the contest.",
      "As is the case with the strength of the English top-flight, the schedule rarely gets any easier. United next travel to fifth-placed Crystal Palace on Sunday in a bid to return to winning ways.",
      "While United transformed their attack in the summer with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, a midfield signing was not acquired. It wasn't for the lack of trying given the club were interested in Brighton's Carlos Baleba but his reported valuation of £104million meant a deal didn't materialise.",
      "United's engine room is certainly in need of a revamp with Casemiro turning 34 in February and Manuel Ugarte's inability to adapt to the Premier League causing Amorim issues.",
      "According to a Spanish report, via TEAMtalk, the Portuguese boss is \"planning to submit\" a £105m bid for Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde. The 27-year-old has made 341 appearances for the Spanish giants in his eight-year spell at the club which has resulted in him winning 14 major honours.",
      "However, reports have been strife surrounding his unhappiness at Madrid under Xabi Alonso who has played the Uruguayan at right-back since October due to injuries to Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "It hasn't been the best lead-up to the tough fixture against Palace in terms of injuries, with Amorim revealing that Harry Maguire, Cunha and Sesko will miss the match. Sesko, who cost United £74m this past summer, has started just six league games this season and has only two goals to his name.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Slovenian was forced off in their 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur with a knee injury and pulled out of international duty earlier this month. In Friday's pre-match press conference, Amorim said he'll remain without the services of his striker. The United boss said: \"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time, [Harry] Maguire again the same.\"",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system has received much criticism during his time in England, with the manager sticking to his guns. The placement of Luke Shaw as a left centre-back in the defeat to Everton, with Shaw traditionally a left-back, was subject to the ire of Gary Neville who questioned the decision.",
      "The trip to Selhurst Park on Sunday will see a battle of 3-4-3 systems, given Oliver Glasner plays the same formation. Unlike many, the Austrian defended his fellow manager's insistence on the system, admitting it's helped United in attack.",
      "The Palace boss said: \"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals. Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",

      "JJ Gabriel's burgeoning reputation rose even further as the Manchester United wonder kid hit a stunning hat-trick in a 7-0 Under-18 demolition of Liverpool. Gabriel, still only 15, netted two individual efforts in the first half before adding a third after the break as United ran riot.",
      "Bendito Mantato opened the scoring early on with a driven finish before Gabriel then took centre stage. His first was a superb effort where he twisted and turned inside the box to bamboozle the home defence before firing home. And his second was in a similar vein with a powerful finish into the roof of the net to make it three.",
      "Louie Bradbury, returning from injury, netted the fourth while Jim Thwaites converted a penalty to make it five. Liverpool were shellshocked and Samuel Lusale added a sixth before Gabriel crowned his fine afternoon with his third and United's seventh.",
      "Gabriel has been involved in first team training under Ruben Amorim in recent weeks and one of the most highly rated talents to come through the academy. The teenager and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Gabriel has spoken to Amorim, with the United boss discussing his philosophy and stressing the importance of working hard. Omar Berrada (CEO) and Jason Wilcox (director of football) were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and fans have speculated when he could make his senior debut.",
      "The 15-year-old has the potential to become United's youngest-ever Premier League player. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest players to make an appearance for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record held by Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",

      "Heading into Friday's press conference there was hope among Manchester United fans of Matheus Cunha being available for the trip to Crystal Palace. The Brazilian may have only scored once for the Reds so far this season, but he offers a focal point at the top of the attack when playing a strikerless system.",
      "He was missing against Everton, as was Benjamin Sesko, so Ruben Amorim decided to take a chance on Joshua Zirkzee. Sesko has been the first choice for United this season if he wanted a recognised striker up top. If not, Cunha was pushed up and Zirkzee was seen as an afterthought.",
      "That is why his inclusion raised eyebrows and the chance was there for the Dutchman to prove Amorim was right to back him. Instead, we saw why the United boss has been picking Sesko ahead of him all season. It has been said plenty of times before but it is worth repeating - Zirkzee is not a No.9.",
      "His effort for the team cannot be questioned and he did test Jordan Pickford on a couple of occasions with headers. But for the most part, Zirkzee did not offer an outlet for United as James Tarkowski and Michael Keane dealt with him easily.",
      "Amorim could decide to repeat his tactic from Monday night but having seen it not work, the United boss could opt to give another overlooked player in Kobbie Mainoo a chance instead. Mainoo has yet to start a Premier League match for United this season given Amorim's desire to play Bruno Fernandes deeper. What could work to satisfy both midfielders is to play Mainoo alongside Casemiro and allow Fernandes to push up into a No.10 role.",
      "It has been a while since United's captain has played as an attacking midfielder but this is clearly the position where you can get the best out of him. When watching Fernandes, you can see he excels when building attacks and he will receive more opportunities doing that further forward.",
      "You could even play the captain as the false nine but the strongest formation in Amorim's set-up would be to play him as a No.10 and allow Bryan Mbeumo to lead the line. The Cameroonian has done it for Brentford previously so it shouldn't be too big a change for the club's top goalscorer.",
      "With Cunha expected to be fit to play in midweek when West Ham travel to Old Trafford, the opportunity for Mainoo to gain more minutes will slip away until next month when the AFCON players leave.",

      "Teenage wonderkid Cristian Orozco has shared an emotional update before flying to the UK to meet with Manchester United - a move he has already described as a dream. United have a preliminary agreement to sign the Colombian from Fortaleza CEIF, though the move can only be completed next year when he turns 18.",
      "Orozco will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July. In the meantime, the young midfielder will travel to Manchester to familiarise himself with the area ahead of the move and will also be shown around Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "On Friday, Orozco took to Instagram, sharing a picture at the airport with the scout Giuseppe Antonaccio alongside the caption: \"With the great Giuseppe , on the way to a dream.\" United have expanded their academy recruitment in recent years following Brexit regulations, which restrict clubs from signing players from Europe.",
      "The agreement to bring Orozco from Fortaleza is believed to be worth around $1million (£750,000). Last summer, United welcomed Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno in a deal worth £3.3million, rising to £7m with add-ons.",
      "Leon impressed coaches at Carrington and trained exclusively with the first team during pre-season.",
      "United's signings of Orozco and Leon come after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe made it clear that he wants to sign the next superstar rather than an established talent for big money. “I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Jude Bellingham or next Roy Keane.",
      "\"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn’t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players.",

      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club. And make sure we get recruitment right, it is such a vital part of football today.”",
      "United signed five players in the summer with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford. The summer transfer window cost the club £236m.",

      "While Yorke understands the sentimental reasons for some fans not wanting to move, he explained to MEN Sport why he feels the new stadium is essential. \"I think the new stadium will be a welcome one,\" he said as an ambassador for Escapist Magazine.",
      "\"When you look at other teams like Tottenham and [Arsenal] at the Emirates Stadium, United are still the biggest club in English football. In my opinion, they need to go and raise the bar so wherever the new stadium was going to be won't distract players, they still have that profile.",
      "\"If you look at the last turnover they published, it was in the £600m-mark without winning a trophy. To still generate that kind of interest tells you [how big a club it is]. United will always be attracting players whether they are winning or losing - it doesn't matter where they are going to play.",
      "\"I can understand the local people who have always gone, and were raised, going to the Theatre of Dreams but, in reality, times move on and you have got to move with time. The game has changed.",

      "Of course, it is not just the concept of moving to a new stadium which has caused growing concerns from some sections of the fanbase. The idea of a permitted seat licence (PSL) has been mooted once United leave Old Trafford.",
      "This concept is more common in American sports. Buying a PSL would give fans the right to buy a specific seat for a set period, but they would have to pay separately for their season ticket.",
      "While this idea has not been given the green light and is subject to further fan consultations, it has increased scepticism towards the project. On the flip side, a new stadium would increase the opportunities for United to raise revenue.",
      "United will hope they can manage to attract further sporting events to the new ground and they have been listed as one of the venues for the 2035 Women's World Cup bid.",

      "Marcus Rashford has at last fulfilled his ambition of representing Barcelona at the Camp Nou. The Manchester United loanee came off the bench at the turn of the second-half on Saturday against Alaves.",
      "Rashford had previously expressed his eagerness to perform before Barcelona supporters at their legendary stadium, as the Camp Nou had been closed due to extensive £1.3billion renovation work, forcing the Catalan club to play elsewhere. After securing his loan move this summer, Rashford said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "Due to the ongoing construction works, Hansi Flick's squad kicked off their season at the Olympic Stadium. Their situation changed last weekend, though, when the club received authorisation to reopen the Camp Nou for their 4-0 triumph over Athletic Club - although with restricted attendance of approximately 45,000.",
      "Regrettably for Rashford, he was unable to feature in that homecoming fixture due to illness, instead observing from the side-lines. However, the 28-year-old finally realised his aspirations on Saturday afternoon, stepping onto the historic pitch of the famous ground as a second-half replacement for Marc Bernal.",
      "The match saw Barcelona secure a 3-1 victory, courtesy of a goal from teenage sensation, Lamine Yamal, and a brace from Dani Olmo. Since his move to Barca, Rashford has notched up six goals and nine assists in 17 appearances, as he seeks to make his mark at his new club.",
      "Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer permanent next summer for around £26million, and it seems increasingly likely they will do so, given his recent impressive form. The refurbishment of Camp Nou is slated for completion in 2027.",
      "The stadium's capacity will then officially increase to 105,000, making it the fifth-largest stadium globally. The La Liga leaders have also submitted an application to UEFA to seek permission to host their remaining Champions League home matches at the stadium.",
      "Next up for Barca is a home fixture against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, December 2, followed by an away game against Real Betis four days later. Their next Champions League match is scheduled for Tuesday, December 9, when they take on Eintracht Frankfurt at home.",
      "United have fared reasonably without Rashford this season, as Ruben Amorim finally finds his stride. After a patchy start to the season, United sit 12th in the league standings with five wins, three draws and four losses to show for their efforts.",
      "And while their most recent outing saw them suffer a 1-0 loss to a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, Amorim will hope that it was just a momentary blip - considering the club were unbeaten in their last five outings headed into the match. Next up for United is a trip to Selhurst Park on Sunday, where they face Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace in the early kick-off.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel performed Alexander Isak's goal celebration as he scored a hat-trick against Liverpool under-18s. The 15-year-old scored three times in a demolishing victory as the United youngsters beat Liverpool 7-0 away from home.",
      "The pick of his goals was a jinking run from the right-hand side which saw him skip past a number of Liverpool challenges before eventually firing into the back of the net. As the teenager wheeled away in celebration, he pointed back over his shoulder which is exactly what Isak does after scoring.",
      "It has been a while since the Swede last displayed that celebration, but it became somewhat iconic when he pulled it out after winning a header over Virgil van Dijk to score in Newcastle's Carabao Cup triumph over Liverpool.",
      "Gabriel certainly earnt the right to taunt his opposition having bagged a hat-trick which places him on 10 goals for the campaign. Darren Fletcher's side moved up to third in the standings courtesy of that victory, with a run of five games without a win put firmly behind them.",
      "Despite still being a teenager, Ruben Amorim is firmly aware of his ability and was able to see it in front of his own eyes in first-team training last month. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"We try to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty and pace of our training.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Gabriel could soon find himself in senior matchday squads given his talent, though United are likely to be careful with his development. If he was just a few years older, it is very possible a first-team debut would have arrived.",
      "Both Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will soon be heading to AFCON while Benjamin Sesko is out injured for the next few weeks. Matheus Cunha also missed Monday's defeat to Everton after suffering an issue in training, but he is expected back for next week's clash against West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "As a result of those two enforced absences, forgotten star Joshua Zirkzee started and played the full game against Everton while Shea Lacey was also on the bench. The latter is another youngster from the academy that is very highly-rated.",
      "From eight appearances for the under-21s, across Premier League 2 and the EFL Trophy, he has contributed to five goals. The 18-year-old is another young attacker that Amorim has commented on.",
      "\"I'm really happy with him,\" he said before the Everton clash. \"He struggled a little bit with injuries but they did a very good job balancing his body and you can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard.",
      "\"In Premier League games the pressure is harder, so they need to be ready. When you call a kid up to the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are putting everything in place - a nutritionist for the academy starts now - in our club.",
      "\"That is something that should be basic. All these things we are doing, so I have more time with them and I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids in to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think.\"",

      "Fans and clubs often have slightly different attitudes towards the January transfer window. If you are a supporter, you see the January window as a great opportunity to solve any problems that have developed throughout the first half of the season. Clubs think the same way, but can be wary of the mid-season market.",
      "January often sees teams who are desperate for reinforcements spend over the odds. \"We will continue to support Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] with a planned, long-term approach to recruitment, focused on the summer windows,\" Ed Woodward told Manchester United supporters in 2020.",
      "And United did not shift from that philosophy when Woodward left. United needed a goalscorer back in January 2023 and they signed Wout Weghorst on loan. It soon became apparent the Dutchman was not the talisman the Reds required. Marcel Sabitzer arrived alongside Weghorst, he too a loanee. In January 2024, no senior signing was made.",
      "Ruben Amorim's arrival last summer meant United could not afford to overlook the January market. United had to work quickly to get a player Amorim desperately needed for his system, and that player was Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Jason Wilcox said after Dorgu's arrival: \"Patrick is a really exciting talent. His strong defensive and attacking attributes, adaptability and work-rate will make him a key part of Ruben Amorim's squad. Patrick has had a superb start to his career, and at the age of just 20 we know he will continue to develop under the guidance of our excellent coaching team.\"",
      "United paid an initial £25million for the Dane and the hope was he would be the solution to the left wing-back issue. What we have found instead is the Reds are still needing to bring in a wing-back and the issue may need to be addressed 12 months on in the January transfer window.",
      "Whether it be Dorgu or Diogo Dalot, United do not look comfortable on the left flank. Dalot struggles playing on the left and is much better suited to the right.",
      "Meanwhile, Dorgu has plenty of potential to succeed at United in the future, but currently his end product leaves a lot to be desired and he is not ready to be the starting wing-back Amorim needs. The perils of the January transfer window are clear.",
      "This is not to suggest Dorgu is being written off entirely but the Reds went into the January transfer window looking for a 'plug and play' signing, but it's not worked out that way. Heading into the winter, United may choose to delve back into the market and attempt to sign a left wing-back.",
      "But the warning signs are already there. Unless United pay over the odds, very few clubs will be willing to offload their top talents midway through a season.",
      "Going into January and hoping to sign players who can change the team immediately is risky. This doesn't mean January should be written off entirely, but United cannot keep putting themselves in a position where they need to sign first-team regulars mid-season.",

      "However, Orozco will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year. He will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July.",
      "In the meantime, Orozco is set to travel to Manchester to familiarise himself with the area ahead of the move. United will also show the youngster around Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "It's understood United's deal to sign Orozco from Fortaleza is worth around $1million (£750,000).",
      "United have widened their academy recruitment in recent years due to Brexit rules, which prevent them from signing players from Europe.",
      "In January, United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Diego Leon. The deal also outlined Leon would complete his move from Paraguay in the summer window.",
      "Leon impressed coaches at Carrington and exclusively worked with the first team in pre-season.",
      "He was introduced to the Old Trafford crowd alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but he has predominantly played in academy fixtures this season.",

      "The Nuke called on United to trigger the 25-year-old's release clause, which is reported to be in the region of £65million in January. It comes amid a selection headache for Ruben Amorim, with both Amad (Ivory Coast) and Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon) set to join their international team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco next month.",
      "Morocco's Noussair Mazraoui will also depart for duty with tournament regulations stipulating that clubs should release players two weeks before their respective openers. It would mean that the trio would depart around their trip to face Wolves at Molineux on December 8, while reports suggest that the club are trying to delay sanctioning exits.",
      "Littler posted to Instagram a series of stories regarding the prospect of losing Amad and Mbeumo. The 18-year-old shared a video, titled, 'The solution to our AFCON worries?', which was footage of the United pair celebrating before it showed highlights of Semenyo's goals.",
      "The darts sensation wrote: \"Activate the release clause [wink emoji] gonna miss Amad and Mbeumo massively.\"",
      "He followed it up with a screenshot of his notifications centre on the social media platform showing Semenyo followed him. He captioned the story: \"Step one [tick emoji] I've done my job, now it's down to you Reds [wink and laughing emoji].\"",
      "Reports suggest that Semenyo – also a target for Liverpool – is on the radar as a transfer target for United. The Athletic reported that Bournemouth had 'reluctantly accepted' that they could sell the 25-year-old ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Semenyo, who signed fresh terms with the Cherries in the summer until 2030, is said to have a £65million release clause in his contract, but there is a time limit to allow Bournemouth to find a viable replacement.",
      "Littler's demands come with the January transfer just under a month away with the threat of losing two key components of Amorim's side until Janaury 17, at the latest.",

      "But what about those rarely-seen third strips? This year has seen the release of some real gems - but also a few absolute howlers.",
      "Both City and United released their alternative kits to widely different fan receptions, but who is reigning supreme over the other in this table?",
      "The City third kit was designed with the delightful Mancunian weather in mind. With a neon trim and unusual rain droplet design, this shirt has been heavily criticised by fans and rivals alike.",
      "The brightness of the neon paired with the dreary grey rain background has landed City at the bottom of the table - somewhere they are definitely not used to in recent years.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "The Bees' third kit features a bright blue background with a brown and pink stripe across the chest of the top. The club's badge is centred in the middle of the chest with just a small brown and pink trim at the collar of the shirt.",
      "While the club's original colours are featured in this rare shirt, the placement of said hues do nothing to flatter the wearer and are rather mismatched across the entire design.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Brighton had the clever idea to curb the overconsumption of football merchandise by using last season's away kit as this year's third kit.",
      "The away kit, which has been sported numerous times over the past year, features a yellow design with black vertical stripes and the club's badge prominently displayed on the chest.",
      "Although not unattractive, this kit is a carryover from last season, hence its low ranking.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Tottenham's third kit for the current season pays tribute to the 1982 FA Cup winning team, boasting a vibrant yellow base with blue detailing around the chest and shoulders, giving it a nostalgic feel.",
      "However, the retro design is juxtaposed with new sponsors and a vanishing neckline, as well as an unexpected blue colour block on the back, making it seem like a failed attempt at reviving an old classic.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Bournemouth's 2025/26 third kit is a pastel pink ensemble with purple accents. Pink kits have been associated with success in the Cherries' recent history.",
      "They famously triumphed over teams such as Newcastle and Crystal Palace away in the 2015/16 season, securing their place in the Premier League as fellow Championship jumpers Leicester City clinched the title that same year.",
      "Its relatively basic design prevents it from ranking higher on the list.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "West Ham's alternative kit offers a fresh spin on a rather plain classic. The badge is magnified and only features the two iconic hammers that are synonymous with the club.",

      "£67.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Newcastle's kit harks back to their European escapades in the late 1990s. The strip, featuring a navy blue base with orange highlights, draws inspiration from their 1997 Champions League season.",
      "This season saw memorable victories such as a 3-2 win against Barcelona and a 2-0 triumph over Dynamo Kyiv. However, it's not particularly remarkable, hence its mid-table position on this list.",
      "£84 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Nottingham Forest have embraced the Adidas trend of slim bars down the sides of the kit, reminiscent of the iconic strips from the 90s. This third shirt sports a navy blue and black design with red hems, creating a smart colour contrast.",
      "However, like many of the mid-table kits, it's not exactly a showstopper.",
      "£75 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Everton took a more unconventional approach with their third kit design, which stands out among the rest - but not necessarily for the right reasons. The black base features yellow and blue zigzag patterns running horizontally across the entire top, said to be inspired by the areas surrounding the new Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "While it's commendable that the Toffees have been more adventurous with their third kit design, the choices made leave much to be desired.",
      "£48 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Leeds United have certainly taken a gamble with their alternative strip. The blue, yellow and black design, crafted by Adidas, is said to reflect the vibrant home support at Elland Road.",
      "The kit gives off more of a rave or DJ vibe than a football strip, but kudos must be given for the creativity of the design.",
      "£45.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "FA Cup victors Crystal Palace have returned to basics with their third strip, which is unfortunate not to rank higher on this list. The red and blue stripe straight down the middle, along with one red and one blue sleeve topper, is visually pleasing and a stylish choice.",
      "The only thing that detracts from this kit is the number of sponsors on the sleeves and front of the shirt, which spoil the look. A version without sponsors would climb about five places in this list alone.",
      "£86 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Aston Villa's alternative kit has echoes of the Japan cherry blossom jersey. The shirt is reportedly inspired by stained glass windows and features a white base with shades of blue and purple across the shoulders.",

      "£59.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Does anyone else get Wetherspoons plate vibes here? The Wolves third kit is quite a sight, but it is a beautiful shade of ocean blue.",
      "This design is reportedly inspired by the vibrancy and spirit of Brazil, with fans eagerly anticipating some tiki-taka skills on the pitch soon.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Starting at seventh place, there's a trend that black kits automatically receive a major pass.",
      "Burnley's third kit bears resemblance to another on this list but ranks one spot lower due to the unusual gold specks adorning the shoulder and hip of the shirt.",

      "Next up, we have the other black-and-gold kit on this list. Fulham's alternative strip is sleek and modern, featuring a black base with gold piping around the edges of the top.",
      "While it's simple, it does the job and could be interchanged with any other club's badge without a hitch.",
      "£68 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "A shirt with a collar as unique as this earns its fifth-place ranking. The Chelsea third kit is a middle badge, blacked-out piece of beauty.",
      "The white neck trim, mimicking a wide collar, is perhaps the most intriguing part of the strip and elevates it higher on the list than initially anticipated.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Many might be surprised that this kit isn't ranked higher given the fan reaction. The Liverpool alternative top is a bright blue-green colour and features a vintage club badge that beautifully complements the shirt.",

      "£52 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Arsenal seldom disappoint when it comes to kit launches and the 2025/26 season is no exception. This third kit is designed to commemorate 20 years since Arsenal's final season at Highbury and features an alternative badge.",

      "What makes a successful Manchester United team? That is the question which is undoubtedly spinning around the mind of Ruben Amorim this week after a disappointing defeat to Everton on Monday night. In the short-term, the answer seems simple.",
      "United need to purchase players who are going to drastically improve what they are currently offering. They started this approach in the summer with Bryan Mbeumo proving to be much better than those previously occupying the attack. The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, albeit they have both had their moments.",
      "Meanwhile, Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal. Even with his mistake this week, the Belgian has been a vast improvement on Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. This transfer strategy is one which United will be looking to adopt moving forward but long-term, there needs to be a culture shift at Old Trafford.",
      "For too long there has been a sense of negativity around the club and a concern that too many players are here for the wage packet rather than to take the Reds back to the top. Amorim has worked hard to shape the club in an image which best suits his own.",
      "But changing the culture needs to be spearheaded by the players. And Amorim may find it difficult to replace one key man at the club. Speaking on the Inside Carrington podcast, Lammens was asked by Ben Foster who his 'big brother' was in the squad.",
      "He replied: \"Tom Heaton is the easy answer for me. Just the type of human he is with all the experience and making me feel at home as well. To be honest, the whole goalkeeping group is really good together.\"",
      "Third choice goalkeeper Heaton is out of contract at the end of this season and there is a feeling he may choose to retire this summer. But Lammens' comments are just further evidence of how difficult it will be to replace someone like Heaton in the dressing room.",
      "\"He (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room and provides a little bit of support to Bruno [Fernandes],\" Heaton said of the role in August. \"I am obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and will try to have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Heaton is popular in the dressing room and is clearly a big help to Amorim and his staff. Amorim will have no shortage of options for the role if the 39-year-old does depart in the summer. It is about finding the right fit and personality for the dressing room who can use his experience, not only to help his fellow goalkeepers, but to create the perfect culture for success.",
      "Heaton does that role well as evidenced by Lammens' comments so United will need to be careful when it comes to finding a replacement.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has praised the club's no-nonsense approach to the summer transfer market and believes it is something we could see more of over the coming years. United entered the summer transfer window with plenty of work to do after a lowly 15th place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Without Champions League football, there was concern Ruben Amorim would not be able to sign the players he wanted. However, the Reds managed to strengthen plenty of areas within their squad. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens all arrived last summer.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, BetWright betting ambassador Brown praised United's approach and said it's something we could see more of from the club. He said: \"I think this is the first season as a collective group where the club have gone: 'We want to buy these players, so let’s buy them,' and they’ve managed to do so.",
      "\"I think that will continue for the next two years – football is a turning wheel, but I think Manchester United are going to see more players who will be outstanding for them and really take to the team. It’s taken a while, but at the same time, Amorim must have been under so much pressure to handle everything, so you have to give him credit for that.\"",
      "While the impact made by the new signings has been positive, there is still more work to do. Midfield is an area many hope will be addressed in the upcoming transfer windows.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season and, as things stand, the Brazilian will be leaving Old Trafford. Harry Maguire also finds himself heading towards the final six months of his deal and Brown believes talks with the duo are likely top begin in January.",
      "He added: \"Casemiro is playing excellently again, but it’s a tough one because when you get to a certain age, it becomes hard for the club to justify giving someone an extra couple of years – it doesn’t work like that. I think it will firstly all depend on whether each player has any other offers elsewhere, and secondly, if the club want them to stay on, would they be happy to perhaps not play every single week?",
      "\"There’s a lot of things to consider. When you get to a certain age, I feel like you’re shown more respect by the manager and the owners – they tell you more and are more open with you about things.",
      "\"The one thing I will say is that you see a lot of players at that age with a year to go on their deals and I’ve seen them fob it off, but Harry Maguire and Casemiro aren’t doing that. Harry is putting in some of the best performances coming on and helping the team despite receiving the most stick over the past three to four years that I’ve ever seen.",
      "You can tell Casemiro still knows the game and knows what his body is telling him. There will be conversations about it in January, but nothing is 100% with these things.\"",

      "There was a bizarre situation last weekend when Matheus Cunha was forced to miss an appearance to switch on Christmas lights in Altrincham. The organisers of the event posted on social media to say Cunha had pulled out due to “medical reasons.”",
      "Manchester United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him miss the Everton game on Monday. Amorim was asked to clarify the situation ahead of the clash with the Toffees, telling MUTV: \"It was a knock in training so I don’t know how long he’s going to stay out, I think it’s nothing serious.\"",
      "In a separate interview with NBC, Amorim said: “Let’s recover Cunha, and we’ll see if he will be ready for the next game.\" The Reds are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and the expectation is that Cunha will return to the squad, which is a boost after a shocking defeat against Everton.",
      "Everton had 10 men on the pitch for 77 minutes and United could not score. They struggled to create clear-cut opportunities and the few chances that were carved out landed to Zirkzee in the box. Zirkzee is not good enough to be starting for United in the Premier League, and fans will be desperately hoping for a positive update on Cunha ahead of this weekend.",
      "Palace have the second-best defensive record in the top flight this season, with only Arsenal conceding fewer goals (six) than Oliver Glasner's side (9), who are sitting fifth in the table. Glasner has done a magnificent job since his appointment in Croydon. Palace will be hard to break down on Sunday, and Cunha has the quality to create chances or find the back of the net himself.",
      "It would be a boost for Harry Maguire to return to the squad, which will depend on whether the England international has recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered before the international break.",
      "Everton dominated aerial duels at Old Trafford earlier in the week and Maguire's presence at the back was missed. If Maguire passes a fitness test this week, he should come into the starting team for Leny Yoro.",
      "Yoro struggled against Everton. He was culpable in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal from the edge of the box, failing to commit to the challenge, which allowed the Everton man to shoot.",
      "Maguire would have played himself back into the England squad by now if not for picking up a few minor injuries, and Amorim will give an update on his recovery at his press conference on Friday afternoon.",
      "The potential returns of Cunha and Maguire feel crucial for Amorim to pick his strongest possible XI this weekend. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and fingers will be pointed at Amorim again if they end the month with back-to-back defeats.",
      "Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month for October and November was an opportunity to build further momentum ahead of the winter schedule, so the Palace clash is another big fixture.",
      "Mason Mount deserves a recall to the team and Diogo Dalot will likely start in the left wing-back role because Patrick Dorgu had another performance to forget against Everton. Dalot and Dorgu have both been unconvincing on the left this season and United need a new signing for that position.",
      "Strongest XI to face Palace: Lammens, De Ligt, Maguire, Shaw, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Mbeumo, Mount, Cunha.",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as head of senior scouting. It is understood Macaulay has been identified as the right person for the job after a four-month search to fill the vacancy.",
      "Christopher Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, the former as technical director and the latter as head of scouting while Graham Potter was at the helm. Macaulay has also worked with Potter at Ostersunds, Swansea City, Brighton and West Ham.",
      "With this being such a key role in United's recruitment set-up, Macaulay will be expected to hit the ground running when he starts his new job. The January transfer window is on the horizon and plans will already be in the works for next summer's window.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at the three positions in the team that should be on Macaulay's radar.",
      "New left wing-back",
      "Wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system. On the right, United have Amad performing well and while defensively he can improve, he is the kind of outlet Amorim's system needs.",
      "The left is more of an issue. Patrick Dorgu has potential but he is still raw and his decision-making in the final third leaves a lot to be desired. Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui just don't look comfortable as left wing-backs.",
      "Diego Leon was signed in the summer but he is still raw and getting a feel for European football. Macaulay should be tasked with finding a new left wing-back to strengthen that position.",
      "Further attacking reinforcements",
      "Joshua Zirkzee started on Monday night against Everton but he showed he isn't the centre-forward the club need. Zirkzee is better as a No.10 and so Benjamin Sesko is the only out-and-out striker at the club.",
      "The Reds had success with the strikerless system when Matheus Cunha led the line, but there needs to be another centre-forward at the club to provide competition for Sesko.",
      "Midfield overhaul",
      "Even if Casemiro stays at Old Trafford beyond this season, a new central midfielder is needed. Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club is unclear and Manuel Ugarte is still struggling to find his feet after over a year in English football.",
      "Bruno Fernandes needs a partner in the middle and with Casemiro set to turn 34 before the end of the season, United would be wise to sign a new defensive midfielder. Plans for who United will target in the summer will already be being drawn up but Macaulay could still have his say.",

      "Ahead of this weekend's Crystal Palace fixture, Manchester United supporters are split on how to line up for the encounter.",

      "Amorim was pressed to explain the circumstances before the meeting with the Toffees, informing MUTV: \"It was a knock in training, so I don't know how long he's going to stay out. I think it's nothing serious.\"",
      "For the Palace clash at Selhurst Park, Cunha culd rejoin the squad, providing a welcome lift following a disastrous loss to Everton.",
      "Others took a different view. Thetruthpersonified counters with: \"Yoro was woeful in the last match. Would prefer to see Mazraoui as the left CB v Palace. 3 at the back is an issue for me, but another pressing matter is who replaces Bruno in the middle? Bruno needs to be higher up the pitch. The Bruno CM experiment is a bust and needs to change!!\"",
      "Jungle Jerry says: \"I would rather see Mazraoui at LWB than Dalot or Shaw. I doubt that Shaw has it in him to make those forward runs and defend as well. It's a pity Amass is out on loan, but it is better for the lad in the long run.",
      "\"He has been amazing on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and the manager there reckons that Amass would easily adapt to the Premier League. Well, at least we know that he will come back and make a big call to be the first choice LWB for United!\"",
      "Amil suggests: \"How about Lammens, Delight, Maguire, Shaw, Amad Casemiro, Martinez, Dorgu/Dalot, Mbuemo, Bruno, Cunha?\"",
      "Jungle Jerry replies: \"Sounds alright except for Dorgu or Dalot at LWB. Perhaps Mazraoui can be a temporary fix there. Martinez and Casemiro in midfield would be strong defensively, but neither are really playmakers, so the midfield will lack creativity.\"",
      "IlSacristano offers: \"Give Lacey a run out in this game. He's earned it.\"",
      "Jasper JH comments: \"One thing will happen when Martinez returns, just as has happened with Rodri. The knee will be fine, but muscular injuries will occur elsewhere as he plods along the road to full match fitness. I really think we will be looking at next season before he becomes a regular starter.\"",
      "RociLal declares: \"Vitek in goal, centre back pair of De Ligt and Guehi, Amass and Mazroui/Leon as wingbacks, midfield trio of Anderson, Stiller and Cunha and forward line of Mbeumo, Sesko and Amad.\"",
      "Another fan believes: \"Mount has to start - he can drop back to help what may be an overwhelmed midfield. Hopefully, Cunha is fit enough to play. Otherwise, I'd give Lacy 15 minutes at the end. He's such a balanced, tricky, talented player who can have an effect. Everyone said Liverpool would hammer us! We need some footy luck, but anything can happen in football. Go Red Devils.\"",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo said it was a \"privilege\" to be the only black manager currently in charge of a Premier League club when he was appointed at West Ham at the start of November.",
      "He told the BBC: \"I think there are a lot of black managers with talent that can soon be involved in the Premier League. Many [black coaches] are going to have good seasons, they're going to be available.\"",
      "Nuno added that it was \"always necessary to call people's attention\" to the under-representation of coaches from ethnic minorities, but he does not believe discrimination is a factor in the recruitment of managers.",
      "However, football's new independent regulator has been called to \"address the bias\" by the co-founder of Black Footballers Partnership, Delroy Corinaldi. There are other people in the game who feel their coaching careers have been detrimentally impacted by their ethnicity.",
      "Former Manchester United coach Benni McCarthy is among those who disagree with Nuno. The 47-year-old coached at Carrington for two years as part of Erik ten Hag's backroom staff and dreams of managing in the Premier League, but has suggested his ethnicity might hold him back in the future.",
      "In an interview with BestBettingSites.co.uk, McCarthy was asked about returning to manage in the Premier League and said: \"That will always be a dream. But really, I think it's almost impossible.",
      "\"There is a very slim chance. But you have got to keep dreaming and hoping, working extremely hard towards that because when you see people looking like me, there's not a lot of us in management.",
      "\"Nuno is probably the only manager that's fortunate enough to be in such an honourable space. But for the rest of us, we'll continue to work hard and hopefully that opportunity one day comes.\"",
      "McCarthy continued: \"But if it doesn't, we will fight so that the next generation gets better opportunities off the back of the sacrifices we’ve made. It will always be a dream to manage in the Premier League or Championship. It's the best league in the world. It's the most exciting league.",
      "\"It's tough. It's got everything. So as players now turned over to become managers, you would also want to experience managing against the best teams, managing against the best managers in the world.",
      "\"To test yourself, to really put yourself out of your comfort zone. So that's what we all strive to achieve. I will continue to fight for that and hopefully one day somebody gives me the opportunity and I get to fulfil that dream.\"",
      "McCarthy landed his first managerial job with Cape Town City in 2017. He guided the South African side to their first-ever cup title, but he was dismissed two years later after a run of just two wins in 18 games.",
      "In 2020, McCarthy returned to management with another South African club, AmaZulu FC, guiding them to the CAF Champions League for the first time.",
      "McCarthy's contract was ended by \"mutual consent\" two years later, and the opportunity to coach in Manchester came next. He was a late addition to Ten Hag's backroom staff and joined as a specialist striker coach to work with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.",
      "The South African was popular with the players and was credited with having a hand in Rashford's powerful headed goal against West Ham in the Premier League in October 2022.",
      "Rashford connected with a cross from Christian Eriksen. Ten Hag and his then-assistant manager, Mitchell Van der Gaag, celebrated before shouting 'Benni!' in the direction of McCarthy.",
      "\"It's always good for the forwards to have a particular coach who focuses on us a group,\" Rashford said. \"I think since Benni has come in, we've worked more as a team going forward, which has led to us creating more chances and scoring more goals. He keeps pushing us and tries to make us improve.\"",
      "McCarthy departed United after the 2024 FA Cup triumph against Manchester City, deciding to leave to pursue management opportunities again, but it took him eight months to secure a head coach role.",
      "It was announced in March that McCarthy had been named manager of Kenya's national team, and many saw the opportunity as a potential audition to one day manage South Africa.",
      "The perception was that McCarthy had made progress during his Kenya tenure, but he suffered the largest loss of his career when his side were defeated 8-0 by Senegal during the November international break.",
      "\"McCarthy’s South Africa ambitions rocked by Kenya’s collapse against Senegal,\" read the headline of a newspaper in South Africa. McCarthy has been praised for improving standards in Kenya, but the defeat was a significant setback in his managerial career.",
      "McCarthy has taken an unorthodox route if he wants to manage in the Premier League again - most coaches in the top flight have years of experience managing in European leagues. That seems like a logical next step if McCarthy wants to manage in England again.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",

      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy in the summer, with the Spanish giants securing his services after his return to form at Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona also targeted Luis Diaz and Nico Williams in the summer, but they settled on Rashford after missing out on other options, and this risk has paid off.",
      "Rashford has six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances across all competitions for Barcelona this season as he’s become a really important player for head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "Therefore, a permanent move to Barcelona for around £30m has looked incredibly likely in recent weeks, but they face competition from PSG.",

      "The report claims:",
      "‘Barcola has lost his starting position in Luis Enrique’s systems since the arrival of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Desiré Doué , and this could lead him to accept a move to the islands.",
      "‘However, PSG believes Barcola’s market value is higher than Rashford’s, due to the considerable age difference between them. They would also demand financial compensation, in addition to the services of the current Barcelona player.’",
      "Despite this, Football Insider reporter Pete O’Rourke has explained why he thinks Barcelona are still the ‘hot favourites’ to sign Rashford permanently.",
      "“I don’t think it [PSG] will have a massive impact,” O’Rourke explained.",
      "“Barcelona are still in the driving seat to sign Rashford on a permanent basis.",
      "“They’ve got that £30million option in the initial loan deal to sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal and it does seem that there is a willingness from all parties to get a deal done.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is happy at Barcelona having moved away from Manchester United. He has found something of his best form at the Nou Camp.",
      "“He’s got six goals and eight assists in 17 games for Barca. He’s won his place back in the England squad as well now so it looks like he will be part of Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad as long as he stays fit.”",

      "“Mainoo still needs to be thinking about how to serve United, but talks about loans away won’t help him. Instead, he might see how Scott McTominay is thriving in Italy, the league’s best player. Mainoo must see that and feel tempted to explore a similar opportunity.”",

I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "Do I want Slot out ?",
      "No, not at this stage, but what he has to start showing us is that he has the ability to unpick the ball of tangled wool.",
      "As another mailboxer recently penned, the definition of stupid is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect different results.",
      "He has to show the backbone to drop out of form players – Salah should be watching Chiesa run around on the pitch rather than the other way round (although Salah isn’t doing a great deal of running at the mo !). Drop Konate for Gomez in the short term.",
      "To make an omelette, first you have to break some eggs.",
      "Where is the youth pathway currently ? (Quansah and Elliott have been jettisoned .. Rio not getting hardly any minutes) – without the flow of talent up the line from the youth setup, future transfer windows become far more expensive.",
      "If he can’t solve this, then it feels to me that Liverpool’s next full-time manager will be a Spanish bloke whose surname starts with a vowel.",
      "If the club hierarchy cherish Alonso as they appeared to in the run up to Klopp departing, they may have the patience to wait to see how the current arrangement at Real Madrid plays out and see if there is a possibility at the end of the season (nothing immediate).",
      "Iraola really interests me and clearly has something about him – there is plausible potential for that to happen mid-season, unlike Alonso, so if Liverpool decide to let Slot go mid-season it will be very telling if they seek a temporary manager until the end of the season (which will indicate favouring Alonso) or whether they go all out to get a permanent replacement in.",

      "I want to reply to this comment from Micky P, ‘I don’t think the Jota situation has ever been seen anywhere in elite sport – a player in his prime dying suddenly.’ I would refer him to the 2020 season when Kobe Bryant died. While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief. I am sure it plays a part in the situation but to write of the season seems a bit much for the ‘mentality monsters’ of LFC.\nHanKolo, Vietnam",

      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours.

I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind).

      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100million for Elliot Anderson after Manchester City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Anderson has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League this season, leading the division in ball recoveries (98).",
      "He is also third for fouls won (25), fifth for passes completed (734), and third for progressive passes (100).",
      "Anderson’s form has been a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Forest.",
      "The City Ground club are already on their third manager of the campaign after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo with Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted eight games before being replaced by Sean Dyche.",
      "While Forest, who are 16th in the Premier League, have struggled, Anderson has been fantastic under all three managers.",
      "Unsurprisingly, his form has caught the attention of several top clubs.",
      "One of those clubs is Manchester City, who are seeking a long-term replacement for Rodri.",
      "Rodri has struggled to stay fit this season after missing the majority of 2024/25 with an ACL injury, and his deputy Nico Gonzalez has failed to impress so far.",
      "Gonzalez is definitely improving, and any midfielder is a downgrade on the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner, but Pep Guardiola will have expected more from the £50million January signing.",
      "Anderson is Premier League-proven and looks the real deal. Not only has he been terrific for Forest, but he has also established himself as a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s England starting XI.",
      "He’d be a top signing for City, and according to the Daily Mail, Guardiola’s side are ‘ready to make Anderson one of their top targets in 2026’ and are now ‘ahead of’ Manchester United in the race for his signature.",
      "City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and Guardiola are huge admirers of the 23-year-old and have sent scouts to watch him this season.",
      "It’s believed Forest ‘will reject any advances in January’ and think they can hold out for £100m after the World Cup. The minimum expectation is £80m for Anderson, who appeals to City because he can play as both a No.6 and No.8.",
      "Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has also been targeted by City, but they are now more interested in the Forest star.",
      "There is also interest from Liverpool and Manchester United, while £80-100m is deemed too much by his former club Newcastle United.",

      "The midfielder wasn’t pushing to leave but wanted regular football. When the opportunity to join Forest arose, he took it, and the Magpies were happy to oblige.",
      "His exit was regarded as nothing more than a PSR sham, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction in a separate deal worth ‘£20m’.",
      "Anderson’s transfer fee on paper was £35m, but it was effectively a £15m move when you accounted for the Odysseas deal.",
      "At the time, £35m looked laughable. Now he’s worth around triple that.",
      "Not only would Anderson be perfect for this disjointed Newcastle team, with Joelinton declining, Miley showing little progression, and Ramsey and Willock injury-prone, but they will be devastated to have let a £100m midfielder, who came through their academy, leave for £15m.",

      "Manchester United are ‘preparing’ a €100m [£88m] bid to sign Federico Valverde, who could be ‘sacrificed’ by Real Madrid, and are ready to ‘bet hard’ on the ‘new Neymar’ impressing for Santos.",
      "Ruben Amorim looked to be turning things around at Old Trafford through a run of three wins and two draws, but the Red Devils returned to the doldrums with a poor performance in a 1-0 defeat to Everton on Monday.",
      "United spent over £200m on new players in the summer, mainly to bolster Amorim’s attacking options, and reports suggest their focus in the transfer market has now turned to new wing-backs and a midfielder to play alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson are thought to be their top three midfield targets, but a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they’re also interested in Valverde and are ready to make a ‘proposal of £88m’ to sign him from Real Madrid.",
      "The 27-year-old has started 11 of Madrid’s 13 La Liga games this season, captaining the side in half of them, but the report claims his ‘relationship with Xabi Alonso has deteriorated’ which ‘according to sources close to the locker room, would open the door to a change of scenery’.",
      "It’s claimed Madrid and Alonso are concerned by his ‘loss of technical confidence and the constant ups and downs of performance’.",
      "Amorim is ‘confident his addition would give an immediate leap in quality’ as he sees Valverde as ‘the ideal steering wheel to support in midfield’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘That exit would mark the beginning of a transition to a midfield with different resources, with players who dominate the break, the pass and control of the ball, leaving behind the physical versatility and dedication that the Uruguayan offered.’",
      "And the same outlet claims Manchester United are also making strides to sign the latest teenager dubbed the ‘new Neymar’ from Brazil as Chelsea’s acquisition of Estevao bears delicious fruit this season.",
      "Santos’ Robinho Junior is ‘one of the great emerging jewels of Brazilian football’ and United are the European club ‘most determined to take the final step’ to land him.",
      "The 17-year-old winger has impressed through ‘his ability to unbalance’ defenders in one-on-ones and with his eye for a pass and the report claims United believe he ‘fits the profile of a soccer player with projection, talent and room for growth’.",
      "United are ‘aware it won’t be an easy negotiation’ but are ‘willing to bet hard’ on the teenager and ‘there have already been preliminary contacts to assess the conditions’ of the transfer’.",
      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid, apparently. But how likely is that to work?",
      "Chelsea have ‘agreed’ a deal to swap Enzo Fernandez for Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde in a blow to Man Utd, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could move for former Barcelona boss Xavi if they decide to part company with current head coach Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports."

      "Paul Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Manchester United signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim looked to be turning things around at Old Trafford through a run of three wins and two draws, but the Red Devils returned to the doldrums with a poor performance in a 1-0 defeat to Everton on Monday.",
      "United spent over £200m on new players in the summer, mainly to bolster Amorim’s attacking options, and reports suggest their focus in the transfer market has now turned to new wing-backs and a midfielder to play alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson are thought to be their top three targets and Scholes has made his “pick”.",
      "“But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he’s almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "“He’s done really well at Chelsea, don’t get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I’m not sure.",
      "“Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford’s a big pitch. It’s a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "“I’d say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don’t like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "“He’s come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I’d like to see all three of them.",
      "“I’d probably say I’d go Wharton. I still don’t think they’re any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they’re more the style of football these days.",
      "“I just think Wharton’s got a little bit more quality. That’s tough saying that. I think he’s got more quality than Baleba.",
      "“Baleba’s got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It’s close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I’d just pick Wharton.”",
      "The new midfield recruit looks set to push Kobbie Mainoo – who’s yet to start a Premier League game this season – further down the pecking order, and Scholes is frustrated by the England international’s lack of game time under Amorim.",
      "He added: “Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he’s not played. You could expect that.",
      "“One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team.",
      "“We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it’s not quite happened for him. The manager doesn’t seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "“But the manager’s just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that’s something he has to deal with.",
      "“I think he’s dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "“As I’m frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don’t have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "“He [Amorim] possibly doesn’t trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn’t the most physical, but he’s streetwise. He knows the position, he’s done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he’s got that experience.",
      "“Kobbie hasn’t quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he’s going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don’t do that.",
      "“They’ve got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he’s got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "“I think he’s clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn’t seem to think he’s the answer at the minute.”",
      "Could Unai Emery replace Arne Slot at Liverpool? The Mailbox reckons the Dutchman needs to fix his side’s most ‘baffling’ problem to save himself…",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 97.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 69.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently looking over their shoulders in 20th and 22nd.",
      "Total points: 67.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Inter (UCL), Atalanta (UCL), Napoli (UCL), Juventus (UCL), Roma (UEL), Bologna (UEL), Fiorentina (UECL)",
      "",
      "Only having five teams but a couple of them being very decent means Portugal are prone to starting deceptively well here, with any wins your Sportings and Portos pick up being worth a chunky 0.4pts apiece. But will inevitably slide down the table, especially with Santa Clara failing to reach the Conference league stage and Benfica unlikely to make the knockouts in the Champions League.",
      "Total points: 47.000\nTotal teams: Five\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Sporting (UCL), Benfica (UCL), Porto (UEL), Braga (UEL)\nEliminated: Santa Clara (UECL)",
      "",
      "All four of Poland’s European representatives have wound up in the Conference, but the fact they’re all still standing and racking up points that only need to be divided by four means a strong early total.",
      "Total points: 37.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Rakow Częstochowa, Jagiellonia Bialystok, Lech Poznan, Legia Warsaw (all UECL)",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid for one of their best players who is reportedly not happy under manager Xabi Alonso, according to a report in the Spanish media, but TEAMtalk has analysed why he is very unlikely to move to Old Trafford.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a new midfielder in 2026. With Ruben Amorim’s side aiming to finish in the Premier League top four this season, signing a new player for the middle of the park is the utmost priority for the Red Devils.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest is Man Utd’s top midfield target in 2026.",
      "Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, Brighton and Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba and Wolves dynamo Joao Gomes also feature in the Red Devils’ wishlist.",
      "E-Noticies has now thrown another name into the mix, reporting that Man Utd want to sign Federico Valverde from Real Madrid.",
      "Man Utd are said to be ‘planning to submit an offer that would exceed €120million (£105.2m, $139m) for Valverde, who was described as a ‘machine in midfield’ and ‘one of the most dynamic and complete midfielders in world football’ in Breaking The Lines in July 2025.",
      "The report comes amid claims in another section of the Spanish media that the Uruguay international is not happy with Madrid manager Alonso.",
      "According to journalist Arancha Rodriguez of COPE, Valverde is one of six Madrid players who are ‘unhappy with Xabi Alonso’.",
      "Valverde has been a very reliable player for Madrid over the years, with his all-round display in the middle of the park making him hugely popular among the Santiago Bernabeu faithful.",
      "However, the 27-year-old Uruguay international, who has won LaLiga thrice and the Champions League twice with Madrid so far in his career, has failed to make a huge impact in Alonso’s system and has also been forced to play at right-back because of injuries.",
      "IN DEPTH 🔴 Ranking all 25 midfielders Man Utd have been linked with and why Premier League star should be No. 1 target",
      "E-Noticies is a Catalan news outlet, so the report about Valverde and Man Utd has to be taken with a pinch of salt, given the intense rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid.",
      "However, in fairness to E-Noticies, it has noted that Madrid have not made ‘a definitive decision’ on the future of Valverde and are ‘remaining cautious’",
      "While ‘there will be no drastic moves in January’, if Valverde gets back to his best by the end of the season, then Madrid will ‘close the door without hesitation’.",
      "This is not the first time in the Spanish media that rumours linking Valverde with Man Utd have emerged.",
      "In September, a report claimed that Man Utd were so keen on Valverde that they were ready to include Kobbie Mainoo in a deal.",
      "At the time, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, noted that Valverde will not drop down a level and join Man Utd.",
      "Jones said on September 22: “There feels pretty much no chance Man Utd will sign Valverde – even as the noise grows that they want to.",
      "“That’s the message I’m getting from people close to the Spanish end of this story, and it’s not really surprising.",
      "“He’s been around the club for almost 10 years now and has become a brilliant, crucial and adaptable player for them.",
      "“There is no need for him to drop down a level to join Man Utd, and that’s truly what it would be.",
      "“His profile would be great for Man Utd, but it just seems too ambitious to me.",
      "“The clubs may be on a similar level in terms of global status, but Madrid’s current team is in a much better place than Man Utd’s, and he is a key part of it.”",
      "It is late November now, but it is hard to think that Valverde’s stance on a potential move to Man Utd has changed.",
      "Meanwhile, Man Utd are growing in ‘optimism’ about their chances of signing a Brazilian midfielder, whose club are now ready to sell him.",
      "A Man Utd defender is ready to leave Old Trafford despite having only just arrived at the Premier League club.",
      "And finally, sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, about the chances of Man Utd agreeing a new contract with Harry Maguire."

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",

      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",

      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Could Unai Emery replace Arne Slot at Liverpool? The Mailbox reckons the Dutchman needs to fix his side’s most ‘baffling’ problem to save himself…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",

Most of them won’t remember the last time they won the Premier League title in 2012 and will be relying on tales of their exasperating greatness from parents, grandparents or millennial friends and family in order to fathom why members of an Amazonic tribe are still wearing Nike AIG Cristiano Ronaldo No. 7 shirts.",
      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But we must never discount the nagging Manchester United need to occasionally prove to the world that they are indeed Manchester United and can still attract the very biggest names in football, even when they’re not what they need in any way and are actually quite likely to undo the slight and evidently brittle improvements they’ve made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) Arsenal",
      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third. They’re ready to ‘break the bank’ as ‘favourites’ to sign him.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori has looked very comfortable on that left side of defence for Arsenal and Declan Rice can always shift across and defend when necessary as an all-round midfield master.",
      "Leandro Trossard was given his dues in the form of people who haven’t given him his dues saying others haven’t given him his dues after his excellent performance against Tottenham, but let’s be absolutely clear, Arsenal are still very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "And with eyes on the Champions League either on top of the Premier League in 2026 or after it in 2027, it would be useful to have a guy who’s won it twice and scored in both of those finals.",
      "Newcastle had not won away in the Premier League for almost eight months, but a couple of players nobody else wanted at that price helped them figure it out.",
      "Brentford have leapfrogged Spurs in the table and been an example of how to respond to the vultures, while Phil Foden finally helped out Erling Haaland.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after that absolute sh*t-show against PSV.",
      "Three of the last four Ballon d’Or winners have been first-time champions. This five will be the next to follow your Benzemas, your Rodris and your Dembeles.",
      "Manchester City are using their women’s stadium to power an academy which has already developed Foden, O’Reilly and Lewis, with sustainability at the core.",
      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump."

      "A couple of years ago, the centre-midfielder established himself as one of the best young footballers in Europe, but injuries, poor form and Amorim‘s appointment have stunted his development.",

      "Now, former Man Utd player Paul Parker has explained why he thinks Mainoo “must be furious at Amorim”.",
      "“I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,” Parker told MyBettingSites.",
      "“He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup.",
      "“He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",
      "Parker has also revealed that he is “worried about his future” as it would be a “very bad story” if he leaves.",
      "“It would be a very bad story for the club if he were to leave. Just look at McTominay,” Parker added.",
      "“I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out.",
      "“It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "He added: “He is a massive talent. Does he always make a difference? Maybe not, but he hasn’t been given the time and you are only as good as the people you are surrounded by. I definitely worry about his future.”",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",

      "This result leaves Barcelona 15th in the Champions League standings with two wins, one draw and two defeats, while they are second in La Liga after 13 matches.",
      "In recent months, the consensus has been that the Spanish side are increasingly likely to sign Rashford permanently as a £26m deal would be a bargain given his current form.",

According to sources close to the club, Rashford has created tension in the dressing room, with some players feeling that the effort of others is not matched by the Briton’s attitude. Although he continues to receive playing time and opportunities, his image within Barça is being seriously damaged.’",

      "Hugo Ekitike? Not a back-up. Another Liverpool forward soon to be mentioned? Very much a back-up.",

That is a list Mainoo tops ahead of Ethan Nwaneri, Omari Hutchinson and Vitaly Janelt, and not one a 28-year-old Italy international wishes to find himself on in a World Cup year.",

      "They have flirted with the top four this term – they’re currently 10th in the league but only three points off fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "While there’s been much-needed progress under Ruben Amorim, there are still some shortfalls. Casemiro’s resurgence in the midfield has been welcome, though he’s still not the most consistent performer, and he’s playing alongside Bruno Fernandes, who should be playing further up the field.",
      "Beyond that pair, Amorim does not seem massively fond of Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo and could instead sign James Garner.",
      "Links with a number of star Premier League midfielders have surfaced in recent months, with it known that’s the area they’re likely to prioritise next.",
      "But the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely in January as they’ll cost huge sums, and each will have a lot of interest in the summer.",
      "The links with Garner, as per talkSPORT, could mean for a welcome transfer for no fee at all. Garner is out of contract at Everton at the end of the season and Everton are said to be stepping up contract talks.",
      "But United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are all said to be keeping tabs on the situation, in case a renewal does not come to fruition.",
      "Should United land Garner, he’d be returning to the club he played his academy football for – where he was a star, but then played just seven times in the first team before being sold to Everton for just £15million.",
      "If United are able to bring him back on a free, they’d not have the embarrassment of paying a huge sum for a former academy player they let go, as was the case with Paul Pogba.",
      "Garner showed the Red Devils first hand his effectiveness as Everton beat them 1-0 on Monday night – the midfielder assisted the only goal of the game, while he also made three interceptions and one clearance, per SofaScore.",
      "United could certainly do worse than bringing the 24-year-old back, particularly if it’s for no fee.",

      "‘Confidential revealed that United struck a deal with Cameroon so Andre Onana ended up missing only one game during the last AFCON two years ago, and Amorim confirmed last week that the club are exploring ways to hold onto Mbeumo, Diallo and Mazraoui for as long as possible.’",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, has issued a warning to summer signing Benjamin Sesko and explained why he is not guaranteed to start for Man Utd when he’s fit.",
      "“We did that against Liverpool. It wasn’t with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha, and it is an option we have,” Amorim claimed.",
      "“Nowadays, not only in the English league but also in the Portuguese league and across all leagues, there is a big variation in how teams build their play. We do not control it fully. We can call it a 4-4-2, but after five minutes it becomes a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3.",
      "“I am willing to do anything. Contrary to what many people think, I am not fixed on just one idea. I simply start from a base, but it is obvious that we can adapt in future.",
      "“We have already considered that with Bryan, because he is very strong in transitions. I do not think it is his best position, because he prefers to stay hidden and not be so visible. He can attack and be more dangerous on either side, whether on the right or the left, than as a central forward.",
      "“But it is a good option and something I could use in future, as I have already done several times in the past.”",
      "Could Unai Emery replace Arne Slot at Liverpool? The Mailbox reckons the Dutchman needs to fix his side’s most ‘baffling’ problem to save himself…",
      "Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Man Utd signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs are having ‘doubts’ about head coach Ruben Amorim as they prepare to block an ‘elite’ January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Arne Slot is now second as the Liverpool collapse continues.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten."

      "Man Utd face Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday; Ruben Amorim has criticised his team's defending in recent games, with Man Utd winless in November; the head coach added there is little time to find wins and they need to happen immediately",
      "Friday 28 November 2025 15:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are \"soft\" defending their own box, adding that there is little time afforded at the club to find consistency and wins so they must happen now.",
      "At the City Ground on November 1, Man Utd conceded twice in two minutes at the start of the second half. They went on to draw 2-2, the same result they had against Tottenham the following week.",
      "And against Everton on Monday Night Football, David Moyes' side scored with their only shot on target to beat Man Utd 1-0.",
      "This season, Amorim's side have scored and conceded the same amount of goals - 19 each - and the head coach has criticised his team's defensive play.",
      "Speaking ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace, he said: \"We have some results of not letting a lot of teams in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box so we need to improve that.",
      "\"Especially against Forest - we took a lot of crosses, we didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal but we suffered a goal with the only shot on target.",
      "\"We are there near the box, we have more players than Everton, we should be better. More strong on the duels and Crystal Palace are very strong on duels and when they have to defend, they are really strong.",
      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers. It's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that's a concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive. That is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's the way you see the game and understand that if you're better in this moment, you should have more points and the narrative will be different.\"",
      "After a run of three successive Premier League wins, Man Utd have not won a league game in November, and will be hoping to put this right at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "Amorim also pointed out that the pressure to win at Man Utd is more intense than at any other club, and it will take time to find consistency with wins - something not afforded to many.",
      "He added: \"I think it's clear it will take time especially in the Premier League when every club is prepared for everything. They are improving a lot.",
      "\"We need to win now. If not, something is going to change and we know that. We just need to be better.",
      "\"Look at our games - could we have won last game? Yes. We had everything to win it. Same thing against Forest, they were suffering, we had three unbeaten and we didn't win. Tottenham the same.",
      "\"It's the urgency of winning. It's not good to be at United and not winning - there is no time here. That's why I'm frustrated all the time. We know we need time, but there is no time here so let's do everything to win games.\"",
      "There were also questions over Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to find himself with a regular starting spot at Man Utd. He was one of England's shining lights at Euro 2024, but his lack of game time at club level has seen him on the periphery of contention for next summer's World Cup.",
      "On Monday, he played half an hour against Everton, and while Amorim does not rule him out as a starter in the future, his focus is on positive results.",
      "\"This is a team sport. I have a lot of players in my squad, they want to be in the World Cup,\" he said.",
      "\"I put Kobbie [on against Everton] because he's really good near the box. Between Bruno [Fernandes] and him, he can find spaces near the box and score goals so that was my idea.",
      "\"I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try and win. I'm not focused on one individual, I'm focused on all my players and I know how special it is to play at a World Cup.",
      "\"My job is to win as a team and focus as a team. Kobbie Mainoo is in the same situation as the other guys - if I feel that's best to win the game, I will do it.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other guys. I just have to make a choice and in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. I just want to win games, I don't care who is playing.\""

      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Saturday 29 November 2025 14:06, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and tips Liverpool and Arsenal both not to win on Super Sunday.",
      "Strip the names away, hide the crests and if this was Team A hosting Team B then Crystal Palace would be odds-on.",
      "Because every measurable facet of Palace's game carries more structure, coherence and repeatability than anything Manchester United are serving up right now. This is why the 13/10 on offer for a Palace home win is dripping in value.",
      "This isn't about history. It's about now. And right now, United play football that resembles a flickering lightbulb: occasionally bright but one bad moment away from plunging a room into darkness.",
      "Palace, under Oliver Glasner, are the opposite. They look like a team. A functioning one. A confident one. A side that knows how to create, how to control.",
      "You're getting a fantastic price here on a better-drilled side, the clearer identity, the team whose game has weight and repeatability, not a historical brand propped up by recreational money in the markets. Home win.",
      "The value doesn't live in the traditional markets here as Aston Villa are rightly dominating across the board - it's hiding where Wolves under Rob Edwards are on the improve and that's their set piece output. His teams work set plays meticulously.",
      "His Luton team ranked as the best team in the Championship from set piece goals scored and expected goals output in both spells in that league while his Forest Green side ranked second for expected goals from set pieces during their promotion from League Two.",
      "We've already seen signs in one game that Wolves are taking set pieces more seriously after creating 0.77 worth of expected goals from those scenarios in the defeat to Crystal Palace. Ladislav Krejci, who has had 10 shots in his last 10 games, was the main threat and first contact from corners last weekend. He looks a tasty bet at 12/1 with Sky Bet to score.",
      "If there's one thing betting teaches you, it's that bad beats are difficult to stomach no matter how long you've been in this game for. And last week's angle, Brentford on the double chance at Brighton - still lingers like a stubborn hangover. The logic was right, the bet looked to be cashing, right up until those football gods decided that Brentford would throw away a 1-0 lead with 10 minutes to go and Igor Thiago would miss a penalty with the final kick.",
      "But here we are again, staring at a very familiar setup. And, yes, I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct, who turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 34 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only two of 16 games otherwise. Forest played 26 per cent of passes long vs Liverpool last week and a similar approach puts them in a great spot of getting another result with the 10/11 on the draw no bet standing out.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has made nine fouls in his last five games. The imperious, sometimes untouchable defender has gone missing and been replaced by a far scruffier version that is making more mistakes and committing more fouls.",
      "It took 11 games for Van Dijk to reach five fouls at the start of last season - now it looks like he can make five in one game.",
      "That player who glided through matches without needing to lay a glove on anyone is suddenly hacking, grabbing and stepping into late challenges like a man trying to put out fires with a watering can. Playing next to Ibrahima Konate can do that to a player.",
      "His direct opponent Callum Wilson is clever at tempting defenders into awkward contact and picking up soft fouls. Go back two seasons ago and Wilson was drawing 1.6 fouls per 90 in the Premier League and has won five fouls in four starts under Nuno Espirito Santo, who seems to trust him now to be the focal point.",
      "The price of 11/2 with Sky Bet for Van Dijk to make at least two fouls is massive - best price of the season territory. Take the value before the market catches up.",
      "This game stinks of caution.",
      "Those anticipating that one of these teams are going to play \"statement-making football\" could end up disappointed as these games can turn into an exercise in risk management, especially when you consider the hectic schedule both teams are facing at the moment.",
      "Enzo Maresca and Mikel Arteta are cut from the same cloth when it comes to control and not taking unnecessary risks, especially Arteta in these types of games away from home. Last season, Arsenal won just once away in their eight games with top nine opposition, drawing five of those matches. They've been beaten at Anfield this season and came through in gritty fashion at Newcastle in a very nip-and-tuck encounter.",
      "Arteta plays these games like a draw is just fine in the grand scheme of things - and he's not wrong.",
      "Both teams know that a point keeps the narrative intact. Nothing is lost, everything remains possible. The stalemate, the bet no one wants to back, is the shrewdest way to approach the outright market with 21/10 on offer with Sky Bet."

      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad and The Football, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",

Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",

      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",

      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Palace also rank among the top clubs for expected goals this season, however, Glasner suggests his deployment of the 3-4-3 formation allows his side to defend better, with the Eagles second only to Arsenal with the fewest goals conceded.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner added.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a very good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"So it's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are. I'm really looking forward to the game.\"",
      "While the formation is the same, Amorim believes the two interpretations are different. United's Portuguese boss admitted that Palace are better at performing their system.",
      "\"We play in a different way,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Asked if he is inspired by Glasner, Amorim added: \"I played against him in Frankfurt with Sporting, so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I take two weeks for an international break, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration I can.",
      "\"I have six years as a professional manager, so I am always trying to learn.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher criticised Ruben Amorim's failure to adapt his three-at-the-back system after Idrissa Gueye's red card in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton, who became the first side to win at Old Trafford in the Premier League after having a player sent off",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 10:05, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "United were booed off at full-time as Everton became the first side to win at Old Trafford in the Premier League after having a player sent off thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's first-half strike which followed Idrissa Gueye's red card for slapping team-mate Michael Keane.",
      "Neville says United, who could have gone fourth if they won by three but remain in 10th, \"were nowhere near good enough\" and \"an embarrassment at times\" as their five-game unbeaten run came to an end.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"I think they've been a lot better in the last few weeks. That probably takes us back to Brentford away.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust.",
      "\"We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
      "\"The fans booed collectively at the end. It was loud, and rightly so. That was a really poor performance.",
      "\"It's almost as if you've gone sort of like two or three steps forward, everyone's feeling a little bit better about themselves, and you've just gone back to the start again.",
      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",
      "United were without summer signings Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko due to injury at Everton with Amorim forced to go with Joshua Zirkzee up front, the forward making his first start for the club since last April.",
      "But Neville refused to accept that as an explanation, adding: \"Forget [injuries to Sesko and Cunha], there are no excuses. I'm not entertaining that one bit.",
      "\"Everton dominated them with 11 men and with 10 men, in a different way of domination, but they dominated them through their fight and their spirit.\"",
      "\"This is a bad night for the manager. There was an awful long time left in that game [after 10-man Everton went ahead].",
      "\"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that when it's basically one guy up front who's not really up front, you don't need three players there.",
      "\"It's one of those moments where I think a lot of people will really question the manager on the back of that defeat.",
      "\"They'll look at the players, and we know the players should do better, but the manager will take a lot of the blame for tonight.\"",
      "Neville, speaking on co-commentary, was critical of Amorim when he brought on Diogo Dalot for the struggling Patrick Dorgu and slammed the \"ambling\" Luke Shaw's effort.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas.",
      "\"You have Shaw, (Leny) Yoro and (Matthijs) De Ligt behind the ball. Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling, you can't do that. He should be running forward every single time, I don't care.",
      "\"Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's a waste of time. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer. Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? They still don't win the first ball or the second ball. Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks.",
      "\"It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",

      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has claimed his side are \"nowhere near\" where they need to be and hopes they \"fight each other\" after losing to 10-man Everton.",
      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",
      "But overall, it represents a new low for Amorim, who celebrated one year in charge of United in dismal fashion.",
      "\"We are not there, not even near the point that we should be to fight for the best positions,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect today.",
      "\"When we see the results of the weekend, we should get onto the pitch with a different excitement. Old Trafford was there saying 'we are all here for a big step up'. And we were not ready.",
      "\"These five weeks, everyone is praising our evolution. But I'm always saying the same things: we are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be in this club.\"",
      "Gueye's bizarre red card left Amorim wishing he had seen the same sort of fight from his own players.",
      "\"Fighting is not a bad thing,\" he added. \"Fighting doesn't mean you don't like each other. Fighting means you lose the ball and I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling.",
      "\"I don't agree with that red card. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other - though they cannot get sent off! But that is a good feeling, not a bad feeling.\"",
      "Amorim also admitted he is concerned about returning to the feeling of last season - which ended in a 15th-place finish, no trophies and no European football for this season.",
      "\"I feel afraid of returning to this feeling of last season,\" said Amorim. \"That is my biggest concern. We need to work together. The players are trying but we need to be better.\"",
      "Gary Neville branded United's performance as an \"embarrassment\" at Old Trafford - while Jamie Carragher feels Amorim's credentials will be questioned on the basis of that performance.",
      "Amorim was criticised throughout the match for not moving away from his much-maligned 3-4-2-1 formation and continuing with five defenders on the pitch, despite having the player advantage.",
      "\"It was nowhere near good enough,\" said Neville on the Gary Neville Podcast. \"That was a really bad night for Man Utd, it was an embarrassment at times.",
      "\"Forget [injuries to Sesko and Cunha], there are no excuses. I'm not entertaining that one bit.",
      "\"Everton dominated them with 11 men and with 10 men, in a different way of domination, but they dominated them through their fight and their spirit.",
      "\"It's complacency, and complacency will kill you. The minute that you think as a football player that you just have to turn up on that pitch and you're Manchester United and you can play or any football club, you're done.",
      "\"It just smelt of complacency [from United]. They weren't at it from the beginning. That is a bad one for United.",
      "\"You can't go from the fight that they showed in certain games to that. It just erodes confidence, it erodes trust. We're trying to build a trust in a manager, we're trying to build a trust in a team.",
