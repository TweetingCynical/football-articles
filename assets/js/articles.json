      "Pundit and former England star Alan Shearer believes it is premature to talk about Manchester United as contenders to qualify for the Champions League. Ruben Amorim's side have a chance to end the weekend in the top four if they beat Nottingham Forest to make it four wins on the spin.",
      "The pressure was on Amorim ahead of a home meeting with Sunderland in October. They won that game, and followed it up with victories over Liverpool and Brighton as the new-look front three of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko started to click.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to the City Ground and now it's his opposite number Sean Dyche who is up against it. \"It was a poor result for Sean Dyche against Bournemouth, especially after doing so well in Europe. It will be a rocking atmosphere at Forest, as always when Man United come to town,\" Shearer told Betfair.",
      "\"United are looking for results to keep the good run going and they’ve had a week off due to being knocked out of the Carabao Cup. I think Forest will get something out of the game, but I'm not sure they'll win, so I'm going to say a draw.",
      "\"I think it’s too early to say they’re the real deal and that United can finish in the top four or five. If they can continue this in a month's time, I might change my mind, but let’s see what the next couple of weeks bring, and then we can judge whether they’re certainly improving.\"",
      "Shearer's comments come as Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White made the unusual move of publicly showing his delight in United's persistence and turnaround. \"It’s been incredible to see, obviously they’ve been going through a tough time in the past couple of years,\" the England international told Stan Sport (via Goal).",
      "\"But they’ve stuck with the gaffer [Amorim] and the past four or five games, you’re really starting to see how Man United should be playing, that grit and that determination to want to play for the badge. I feel like it’s been incredible to see, it’s something I feel like the league has missed.\"",
      "“They are beginning to turn things around, it seems, but we have to safeguard against that,\" Dyche said of United. \"There are subtle changes in the way they’re playing, and they have delivered performances that can win. We’ve got to be aware of that, but equally – if you look at our performance against Porto – that was a performance that we think would win against a lot of teams.",
      "“We need to find our own freedom to it, especially here at the City Ground, where they’re always in good voice, but against the bigger names, on paper. We think we can get that energy between us and that front-foot thinking from the stands, which the players will buzz off.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Scholes' daughter, Alicia, has emotionally shown her own support for her dad after he bravely opened up about caring for his autistic son Aiden. The Manchester United icon revealed he stepped away from live TV work this season to focus on caring for and spending more time with his 20-year-old autistic son.",
      "\"I made a decision this year because of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about,\" Scholes told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"All the work I do now is just around his routines because he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do it is around Aiden.",
      "\"We always do the same things with him as he doesn't know what day of the week it is or time. But he'll know from what we're doing what day it is.\"",
      "Scholes revealed he and wife Claire have split up, but they continue to devote themselves to their three children. Discussing Aiden's routine, he added: \"I pick him up every Tuesday from his daycare and we go swimming. Loves swimming then we get his pizza on the way home. Thursday pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",
      "\"So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",
      "Alicia has subsequently taken to Instagram to praise her dad's courage in speaking about her brother. She wrote: \"I’ve never known anyone hate talking about themselves more than you! I can only imagine how hard it was to speak about Aidie and the reality of a very very hard situation.",
      "\"My whole life your priority has always been being my dad, and growing up and realising how hard you had to work everyday alongside that is something I can’t even comprehend.",
      "\"To achieve all you did takes so much sacrifice and hard work and somehow I still had you to take me to school every morning and be there at the end of each day, so present in every aspect of my life! If anyone met you they wouldn’t have a clue the life you’ve lived, they’d just see a genuinely kind, polite, caring person",
      "\"You don’t care about people who don’t matter, and out of everything that is the most valuable thing i have learnt from you. The thing I am proudest of is being your daughter, you are the best role model and father figure I could ever have, and you do it so effortlessly.",
      "\"Anyway well done on this episode dad it was amazing and if Aidie could tell you himself he would say you really are the best dad in the world, we love you millions.\"",
      "The post received multiple replies, including one from United legend David Beckham, who wrote: \"Perfect words for your amazing dad.\"",
      "In addition to Alicia and Aiden, Scholes has another son named Arron.",
      "Alicia is a netball player who plays as a wing attack and centre. She joined London Pulse in 2021 and helped the club win the Netball Super Cup in July 2025, the first in their history.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim wasn't the only contender to replace Erik ten Hag in 2024. United also explored moves for Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi several months before landing the Portuguese, it has been claimed.",
      "Ten Hag's position was under threat towards the end of the 2023/24 season, with the Premier League side considering their options after some concerning results and performances. After winning the FA Cup final, though, the Dutchman was given a stay of execution.",
      "By the time Ten Hag eventually lost his job in October last year, De Zerbi and Tuchel had already found employment elsewhere. Former Brighton boss De Zerbi took over at Marseille shortly after leaving the Amex Stadium while Tuchel agreed terms with England in the autumn and ultimately took charge in January 2025.",
      "According to The Athletic, United were still considering Tuchel a fortnight after their cup final win. The German met with United chiefs in Monaco but didn't reach an agreement and indeed is said to have not been prepared to return to football so soon after leaving Bayern Munich.",
      "De Zerbi's talks, meanwhile, were reportedly halted after the Italian rejected an initial offer from United. An improved offer didn't arrive, and the 46-year-old is now in charge at Marseille.",
      "Ultimately, Ten Hag was backed in the transfer market to the tune of around £200million as United looked to turn things around under the ex-Ajax boss. He only lasted a few months, picking up 11 points from nine league games to leave United 14th in the table.",
      "Results picked up under caretaker boss Ruud van Nistelrooy but Amorim was unable to inspire a full recovery in the league. He led the team to a Europa League final - and within 90 minutes of a trophy and a Champions League spot - but an eight-game winless run in April and May brought a 15th-place finish.",
      "United made a slow start in Amorim's first full season but things have gradually picked up. Three wins on the spin have seen the Red Devils climb a congested table to sit in sixth place ahead of Saturday's meeting with Nottingham Forest.",
      "“During my career as a manager, most of the time I was winning,” Amorim told MUTV as he brought up a year in charge. “When you are winning, you can say that you have convictions and you are loyal to your ideas, but you learn when you lose, when you are under pressure and I learned that when I’m under pressure, I’m stronger on my ideas and I keep with my ideas.",
      "“Of course, it’s really important to feel the support of everyone in the club, especially the fans that help you, to give you that confidence to continue on your path, but that was the biggest learning point: when I’m under pressure, I can stick with my plan.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Current and former team-mates took to social media to send their well-wishes, and Fernandes was among the first to post, sharing a selfie of the pair on his Instagram story. He tagged Rashford, writing: \"Happy birthday broski. Enjoy your day as you deserve.\"",

Yet, he failed to nail down a regular spot under Vincent Kompany and was shipped out on loan to Tottenham this summer - with Spurs holding a £27million option to make the deal permanent.",
      "\"Joao Palhinha is a great player. I played with him at Sporting, where he was growing and learning a lot,\" the former Red Devils' winger revealed to Covers.com. \"After a few years, he became one of the best players in his position.",
      "\"He's very strong and talented at winning and recovering the ball, and also tackling. He's also improved his forward play, scoring goals, connecting with the team, and moving forward with the ball. He's become a complete player in his position.\"",
      "With doubts over whether Tottenham, or not, will trigger their buy-out clause to secure his services permanently next summer, Nani has urged United to try and scupper any possible agreement between the north London outfit and Bayern.",
      "\"I think he's a great player and can do really well for Tottenham. He had an opportunity with Bayern and we're not sure what will happen next season, but he's a player who can play for any team in the world,\" he added.",
      "\"He just needs to be consistent and fit, as injuries cause problems. I trust he will have a fantastic career. He's a player with energy, with power to recover balls and to fight, and that is something that fits into Man Utd's DNA.",

Saturday marks Amorim's one-year anniversary at Old Trafford and he'll be eager to celebrate the occasion by guiding United to a fourth straight win - something the club hasn't achieved in nearly two years.",
      "Nottingham Forest, by contrast, are in search of stability after a turbulent start to the season. Sean Dyche is already the club's third manager of the campaign, having replaced Ange Postecoglou last month - just 39 days after Postecoglou himself succeeded Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "An emphatic 2-0 Europa League win over Porto last week suggested the tide could be turning, but Forest were brought back down to earth a few days later by Bournemouth, who beat them by the same scoreline. Three points against United would certainly be a mood-lifter, but that'll be easier said than done.",
      "The visitors arrive in fine form, buoyed by victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton in the past month. Amorim's side are beginning to look far more cohesive and confident in possession, with his philosophy clearly starting to take hold.",
      "Nottingham Forest's clash against Manchester United takes place on Saturday, November 1. The game will be held at Forest's home stadium, the City Ground, with kick-off at 3pm UK time.",
      "No. The match will not be broadcast on live TV due to the UK's 3pm blackout rule. Instead, fans can follow the action live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.",

      "Harry Maguire was the only notable absentee - aside from long-term injury victim Lisandro Martinez - for last weekend's win over Brighton. The England international could return to the squad against Forest, though United are unlikely to risk rushing him back.",
      "After picking up a knock last week, Mason Mount was left on the bench against Brighton. He is, however, expected to be fully fit for the Forest game. Luke Shaw was also a doubt heading into the clash against the Seagulls after coming down ill, yet managed to play through it.",
      "Amorim did, however, admit the defender was \"suffering\" during the game. These concerns aside, the United boss is likely to have close to a full-strength squad at his disposal.",
      "Chris Wood is yet to feature under Dyche after sustaining an injury last month, though the New Zealand striker could return to contention this weekend. However, Forest may opt against rushing him back into action.",
      "Elsewhere, Dyche will be without Ola Aina, who remains sidelined with a thigh problem, while Dilane Bakwa is also unavailable. Oleksandr Zinchenko faces a late fitness test, with his involvement still in doubt.",
      "Forest have a strong recent record against United, having won three of their last four meetings between the two sides. They completed the double over Amorim's team last season, winning 1-0 at the City Ground in April and 3-2 at Old Trafford the previous December.",
      "United's last Premier League triumph over Forest came back in August 2023. Before that, the Red Devils had enjoyed a dominant run of 10 consecutive victories over the East Midlands outfit, a streak that stretched all the way back to 1996.",

      "The Manchester United squad answering Bruno Fernandes' demand for a tactical change has proved crucial in sparking their current winning streak. Ruben Amorim's team have won their previous three league games, with United hoping to make it four victories on the bounce in their visit to Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",
      "While Amorim recently orchestrated a stunning 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield, the Red Devils' subsequent 4-2 home triumph against Brighton last weekend was perhaps even more important. Goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and a Bryan Mbeumo double helped create the belief that United's promising form might be more than a brief hot streak.",
      "United boss Amorim has faced fierce criticism during his reign for his unwavering commitment to his 3-4-3 system. Many pundits and United supporters previously argued that the team were poorly suited to the formation.",
      "However, Fernandes predicted how United could transform their fortunes following the club's 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City in September. The United captain emphasised that for the side to flourish, more players needed to drop into midfield.",
      "The midfield partnership of Fernandes and Casemiro was frequently overwhelmed during the opening weeks of the campaign before United started to follow their skipper's advice. Fernandes highlighted the issue when comparing United's shortcomings to City's flurry of midfielders.",
      "\"If you look at City, they had Rodri, Tiji [Reijnders], Bernardo [Silva] coming in, [Phil] Foden. They make basically a midfield four against a two.",
      "\"So you need the ones in behind you to jump, like Luke [Shaw] was doing very well on Tiji. We did it in the first game against Arsenal, that's why they didn't play. They couldn't find the spaces to play.",
      "\"That's what makes the spaces very narrow to play against a team that is very aggressive to play on the front foot. If you're not brave enough to do that, they will find the spaces to play because we're playing against a top opponent.\"",
      "It appears the United squad have taken Fernandes' request on board. Luke Shaw, in particular, received praise for his recent display against Brighton, at times advancing from his role in the back three into the midfield.",
      "The extra backing for Fernandes and Casemiro gave United greater stability, enabling the team to thrive. Meanwhile, Shaw claimed an assist for Casemiro's deflected strike against Brighton after challenging for possession in midfield.",
      "\"What Man United have been crying out for is if you're going to play that system, be brave,\" former City defender Micah Richards said on The Rest Is Football podcast. Luke Shaw was very brave the way he stepped in, and then they go and get the goal.",
      "\"If you look at the positioning yesterday of Cunha, Cunha was filling in in that midfield role.\" He continued: \"That's the first time I've been convinced that [United] know exactly what their roles are. Now the challenge is consistency.\"",
      "The tactical flexibility shown by both Shaw and Cunha gave United the numerical advantage that Fernandes believed was lacking in the match against City. A few weeks later, United's response to their captain's plea for more support has been key to their winning streak.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The former Manchester United midfielder departed Juventus in mid-November after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract in Turin. That move came six weeks before Pogba could return to training following his doping suspension, which Pogba claims was because of a prescribed nutritional supplement.",

      "\"Paul still has a training session on Thursday, and if he is feeling good, we could see him again. And he would be within the process that we fixed.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the midfielder is not in good shape after that session, having sustained an ankle injury. \"We are awaiting confirmation of the severity of the injury,\" Pocognoli said.",

      "Arne Slot and Virgil van Dijk have both received a stark warning amid Liverpool's alarming slump in form. The Reds have suffered four consecutive Premier League defeats and exited of the Carabao Cup at the hands of Crystal Palace earlier this week.",
      "Liverpool's string of losses has heaped mounting pressure on Slot's position as head coach. Yet former Manchester United assistant Rene Meulensteen, who worked alongside Sir Alex Ferguson, has outlined why several factors may be behind the Reds' worrying decline.",
      "“They [Liverpool] were winning games in the first games of the season but they were dragging themselves over the line in the last few minutes so the writing was on the wall and they’ve gone from leading the title race to being several points behind,\" Meulensteen told compare.bet.",
      "\"That's an enormous shift but Slot has not turned into a bad manager. His coaching staff aren’t suddenly bad coaches.",
      "\"They haven't suddenly turned the messaging to the players from black to white. It’s the same with the players.",

      "“Everybody's starting to question Mohamed Salah now but he hasn't suddenly turned into a bad player. He has had these spells before where he suddenly hits a bit of a dry patch.\"",
      "Meulensteen continued by highlighting why he thinks senior figures like Van Dijk need to immediately demonstrate their leadership qualities to stop Liverpool's losing streak.",
      "“They have to go back to themselves and say, when were we at our best and what were the reasons why? The key is making sure that you don't start pointing fingers at each other,\" Meulensteen added.",
      "\"You look at yourself first and make sure that you stick together. You say let's bring the best out of each other again. It starts with hard work, working together, doing your defensive jobs and making sure those players who thrive on being able to express themselves have the courage to play their best football.",
      "“That's what those big players do and there's no harm in asking the big players to step up. Virgil Van Dijk is still there. Dominik Szoboszlai is only getting better and better. They’ve still got Alexis Mac Allister. Salah is still there.”",

      "Despite coming under immense pressure at the start of the season, calls for Amorim to be replaced have quietened. But ex-United defender Jones recalled one thing that made the iconic Ferguson great which could allow Amorim to keep up such results.",
      "\"I always say the best thing about Sir Alex Ferguson is he knew his team like four weeks in advance,\" said Jones, speaking with BetMGM.",
      "\"I was out with my ankle and I remember he came up to me, it was like three weeks before this game he was referring to and he said, 'Get yourself ready for the Wigan game away. It's a big game, and we're going to need to win. You're playing right back.'",
      "\"And I was thinking, 'Yeah, good one' I'm not going to play. I'm not going to be playing. It's three weeks away. I'm still out. I've not even been on the grass yet.'",
      "\"Lo and behold, get to the game and I'm starting right back. It's the aura of the guy and just knowing how to handle every individual player.",
      "\"I mean, we talk about managers and coaches tactically on the pitch these days and they're so tactically astute, inverted full backs, tens, rotations and all that sort of stuff. But forget all that.",
      "\"What he had was an understanding of every single player and how to interact with them, at what time to interact with them, how to deliver the interaction. He just got it bang on every time. Players would run through a brick wall for him.\"",
      "What Ferguson also possessed was the ability to dish out criticism when it was warranted. Jones recalled a time when some in-game decisions landed him in the manager's bad books.",
      "\"There was one time, I think we played Athletic Bilbao and it was the first season when David de Gea, for as amazing as he was, he had a difficult start to the season. Every mistake that he made unfortunately as a goalkeeper led to a goal,\" said Jones.",
      "\"We played Bilbao at home, we were 1-0 up, and I passed the ball back in the last 10 minutes to him. He's gone to clear the ball and as he's cleared the ball, it sort of landed straight to the number nine and they've gone and scored from there.",
      "\"Now, I'm not even thinking that I would be culpable for the goal, but obviously we're all culpable. Coming in after the game, he [Ferguson] has hammered me about my back pass, saying that it was too strong for David. It's only now that I realise that he was just trying to protect David, really.",

      "Ruben Amorim has overseen major reconstruction during his first year in charge of Manchester United. The Portuguese coach, who officially took the reins exactly 12 months ago, has been busy in the transfer market, bringing in a wealth of new talent to mould the squad in his image.",
      "Over £250million has been invested in seven new players, ranging from proven internationals to rising stars. The mix includes both instant-impact signings and long-term projects, each carrying big expectations.",
      "Some of these additions have impressed immediately, while others are still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League. Supporters are eager to see who can adapt fastest to life at Old Trafford. Below, we've rated every one of Amorim's transfer based on their impact so far, value for money and overall potential.",
      "Grade: 2/5",
      "Since his arrival midway through last season, Patrick Dorgu has shown flashes of ability. His speed, energy, and flexibility have added useful depth - and as the squad's only natural wing-back, he fits the exact mould Amorim prefers.",
      "However, he hasn't yet fully met expectations or nailed down his spot on the left side, with right-footed Diogo Dalot often preferred recently. Dorgu's delivery and defensive awareness remain inconsistent.",
      "At £25m, Dorgu is far from a disastrous signing, and there's optimism he can grow into the role. Still only 21, the Danish youngster needs to produce more decisive displays to persuade Amorim - and the fans - that he's ready for a long-term first-team position.",
      "Grade: 3/5",
      "Ayden Heaven has quickly become one of the most exciting defensive prospects since his £1.5m move from Arsenal. Although his minutes have mostly come as a substitute, he's demonstrated plenty of promise through a series of composed cameos.",
      "He grabbed an assist in United's 4-2 victory over Brighton last weekend and continues to impress with his physicality, sharp tackling and recovery pace. Whether he can secure a regular starting place remains uncertain, especially with Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Lisandro Martinez ahead of him.",
      "Should he break into the senior line-up, Heaven would represent a stunning bargain and a real miss for Arsenal. Even if not, he could still develop into a reliable squad option - or earn United a healthy profit should other teams come knocking for a young centre-back with potential.",
      "Grade: 3/5",
      "After a hesitant - and worryingly subdued - start, Benjamin Sesko is beginning to justify his hefty £74m fee. The Slovenian forward possesses all the qualities of a top-tier striker - strong technique, a fierce shot and impressive physicality - but he still needs consistent confidence to piece it all together.",
      "He opened his United career with six matches without scoring, but has since contributed two goals and an assist in his last four outings, gradually growing in influence. His link-up play has helped United’s attack function more fluidly, offering far more than just finishing power.",
      "It may take time to fully validate such a huge price tag and Sesko still has plenty to prove before being seen as the man to revive United’s glory days. Yet for now, his trajectory is encouraging.",
      "Grade: 4/5",
      "Five goals in 10 appearances speaks volumes. Bryan Mbeumo has been one of Amorim's most effective additions, quickly adapting and carrying over the form that made him a star at Brentford.",
      "Operating primarily as a right inside forward, he's tormented defenders with his relentless movement and trademark cuts onto his left foot. With Sesko still adjusting and Marcus Rashford out on loan, Mbeumo's creativity and goals are vital to United's campaign.",
      "Many questioned his £70m valuation, but he's performing at that level so far - his brace against Brighton perfectly illustrating his impact.",
      "Grade: 3/5",
      "It may have taken Matheus Cunha nine matches to find the net for United, but the Brazilian has quietly made a positive impression. He's brought flair, vision and tireless work to the frontline, while his ability to play across multiple roles makes him invaluable.",
      "That same versatility, however, has slightly hindered his rhythm. Constantly rotated across the attack and occasionally filling in as a No. 9, Cunha hasn't settled into a defined position or hit consistent form. Still, after netting against Brighton, he may be ready to kick on.",
      "For £62.5m, United will expect his flashes of brilliance to become a regular occurrence. Should that happen, his signing could turn out to be excellent value.",
      "Grade: 4/5",
      "After the uncertainty surrounding Andre Onana, almost any alternative felt like an upgrade - but Sanne Lammens has exceeded expectations. Brought in from Royal Antwerp for £18m, the Belgian had to wait for his chance, initially backing up Altay Bayindir.",
      "Once handed his debut against Sunderland last month, he never looked back. Calm in possession, sharp with his reflexes, and assured under pressure, Lammens has restored a sense of stability and confidence to United's defence.",
      "Grade: 1/5",
      "It's difficult to judge a player who hasn't featured yet. Diego Leon appears to be an exciting talent, but without a senior appearance to his name, any verdict would be premature.",
      "He fits Amorim's tactical blueprint perfectly as an adventurous wing-back, but whether United's £6m outlay pays off remains to be seen. Still only 18, Leon has plenty of time to develop - likely through a loan spell - before being truly ready to challenge for a first-team spot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

They are currently down in the relegation zone, while visitors United are enjoying their best run of results in over a year, winning their last three games to take them up the table.",

As quoted at a charity event by the Daily Mail in 2015, the 54-year-old insists the only English team he actually supports is Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "He said: \"Just because I played for Manchester United didn't mean I was a fan of the team. When I played for Rockmount, one of my team-mate's fathers used to bring me to training and he supported Tottenham.",

      "“I grew up in Ireland remember. Of course, I played for the club and you are grateful for that. I say you have a soft spot for them. The results wouldn’t be making or breaking your weekend. The same for Forest and Celtic. The clubs I was involved in. Absolutely not.",

      "Few managerial debuts at Manchester United have been as turbulent as Ruben Amorim's. Hailed as a modern tactician and a symbol of renewal upon his arrival from Sporting CP, the Portuguese coach has endured a year that has often veered from difficult to disastrous.",
      "Expectations were high, but the harsh reality of Premier League football has left him exposed to mounting criticism, lingering uncertainty and an increasingly restless fanbase. In the 12 months since his appointment, Amorim has spent more than £250million reshaping the squad, yet tangible progress remains elusive.",
      "Performances have fluctuated wildly, results have disappointed and the team's identity continues to feel like a work in progress rather than a finished product. His outright refusal to budge from his 3-4-3 system - a formation demanding both tactical discipline and a full-scale personnel overhaul - has also come under scrutiny.",
      "Adaptation has been painfully slow, though flashes of cohesion in recent weeks suggest the tide may be beginning to turn. For now, however, those glimpses of optimism have been too fleeting to silence his critics.",
      "Grade: D",
      "Amorim's inaugural year at United has been defined by persistent inconsistency and underwhelming performances, particularly in the Premier League last season, where the team slumped to an abysmal 15th-place finish - the lowest in the club's history.",
      "While there were flashes of promise in the Europa League, a crushing defeat to a similarly unconvincing Tottenham side in the final not only denied United a shot at silverware and a return to the Champions League, but also encapsulated the malaise engulfing the club.",
      "The campaign was plagued by defensive frailties and a lack of cohesion, with United frequently looking disjointed on the ball and alarmingly fragile off it. It also took Amorim over 11 months to record consecutive Premier League victories - a stark measure of his slow adaptation to the demands of English football.",
      "Recent weeks have offered tentative signs of improvement, with a string of positive results injecting some optimism into the 2025/26 campaign. However, these flashes of form cannot mask the broader narrative of mediocrity, with Amorim winning just 40 per cent of his matches in all competitions.",
      "Ultimately, the Portuguese coach has fallen far short of expectations at a club crying out for revival. The occasional bursts of positivity offer some hope, but they are dwarfed by a year defined by inadequacy, inconsistency and unmet promise.",
      "Grade: B",
      "Amorim's recruitment has been a bright spot in an otherwise turbulent year. The £200m outlay on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo appears to have been money well spent, with the trio injecting much-needed energy and purpose into United's attack. Meanwhile, Senne Lammens and Ayden Heaven look like shrewd, low-cost additions who could prove valuable over time.",
      "Each signing reflects a clear targeting of profiles that suit Amorim's tactical blueprint. United needed dynamic wing backs - in came Patrick Dorgu. They needed versatile inside forwards - enter Mbeumo and Cunha. This has not been scattergun spending, it's been recruitment with intent and precision.",
      "That said, their business has not been flawless. None of the new arrivals have yet delivered truly transformative performances and critics might argue that Amorim focused too heavily on reinforcing attacking areas while leaving persistent weaknesses at wing back, centre back and centre midfield largely unaddressed.",
      "Still, the overall spend represents a step forward - a more coherent, strategic approach to squad building that refreshes the team without the reckless extravagance of previous regimes. It's recruitment that earns a respectable grade for both its clarity of vision and long-term potential.",
      "Grade: C",
      "Assessing Amorim's player management is tricky - it's been a clear case of hits and misses. On the positive side, his firm stance with underperforming stars such as Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho last season deserves recognition.",
      "By side-lining them for poor application in training, Amorim sent a strong message about standards and accountability, something that had seemingly eroded under Erik ten Hag. Several senior players - most recently Mason Mount - have since praised his approach and reports suggest the overall dressing-room atmosphere is far more unified than it used be.",
      "However, these positives are offset by notable missteps. The prolonged isolation of Rashford and Garnacho ultimately damaged both their confidence and their market value. United received just £40m for Garnacho in the summer, having asked for £70m in January, while Rashford's resurgence at Barcelona has cast doubt on Amorim's judgement in deeming him expendable.",
      "The underuse of academy prodigy Kobbie Mainoo is another concern. Amorim's apparent lack of faith in the midfielder risks alienating a homegrown talent who could become a cornerstone elsewhere if not handled carefully.",
      "In sum, Amorim's handling of players has combined moments of strong leadership with costly errors in man-management. The squad appears more disciplined and unified - but the lingering fractures and questionable personnel calls justify only a middling grade.",
      "Grade: F",
      "Amorim's first year has produced little to celebrate. The former Sporting CP coach initially failed to halt United's decline and despite steadying to wobbling ship in recent weeks, tangible results are yet to be achieved.",
      "Under Amorim, United spent the bulk of last season hovering just above the relegation zone and a torrid 15th place finish, coupled with a crushing defeat in the Europa League final, left the season empty of both silverware and optimism. United swung and missed at every opportunity for progress.",
      "This season has brought more of the same. A humiliating League Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town extinguished what was arguably their best chance at a trophy and while things are looking up in the Premier League at the moment, United are still a long way from being where they'd like to be.",
      "On paper, Amorim's tenure has yielded nothing of substance... yet. A recent run of three consecutive league wins has injected a flicker of hope, but the manager remains without a single meaningful milestone or success to his name. In short, it has been a year of unrelenting underachievement - and one that fully justifies the harshest possible grade.",
      "Grade: C",
      "Fan sentiment towards Amorim is broadly supportive yet laced with frustration, reflecting a base of goodwill tempered by impatience for consistent results. Many appreciate his articulate communication, his grasp of United's storied heritage and his realistic pledges to restore glory without overpromising. That authenticity has earned him patience from a fan base desperate for stability and a return to top-four contention.",
      "Still, scepticism lingers. Many supporters question whether Amorim has the pedigree to end United's long Premier League drought, with little in the way of consistent results to inspire confidence. Since March, United have managed just six league wins - a statistic that fuels the argument that progress under Amorim is more theoretical than tangible. Calls for his dismissal, though still a minority view, have grown louder in certain corners of the fanbase, particularly after their slow start to the current campaign and in the wake of the Grimsby result.",
      "Overall, fans appear to admire his tactical ideas, philosophy and temperament, but their endorsement remains conditional. Until Amorim can translate principles into sustained success, belief in his long-term project will remain hesitant - and, for now, a C grade feels about right.",
      "Grade: B",
      "The board, spearheaded by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS, maintains strong backing for Amorim, viewing him as a strategic, long-term appointment deserving of patience to embed his philosophy. Substantial transfer support - evidenced by the £220m summer outlay - signals confidence in his blueprint and Ratcliffe's public commendations point to a belief in his potential to rebuild sustainably.",
      "That said, there are signs of pragmatic caution behind the scenes. Reports of contingency planning for a possible dismissal suggest the board is prepared to act if results take another downward turn - a reminder that Amorim's position is far from secured. After all, Ten Hag was similarly backed both publicly and financially before being dismissed following a poor start to the previous campaign.",
      "In essence, the board's stance combines conviction with conditional loyalty. Amorim continues to enjoy strong institutional support, but it is tethered to visible progress. Faith in the 40-year-old remains, but it won't take an much for that faith to be eroded.",
      "Grade: B",
      "Given the turmoil surrounding both Amorim and United over the past year, his media handling has been commendably assured. He has projected honesty, composure and accountability, facing difficult questions head-on without resorting to evasion or empty rhetoric. Even amid scrutiny, Amorim has defended his players and tactics with measured conviction, maintaining a calm, grounded demeanour throughout.",
      "The criticisms are relatively minor. He lacks the charisma and showmanship of some of his predecessors and can occasionally appear reserved or disengaged under the media glare. But these are minor quibbles in the context of his overall professionalism. Amorim's clarity, composure and refusal to inflame controversy have earned him quiet respect - both within the club and among the press.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Grade: C",
      "Amorim's future at Manchester United hangs in a delicate balance. Recent improvements - including a string of three successive league wins - suggest the team is beginning to find its rhythm, displaying greater tactical cohesion and resilience. For the first time in months, United no longer look adrift, and there are tentative signs that Amorim's methods are finally taking hold.",
      "If this trajectory continues, that C could quickly rise to a B, especially as United edge closer to re-entering the top-four conversation. But vulnerabilities persist. The squad still lacks the quality and consistency of genuine contenders and another sustained dip in form could test the board's patience and place Amorim's position under renewed threat.",
      "Ultimately, his prospects are promising but precarious. Amorim has laid the groundwork for improvement, but his long-term future depends on whether he can turn glimpses of progress into sustained success. For now, time - and results - will be the ultimate judge.",

      "Manchester United are riding the high of three rare victories on the bounce ahead of this weekend’s Premier League fixture. Recent wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have marked Ruben Amorim’s best spell since he took the reins exactly a year ago.",
      "The Red Devils will be hoping that form continues when they make the trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. Amorim will be well aware that Forest have struggled all season long and a win over a team that recently appointed their third manager of the campaign will take them even beyond their current sixth-place standing.",
      "Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has revealed how impressed he has been with Marcus Rashford since the United loanee’s move to Spain in the summer. The forward, 28, has scored five goals and notched another seven assists in 13 games already this season for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "Rashford has made no secret of the fact he wants to secure a permanent move to Barcelona at the end of this season. And he appears to be on the right path, with Szczesny providing a glimpse into how Rashford has been carrying himself in training and in matches.",
      "\"He's an excellent player, I love him a lot,\" he said. \"Direct in his play, attacks with speed, and he's contributed to a lot of goals. I think he's a complete player, and I remember him since he was 18 or 19 in the Premier League. I knew he was special back then.\"",
      "The Polish goalkeeper added: \"He has fewer goals than he deserves, because in training, when he's having a good day, you can't stop him. If he shows that magical right foot more in matches, he'll be very dangerous.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has shed light on the best advice Sir Alex Ferguson ever gave him. The striker played under the former Old Trafford boss for nine years, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League.",
      "Despite a sometimes strained relationship, there is no doubt that the Scot played a crucial role in developing Rooney into the legendary striker he became. And the BBC pundit has now recalled one memorable conversation he had with Sir Alex during his career that sticks with him today.",
      "Rooney said on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show: ”I always remember the one thing he said and he said it a few times, ‘The hardest thing to do in life is work hard.’ That stuck with me. Whatever job you're doing, that can apply to anything really.",
      "“I think in football we have talent, we have ability, but sometimes we don't look at working hard every day. And you'd think that's normal. You should do that if you play at a big club. But some players don't. And so that was the one thing which stuck with me.”",
      "Former United star Nani has refused to rule Amorim’s side out of the title race this season. The 38-year-old former winger, who won four league titles in his seven seasons with the club, made the hugely optimistic comment in light of the Red Devils’ recent form.",
      "Discussing a potential title charge, he told Covers.com: “Why not? They are building a strong team and are trying to get back into real competition with the teams that are always at the top of the table: Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Man City.",
      "\"So, they are there now. They have the possibility. If they win the next few games, everything can change. So, we never know. Let’s keep on winning games and then we’ll see.”",
      "Given that they are already six points off leaders Arsenal, predicting a title push this season seems somewhat premature, but Nani claims the lack of European football could aid his former side. The Portuguese added: “If it’s not this year, maybe they will get the confidence for next season. So, let’s see.",
      "“Not being in Europe helps on one side, yes, but obviously everyone likes to see the team in European competitions because in the middle of the week, when you don’t see your team there, you get frustrated.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The East Midlands outfit suffered their maiden league defeat under new boss Sean Dyche - a 2-0 defeat to high-flying Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "United are displaying encouraging signs of improvement under Ruben Amorim, chalking up three successive victories - their first such run since between May to August 2024. The positive atmosphere has returned to Old Trafford as they occupy sixth position in the standings.",
      "Nevertheless, Heskey reckons the immediate target for United should be clinching a top-eight spot in the Premier League. Discussing their recent upturn in form, Heskey told Dream Vegas: \"He [Amorim] adapted to the way he needed to play against Liverpool, so it looks like he's understanding a bit more the squad and understanding a bit more the players and understanding a bit more the league as well.",
      "\"I do believe that they see something in him that they believe is long-term, so I don't see them sacking him. The next step is probably top eight, and then just keep putting their foot on the pedal and moving up the table to where they believe a club of the stature of Manchester United should be.",
      "\"They should be challenging in the top four eventually, but at this moment, they're miles off that. The next step top eight and then get top six. I think that's a successful season for me.\"",
      "Amorim has been under the microscope throughout his time at Old Trafford, but a trio of vital victories appear to have temporarily quelled doubts about his role.",
      "\"It was a journey, a big journey,\" Amorim reflected on his inaugural year at the helm. \"It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments.",
      "\"I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago.",

You stuck to your system and it's working.",

I would love to see them emerge from this dark horse position because nobody gave them a dime to do anything this season.",

      "Manchester United minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe was reportedly left unimpressed by the list of candidates for his previous managerial decision. Ruben Amorim is nearing the one-year mark of his tenure at Old Trafford and, almost exactly 12 months on, he's finally hitting his stride as the club's head coach.",
      "The appointment from Sporting CP was made with Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox in the hierarchy but Ashworth, the former Newcastle United chief, left the club abruptly shortly after Amorim's arrival. Despite facing pressure at points last season and during the current campaign, the Portuguese tactician has weathered the storm to guide United to three consecutive wins and on the brink of the top four.",
      "However, it could have been a different story according to The Guardian, a Premier League shortlist was drawn up which featured Eddie Howe, Graham Potter and Thomas Frank. The report adds that suggestions over Gareth Southgate's prospects to become the man in the Old Trafford hotseat were played down by United sources.",
      "The former England manager was also linked as a potential replacement for Amorim recently. As was Newcastle boss Howe.",
      "Reports suggest that Ratcliffe deemed the shortlist \"uninspiring\" as he turned to Ashworth for a definitive roster of potential successors. Yet the report indicates that Erik Ten Hag's struggles and the hunt for his replacement sparked a revelation from United's chief that Ashworth wasn't the figure he envisioned spearheading the club's future.",
      "The ex-Newcastle sporting director allegedly advised against making a bold appointment and presented a catalogue of Premier League contenders before United plumped for Amorim. Following the Europa League final defeat last season and a dismal Premier League star, plus the stunning Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town, speculation intensified around the 40-year-old's prospects.",
      "Nevertheless there has been a revival in fortunes and it arrives just weeks after Ratcliffe spoke openly to back Amorim and dismiss suggestions he might face the managerial axe. \"He has not had the best of seasons,\" he told The Business podcast.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be. The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success.",

      "Should United pick up their fourth successive victory, it will be the first time since February 2024 that they have done so. Forest’s last win in the Premier League came on the opening day of the season at home to Brentford.",

      "Nobody will be getting ahead of themselves if that does happen but what a turnaround it would be for Amorim if that was to be the case, even if just a few hours. But underestimate the hosts at your peril, they will be keen to do well for their new boss today.",
      "After being a surprise inclusion in the matchday squad to face Brighton, Malacia is the man who drops out to allow Maguire back in. The Dutchman was the only member of the 'bomb squad' to not leave in the summer.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and it is expected that he will depart Old Trafford when it does, if not before.",
      "Amorim names an unchanged team after winning against Brighton, which is a sensible decision after a strong performance. Maguire is back in the ground after recovering from a knock.",
      "Malacia has dropped out of the matchday squad to make way for Maguire, but that won’t make any headlines. Amorim looked in high spirits when he arrived and he high fived a young United fan.",

      "Marinakis made a mess when he confronted Nuno on the pitch and the appointment of Postecoglou was a disaster. Dyche should keep Forest in the league and he seems like a sensible appointment.",
      "Dyche writes in his programme notes:",
      "The atmosphere in our last home game was truly special, and we can only thank you for that. To have the City Ground bursting with noise as it was only shows how special our club is and underlines how lucky we are to have you backing us every week, no matter the occasion or opponent.",
      "Forest have won just one league game against Brentford. They have suffered six defeats this season and their fans haven’t had much to cheer about, but they will be up for the visit of United today.",
      "It makes sense for Amorim to name an unchanged team this afternoon. Mount was named on the bench last weekend and will likely have a role to play in the second half of this game.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Maguire is fit enough to make the squad after picking up a knock in training. United are officially an in-form team after three wins on the bounce and must keep building momentum, so naming the same starting line-up is logical.",
      "It’s the one-year anniversary of Amorim’s appointment today. Amorim was in a reflective mood during his pre-match press conference and described taking the United job as the “best decision of his life.”",
      "Amorim was upbeat when he arrived to speak to journalists, and a weight appears to have been removed from his shoulders after an excellent October. Amorim needs to keep winning games, though.",
      "The wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton were excellent, but you are expected to win successive matches regularly at United.",
      "The form guide points in only one direction this afternoon with United the team in great form going into this one. However, at 3pm, it will be on United to make their good recent record count.",

      "We will bring you all of the build-up, updates and reaction right here so stay tuned.",
      "United are in a good position in terms of who is available today. Martinez is the only definite absentee as he enters the final stages of recovery from an ACL injury.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live United matchday blog as the Reds travel to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's men approach this game as favourites. Their three successive victories have boosted confidence around the United team and their hosts have not won in the Premier League since the opening day of the season.",
      "However, writing off Forest could be unwise considering Dyche won his first and only match at the City Ground as manager in the Europa League just over a week ago.",
      "Stay tuned for all the updates and analysis from the game..."

      "Ruben Amorim warned that the storm was coming after his Manchester United appointment, but the dark clouds have lifted above Old Trafford and brighter days seem to be ahead.",
      "United have won three Premier League games on the bounce and Amorim has been nominated for October's manager of the month award. The victory against Liverpool at Anfield felt like it could be a tenure-defining result, and United built on that performance by securing three points against Brighton last weekend.",
      "It's the one-year anniversary of Amorim's appointment from Sporting Lisbon today, and the 40-year-old will try to mark the occasion by winning away against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at Carrington on Thursday and discussed his first 12 months in Manchester. \"We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is like this,\" he said when asked whether the storm he predicted would come had passed.",
      "\"And we are not that team that I can say to you, now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust my players more, I think they trust me more. That will come with wins.",
      "\"You can sense that, because everyone now is saying that, 'Oh, connected they are, and they believe in the manager'. It's about winning games, it didn't change a lot, because against Arsenal I saw the same thing.",
      "\"So I don't know. I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always without feeling and prepared that something can change. If we have that feeling, we will be more... We will pay attention to the details, we will maintain that course of our path. I can say that we are a better team in this moment.\"",
      "When asked whether there had been any moments when he doubted he would last a year in the job, Amorim said: \"It's hard to say that. Sometimes in some moments... I know that you are going to write [laughs]... But there were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games, that was so hard for me, because this is Manchester United.",
      "\"The position that we had in the last year, putting all the attention on Europa League and not winning, that was massive. So I had some moments that I struggled a lot.",
      "\"And I was thinking that maybe it's not meant to be. Today is the opposite. So you can write this one. Today I feel that, and I know that, that was the best decision in my life, and I want to be here.\"",
      "Amorim has remained upbeat even during the tough moments. \"It's also my character, and then sometimes it's also... I know that a lot of people want to see me arriving here with that face that I'm suffering, and I like to do the opposite, sometimes I think about that,\" he said.",
      "\"But it's the way of seeing things. So I said, since the first moment, this will not change who I am, and I'm like that, and I live my life like this, and I know that football will change in some moment, and now we are in a good moment, but I'm always with that feeling here that something can change.",
      "\"So I try to balance my life, but you can say that I laugh a lot, but you also can say that I'm always like [lowers his head] this on the bench, and like this [pretends to be exasperated], so I just live with emotions, and I follow my team. If my team is playing well and running a lot, I will be a happy man.\"",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has refused to tweak his system, despite intense scrutiny. Is he tempted to turn around and say 'I told you so' after an excellent October?",
      "\"No, because I know that in two weeks this could change again,\" he said. \"And you will say, 'No, no, we were right,' so it's like a crazy conversation. I just have a clear idea how I want to do things, I'm always saying the same thing.",
      "\"For me, it's a 3-4-3 that we are going to change against different opponents, so I just need time, like every manager. Maybe my way of doing things is going to take more time, for people to start seeing things.",
      "\"And that manager that arrives in one club, in the next four games they can win three and lose one, but then there's also luck in the games, again, we had some luck against Liverpool, and all the narrative changed because of that, so I understand football, I just do what I feel is the best thing for the team and for the club.\"",
      "Amorim added on his formation: \"I think the rotation of the team is easier for me, because I spend so much time thinking about that. I don't see it as a 3-4-3, I see it at the beginning, at the base of the idea of 3-4-3.",
      "\"Because I spend a lot of time playing like that, because when I start thinking about the system, nobody was playing 3-4-3, so I can understand how to rotate players, even in the way we buy players.",
      "\"If you have a clear idea how to play, it's easy for you to point, this is the guy that I want. And that can help you. When you have today is 4-3-3, and then tomorrow is 4-4-2, it's harder to make the characteristics right for the players, so I try to use all this knowledge to search for the right players.\"",
      "Although Amorim discussed bringing in players for his system, he played down plans for the January transfer window. \"I don't know what is going to happen,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of things can happen. Even in our club, and you know that we have the World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.",
      "\"And then we want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United. We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"So I don't know what is going to happen, but of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "United's direct approach was effective against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, and Amorim was asked whether that was an example of his tactics evolving. \"I also don't believe that we have a style that we have to build up always from the back,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"We want to build up to push the opponents to have space to score goals. If the space is there, if the numbers are there, if there is three against three in front, and I have Ben [Sesko], [Matheus] Cunha, for example, and Bryan [Mbeumo] I will put the ball in two passes, I want to score goals in two passes.",
      "\"But sometimes you have to build up. What I try to teach my players is which kind of game I need to play in this situation. That is my job, I don't want to teach my players to build up with a lot of touches and then bring it.",
      "\"If you need a lot of touches, you will understand that you need a lot of touches. If you need one, put the ball, because the fans want to see a different game. We are in England, I try to show you a little bit of English football in the past.",
      "\"It's [not] that I don't have a clear way of building up, I just look at the space, the number of players, the characteristics of my players and try to use that to win games.\"",
      "Amorim urged his players to reproduce their Old Trafford performances when playing away this season. \"When we play at home we are more intense, we are more focused, our fans help us a lot, when we have an opportunity you can feel the stadium helping us to control the game,\" he said.",
      "\"But when we play away, it's different. The fans are not there for us, against Brentford we were not so intense, our recovery was not so good, against Fulham we lost control of the game when we were winning, and we show a different team, that we are a different team playing in our home.",
      "\"So it's not a technical thing, it's not a tactical thing, we need to play a different style, we just need to be the same team, to believe in the same way that we do at home. We need to show that away.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Lisandro Martinez is the only player certain to miss the game. However, he is back in training after an ACL injury. Harry Maguire remains a doubt having missed the clash with Brighton.",
      "Here's how our United writers think United should line up against Forest:",
      "Steven Railston",
      "There is no need to change the starting line-up after last weekend's win against Brighton. Amorim should make no changes and continue with the players who were responsible for that 4-2 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro has become an important player again and should start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the centre of midfield. Amad is developing an excellent understanding with Bryan Mbeumo down the right.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came close to scoring against Brighton and should have chances to find the net against a struggling Forest side.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "Amorim said before the Liverpool game that he did not pick Sesko as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate enjoy the aerial battle. Forest's centre-back pairing of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will be very similar so there's no harm in adopting the striker-less tactic again.",
      "Mount is fit again and while Sesko did well at home to Brighton, he is the obvious player to drop out.",
      "Doubts surrounding Maguire's fitness mean Leny Yoro should be guaranteed a start again this weekend. A nervy moment up against Yankuba Minteh aside, he had a good game against Brighton so deserves to keep his place.",

      "Paul Scholes' daughter, Alicia, has shown her unconditional support for her dad after he opened up on caring for his autistic son Aiden.",
      "The Manchester United icon, who has split from his wife Claire, revealed he stepped away from his punditry work on live TV this season to focus on caring for and spending more time with his 20-year-old autistic son. \"I made a decision this year because of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about,\" Scholes told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"All the work I do now is just around his routines because he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do it is around Aiden. We always do the same things with him as he doesn't know what day of the week it is or time.",
      "\"But he'll know from what we're doing what day it is. I pick him up every Tuesday from his daycare and we go swimming. Loves swimming then we get his pizza on the way home. Thursday pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate. So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",
      "Alicia turned to Instagram to commend her father's bravery in discussing her brother's situation. She posted: \"I've never known anyone hate talking about themselves more than you! I can only imagine how hard it was to speak about Aidie and the reality of a very very hard situation.",
      "\"My whole life your priority has always been being my dad, and growing up and realising how hard you had to work everyday alongside that is something I can't even comprehend. To achieve all you did takes so much sacrifice and hard work and somehow I still had you to take me to school every morning and be there at the end of each day, so present in every aspect of my life!",
      "\"If anyone met you they wouldn't have a clue the life you've lived, they'd just see a genuinely kind, polite, caring person. You don't care about people who don't matter, and out of everything that is the most valuable thing i have learnt from you. The thing I am proudest of is being your daughter, you are the best role model and father figure I could ever have, and you do it so effortlessly.",
      "\"Anyway well done on this episode dad it was amazing and if Aidie could tell you himself he would say you really are the best dad in the world, we love you millions.\"",

He's also improved his forward play, scoring goals, connecting with the team, and moving forward with the ball. He’s become a complete player in his position.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana's form since moving to Trabzonspor in September has been described as \"outstanding\".",
      "Onana was allowed to leave Old Trafford in the summer after Senne Lammens arrived at Old Trafford. After defeat to Fenerbahce on his Trabzonspor debut, Onana has not lost since.",
      "His side are currently on a four-game winning run which has lifted them to second in the table ahead of Saturday's trip to league leaders Galatasaray. Ahead of that match, MEN Sport spoke to Trabzonspor sports reporter Hasan Tuncel to discuss Onana's time at the Turkish club so far.",
      "\"In one word: outstanding,\" Tuncel said when asked how Onana had fared in his early months at the club. \"Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "\"A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out - he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.",
      "\"From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "\"His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal - he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "\"So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "\"He personally mentors three young goalkeepers — Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak — guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.\"",
      "Tuncel admitted the reaction to Onana's arrival within the Trabzonspor fanbase was one of caution. Onana represented a significant investment for the club and his woes at United had been well-documented in Turkey.",
      "However, the welcome he received upon his arrival was on a different scale to high-profile signings of the past. \"In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion - but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,\" he explained.",
      "\"We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "\"Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: 'Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.' That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "\"Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster - and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.\"",
      "There is a sense that Onana has found the right environment to thrive but the chances of him signing permanently look to be slim. \"The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,\" Tuncel admitted.",
      "\"However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "\"For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and help them grow. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would definitely love to keep him permanently.\"",

      "Lammens signed for United on transfer deadline day for £18.2million from Royal Antwerp, but Ruben Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir for three Premier League games following his arrival.",
      "Amorim finally gave Lammens his debut against Sunderland earlier this month. The 23-year-old made a strong first impression, recording a clean sheet, and has retained his starting role since.",
      "The United boss explained that Lammens needed time to adapt in training at Carrington before his first appearance, and the Belgian stopper agreed with that assessment.",
      "Speaking about the decision to delay his debut, Lammens told BBC Sport: \"There was nothing said before about there being a strict plan. It was always 'the best goalkeeper will play'.",
      "\"But at the start, I had a little bit of difficulty in training. The manager saw that and gave me a little bit of time to adapt. The first game I played was the perfect opportunity for me. From there everything went well. I couldn't have imagined a better start.\"",
      "United fans chanted 'are you Schmeichel in disguise?' at Lammens on his debut. \"I don't listen to it too much during the game, but I saw it afterwards,\" he said about the chant.",
      "\"I'm not Schmeichel in disguise. I am just Senne Lammens trying to help the team. It is an amazing compliment to get, but you have to be realistic. He is one of the best goalkeepers ever. I have to prove a lot more to be in the same conversation as him. I want to have a long career here.",
      "\"Then, maybe in the end, I can be in the conversation with people like Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and [David] De Gea. That would be really nice.\"",
      "Lammens added on his start at United: \"Of course, you hear from other people there is a lot of pressure coming here and playing for this team. But I welcome that. Firstly, it is nice you can play for such a big team. There should be a lot of pressure. I'm not really scared of it.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about tactics but it is not about that. It is about the way we play and the intensity. It is also about being realistic and knowing, against Liverpool, it won't be the prettiest game in terms of build-up. It was more about being direct and playing for the second balls.",
      "\"If we are high up the pitch, with the players we have, we can always make it difficult for the opponent. It is also not making it too difficult for ourselves. Building from the back can sometimes hurt you more than it helps.",
      "\"I have been trying not to take too many risks and trusting the qualities of the guys up front and in midfield. Sometimes we need to get the ball there as fast as possible.\"",
      "Lammens also discussed his relationship with United's defenders, revealing that Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt had told him what they expected to see from him. \"They told me I don't need to be the most amazing or special goalkeeper, just to be there in important moments to give the team trust,\" he said.",
      "\"It makes them more relaxed knowing someone is behind them who can help them. One of the key points of a goalkeeper is helping the defence with communication.",
      "\"I am proud of being calm and collected. But when the time is needed, I can be harsh or shout at teammates. To have both characteristics is good.\"",

      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",

      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Sancho joined Man Utd for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but has only rediscovered his best form when back on loan at the Bundesliga side, with his displays for Manchester United, Chelsea on loan last season and now for Aston Villa falling way short of that peak.",
      "He’s made just five appearances for Villa since joining them in the summer and suffered the embarrassment of being substituted in last weekend’s victory over Manchester City having been introduced as a sub in the 29th minute.",
      "Asked about the winger’s disappointing form, Shearer said: “I don’t know what’s going on with Jadon Sancho in terms of his training or his life, but he’s got an opportunity at Villa now, and if it doesn’t work out here, people will look back and say, ‘Hang on, you’ve been given so many opportunities.’ You can only have so many.",
      "“I guess it is humiliating when you’re put on as a sub and then taken off again. It hasn’t worked out yet for him, but there’s only one way around it and that is hard work.",
      "“Get your head down, get your attitude right, and if you do that, things will turn around.”",
      "Aston Villa head to Anfield on Saturday night, and Shearer has backed Unai Emery’s side to plunge Liverpool into further crisis, but explained why he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the hosts win.",
      "“You’ve got one team in terrible form, losing six of their last seven, and one team in really good form winning six of their last seven. There’s an argument for both sides. It really is a massive game, but particularly with the way Liverpool were defeated in midweek,” Shearer added.",
      "“Liverpool can’t afford another defeat and if that does happen, then the alarm bells will really start to ring. I don’t know what to expect from Liverpool, there’s part of me that thinks it can’t continue this run, because they’ve got that much quality.",

      "Signing a dynamic midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “genuine interest” in Conor Gallagher, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro’s uptick in form – evidenced by United conceding just three goal with him on the pitch and 16 goals without him – has made the requirement for a new central midfielder feel less urgent than it was even a couple of weeks ago, but that remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insists recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, it’s hard to imagine how he would get into Amorim’s team to make that difference.",

      "But Gallagher is no alternative for Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 63 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to Romano, Gallagher remains very much on United’s radar.",
      "“I told you several times that Man United want to add a midfielder, but in this moment to go for a very expensive midfielder in the January transfer window might be difficult,” Romano told CaughtOffside.",
      "“Players like (Carlos) Baleba maybe are not even available. Same for Angelo Stiller and then there could be opportunities – a name that Manchester United considered in the summer transfer window final days was Connor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid.",
      "“Conor Gallagher remains an option in case Atletico Madrid decide to open doors to a loan move. At the moment Gallagher is only focused on Atletico Madrid. Manchester United’s interest is genuine since August. But Gallagher is one of the options they have in case it could be an opportunity on loan, in case it can be a typical general deal.",
      "“So we will be following the situation. But Gallagher is a name we have to keep there.”",

      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; in the same ‘safe pair of hands’ category as Mason Mount. He’s started just four games for Atletico this season.",
      "There will be huge doubts as to whether he’s a player who can take Man Utd forward, but above all, questions as to how he would even get in their team.",

      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. Conor Gallagher is not that man.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "At times it looked like it wouldn’t happen, but Ruben Amorim has made it to a year in charge of Manchester United.",
      "After the sacking of Erik ten Hag, Man Utd announced on November 1 last year that Amorim would become their new head coach, starting work 10 days later once he finished his Sporting CP tenure. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for Amorim at Old Trafford since then.",
      "Only recently has the Portuguese tactician been able to steer United towards consecutive positive results in the Premier League. They finished 15th under his watch last season and simply have to keep improving from here.",
      "To give themselves a decent chance, they boosted their squad in the summer with a handful of new signings. But their work evolving Amorim’s squad isn’t yet complete.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested Amorim will be given three years to prove himself, so if the co-owner keeps his word, the head coach will still be in situ this time next year too, ready to celebrate a second anniversary of his appointment.",
      "With two transfer windows to go before then, what might Man Utd’s best XI look like this time next year?",
      "Disappointed by the performances of Andre Onana, United faced a goalkeeping transfer dilemma this summer. Ultimately, they chose to look to the future and signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Amorim has been patient with the Belgian so far, but he is starting to look like his new first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Altay Bayindir.",
      "Next summer, United will need to work out what to do with Onana after his loan spell at Trabzonspor, but it’s unlikely they’d be reverting to him as a starter.",
      "As long as Lammens doesn’t make too many mistakes over the course of the season, he looks set to be entrusted with the regular starting duties in goal for the long term, having signed a contract until 2030.",
      "There could yet be scope for a more senior keeper to come in and replace him, with Bayindir then making way, but United will be managing their budget carefully and assessing what they’ve already got first.",
      "The defender that United hope will be one of their figureheads for many years, Yoro has been settling into a role on the right-hand side of a back three.",
      "After beating competition from Real Madrid to sign the Frenchman last year, United tied him down to a long-term contract until 2029.",
      "Comfortable on either side of the back three that Amorim favours, Yoro can carve out a defined future for himself on his more natural right-hand side.",
      "Despite joining United to link up with his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, De Ligt has become a cornerstone of Amorim’s lineups recently.",
      "Generally, the Dutch defender has been stationed as the central defender in the back three, not missing a minute so far this Premier League season.",
      "At the age of 26, the once highly-touted De Ligt is approaching what should be the prime of his career, and it seems as if he’s stabilising his form in time to enjoy it in a settled role with United.",
      "DON’T MISS – The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "Upgrading at left centre-back would be a luxury for United rather than a necessity, depending on how Lisandro Martinez recovers from his latest injury setback.",
      "He has every chance of fighting for his place, but it can’t be denied that a dream target for United remains Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "So far, they’ve failed to prise him away, with Everton securing him to a new contract in the summer. However, there will reportedly be a release clause active in 2026.",
      "The price will be high, but if United find it reasonable enough and can afford it, the pathway to their dream signing could finally be cleared.",
      "If Branthwaite is out of reach, though, Martinez will likely continue as the main left-sided centre-back.",
      "Although he can also be an option in behind the striker, Amad has gained more gametime as a right wing-back so far this season.",
      "While he’s definitely more ‘wing’ than ‘back’, he has the traits to make that role his own niche in Amorim’s system.",
      "Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui will likely still be around as more defensive options, but at the age of 23, Amad is ready to take the next steps up in his career and will be aiming to put the pressure on for regular starts by virtue of his performances.",
      "United are dreaming of a midfield transformation in 2026, with sources explaining their plan to sign two new players in the department – ideally one in January and one in the summer.",
      "The preference at first would be someone with Premier League experience, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson on the shortlist.",
      "But Baleba struggled to impress at Old Trafford when visiting with Brighton recently and Forest’s valuation of Anderson is extremely high.",
      "TEAMtalk’s Dean Jones recently named Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton as the player suspected to be the preferred target for United as things stand, although he won’t be easy to buy either.",
      "One of the best English midfielders in the Premier League, Wharton originally hails from Lancashire and could return to the north west with United if they get their way.",
      "A player who can dictate the tempo like he can would be a major boost to Amorim’s midfield, where Manuel Ugarte is struggling to convince, Kobbie Mainoo is unfavoured and Casemiro isn’t getting any younger.",
      "The other midfielder United could face a serious dilemma over next year is their captain, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The role Amorim has been using him in recently doesn’t get the best out of him, but on paper, he remains one of United’s best players – if not the best.",
      "Fernandes has vowed not to make a decision on his club future until after the World Cup, but there’s reportedly a clause in his contract that could lead to him leaving for a foreign club.",
      "Should United get their wish of signing a second midfielder, one candidate who has been heavily tipped for a move is Stuttgart’s Germany international, Stiller.",
      "Jason Wilcox is said to be driving United’s interest in the 24-year-old, who would be more likely to move next summer than in January.",
      "He won’t be too pricey, either, since his release clause will stand at around £35m.",
      "The left wing-back role is starting to stand out as one United could do with an upgrade in. If only they still had Alvaro Carreras…",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first signing of the Amorim era but the step up from Lecce to Man Utd is substantial and the jury is still out on whether he’ll make it as a success.",
      "Come 2026, there could be scope for United to strengthen with a more senior left-back.",
      "Right now, it’s too early to nail down who the candidates could be. There have been links with Inter’s Federico Dimarco, but he wants to stay with his boyhood club.",
      "Someone else who’s been namechecked in the media is Fulham’s Antonee Robinson, who would bring some proven Premier League quality.",
      "That said, he will turn 29 next summer and still with two years of contract remaining, so it remains to be seen if United would still see him as an ideal profile.",
      "Their scouts will have to keep their eyes on which players emerge as standout left wing-backs over the course of the season before making a more informed decision.",
      "United transformed their attack this summer with three new signings who should set them up for the next few years.",
      "Of the new triple threat, the player who’s made the better early impression has been Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford to become the new right-sided attacking midfielder in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape.",
      "From his first 10 games, Mbeumo has scored five goals for United. He’s still only 26, so if he can keep this up, he should be a threat over the coming years.",
      "Man Utd stars Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, manager Ruben Amorim",
      "Operating alongside Mbeumo and in behind the main striker is Cunha, who has been more of a slow burner since his switch from Wolves.",
      "It took until his ninth appearance for Cunha to score his first goal for United, but now that he’s broken his duck, he’ll be aiming to make more of an impact.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Cunha arrived with Premier League experience and is 26 years old, expecting to spend his prime years at Old Trafford.",
      "United capped off their attacking rebuild by signing Sesko as their new centre-forward, deciding against going for a more experienced option.",
      "It’s now over to the Slovenian to showcase his worth and justify United’s decision to pick out a player with long-term potential up front, just as they tried with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee before only to be underwhelmed.",
      "Sesko has only scored twice from his first 10 games for United, but time will be on his side to step up – and besides, he arrived on the back of better seasons than Hojlund or Zirkzee before their moves.",
      "If Sesko doesn’t hit the mark, there might be calls for United to sign a more proven goalscorer – in fact, they might need a reliable veteran to back him up anyway, moving Zirkzee on – but this season will be practically all his to solidify his status.",

      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Manchester United boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the Red Devils’ initial six-man shortlist.",
      "Amorim is slowly starting to turn things around at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League games on the bounce to lift them above Liverpool and into sixth place in the table, having been on the verge of the sack for the majority of his Old Trafford career to that point having been appointed last November.",
      "He became the club’s priority candidate after Erik ten Hag’s poor start to last season, after the Dutchman was handed a contract extension on the back of winning the FA Cup.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since admitted it was a mistake to retain Ten Hag, and a report from The Athletic has detailed the process in that summer when he signed a new deal which saw the Man Utd chiefs scour the managerial market to identify a replacement, which very nearly saw De Zerbi take the reins at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s claimed their analysis of candidates at the time was focused on them ‘playing an attacking 4-3-3 system’ similar to the one used by Ten Hag, and there was ‘an emphasis on previous Premier League experience’.",
      "It led them to draw up a six-man shortlist featuring Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "‘Informal contact was made with all of them’ but Tuchel and De Zerbi were ‘the prime candidates’, with Amorim not considered owing to his tactical system and lack of Premier League experience.",

Tuchel came across incredibly well, but no terms were agreed and the German wasn’t ready for the United job. He was to take a short break from football after a difficult time at Bayern Munich that led to him leaving that club only the previous month.",
      "‘So De Zerbi became the frontrunner, and financial terms were discussed with the Italian in line with what United felt was fair. Those terms were rejected, and the club chose not to improve them.’",
      "In the end, Man Utd stuck with Ten Hag having failed to agree terms with a manager they deemed suitable to take over at the time, before ripping up their blueprint following his poor start to the campaign and plumping for a man with no Premier League experience, who plays a completely different formation in Amorim.",

      "“Then they have a realistic chance of top six, top seven, maybe even top four if they have an amazing run, but I don’t think so because they are heavily reliant on a couple of the front boys.”",
      "Murphy has also argued that Man Utd’s wing-backs need to do “more”, with the pundit pointing the finger at Amad Diallo, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who have had the most minutes on the flanks this season.",
      "“I still think they could get a bit more from their wing-backs,” Murphy added.",
      "“When I think of teams who have played that system and been really successful, wing-backs have done really well.",
      "“When Chelsea won the league playing that 3-4-3, they had Alonso and Moses both chipping in with goals and assists regularly.",
      "“I like Dalot, he’s a talent, but is he really a wing-back? He’s a right-footer playing at left wing-back.”",
      "When asked how they could do more, Murphy continued: “Goals and assists. If you’re playing wing-back, you are getting in great areas, you really are. I’m not talking double figures but they need to chip in [with goals and assists].”",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy revealed who he thinks will win the Premier League and Champions League this season as one club is at a “different level” to Arsenal.",

      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Manchester United exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Onana joined Man Utd from Inter Milan for £47m in the summer of 2023 but was allowed to leave the club in September after his less than convincing displays for the Red Devils last season.",
      "A four-game winning run has moved Trabzonspor into second place in the Turkish Super Lig and Onana hasn’t tasted defeat for his new club since his debut loss against Fenerbahce.",
      "And Trabzonspor correspondent Hasan Tuncel was full of praise for the 29-year-old when asked for his assessment of his performances, describing his contribution as “flawless”.",
      "“In one word: outstanding,” Tuncel said. “Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "“A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out – he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.”",
      "“From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "“His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal – he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "“So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "“He personally mentors three young goalkeepers – Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak – guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.”",

      "On how Onana was welcomed to the club, Tuncel added: “In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion – but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,” he revealed.",
      "“We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "“Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.’ That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "“Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster – and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.”",
      "Despite Onana’s excellent form, it’s unlikely Trabzonspor will have the wherewithal to complete his permanent signing",
      "Tuncel continued: “The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,” Tuncel admitted.",
      "“However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "“For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and aid their development. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would certainly love to keep him on a permanent basis.”",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United squad was ‘relieved’ to see Andre Onana leave the club for one reason, according to a report.",

      "They’ve won a few trophies and there were some good times under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Erik ten Hag, along with other glimmers of joy, but the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the sinking Old Trafford ship while Liverpool simultaneously plunge into crisis has created a satisfaction stew which might just have made October 2025 the most enjoyable month for a Manchester United fan since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out in support of Amorim when reports of his sacking and talk of possible replacements were still rife despite a face-saving victory over Sunderland at the start of the month.",
      "The co-owner said he needed three years at Old Trafford to prove he’s a “great” coach; we gave him three weeks, still wholly unconvinced both by Amorim’s ability to turn things around and by the veracity of Ratcliffe’s backing of a manager with the worst record of any Man Utd boss since the halcyon Fergie days. But what a three weeks it’s been.",
      "Having incredibly failed to win consecutive Premier League games since joining the club last November, Amorim’s now won three(?!) on the bounce, with victory over fourth-placed Sunderland followed by their first win at Anfield in nearly a decade and then their latest triumph, over Brighton.",
      "And they were proper wins too, featuring some tactical nuance, game management, surprising confidence and some outstanding performances from summer signings to shift the narrative in dramatic fashion, to the point where we’re wondering what’s stopping United from qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "No midweek football thanks to the Europa League final and Grimsby Town defeats, while meaning scant opportunity for backups like Kobbie Mainoo, is granting Amorim plenty of time on the training ground with the players to hone ideas and implement a philosophy which they now appear to be finally getting to grips with.",
      "Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal and Casemiro’s rejuvenation has, at least for the time being, put a stop to claims Amorim and United were doomed to perpetual false dawns at best until they signed a new No.6. Rumours of interest in Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and others have been conspicuous by their absence in the last couple of weeks.",
      "The centre-backs are all playing well, with the question now not which three are less likely to screw up but which in-form defender Amorim should leave out. Lisandro Martinez’s return looks set to raise those standards even higher.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are doing excellent work in relieving the creative pressure on the shoulders of Bruno Fernandes, who looks increasingly like the leader of Man Utd rather than a guy whining while wearing an armband.",
      "And although the jury may still be out on Benjamin Sesko, it’s testament to the work of his fellow forwards that he’s being allowed the space to ease into life in the Premier League rather than being harangued for not scoring regular goals as Rasmus Hojlund was.",
      "It’s all going swimmingly for them, and whether because of some mystical requirement for one of the two greatest English teams to be in crisis at any one time, or simply thanks to a glorious twisting of fates for the Red Devils, the aversion of their club emergency has coincided with Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming fully fledged in October.",
      "It’s seen the Reds lose three Premier League games before dumped out of the Carabao Cup, making it six defeats in seven. Mohamed Salah has lost it. Virgil van Dijk might just be past it. Their two £100m+ players have been stratospheric flops. And Arne Slot, while making excuses that would make Jurgen Klopp or Arsene Wenger blush having been a beacon of objectivity last season, is now second in the sack race. Amorim is eighth.",
      "Having been eight points behind Liverpool after five games, after nine Man Utd are above them. And while we can’t yet know whether October 2025 will act as a line in the sand, the point when Amorim’s Man Utd truly discovered their identity before going on to great things while Slot’s Liverpool scrabbled to recover theirs to no avail before his sacking, there’s no doubt that it’s been a standout month for Red Devils fans in the post-Sir Alex era; maybe the most enjoyable of all.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, leaving Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner and Nuno Espirito Santo in clear and present danger of losing his second job of the season, and title-winning Arne Slot a genuine contender as the Liverpool crisis deepens further.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It’s now six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competition. Slot and Liverpool simply have to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",

      "\"It's hard to say that. Sometimes, in some moments,\" he said. \"There were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games. That was so hard for me because this is Manchester United.",

      "In a statement explaining why there is only one Boxing Day fixture this season, the Premier League said: \"There are now several challenges to Premier League fixture scheduling rooted in the expansion of European club competitions - which led to a revision of our domestic calendar ahead of last season, including changes to the FA Cup.",
      "\"This ultimately left the Premier League as a 33-weekend competition - fewer than previous seasons, despite being a 380-match competition since 1995. With fewer weekends to work with, the League is bound by how the calendar falls.",
      "\"The League can give an assurance that next season there will be more Premier League matches on Boxing Day - as the date falls on a Saturday.\"",
      "On December 27, Chelsea's home game with Aston Villa will be the Saturday Night Football fixture at 5.30pm. There is a Super Sunday double header on December 28 - Sunderland vs Leeds at 2pm and Crystal Palace vs Tottenham Hotspur at 4.30pm.",
      "Six games will be taking place on Tuesday December 30 - including Arsenal's home game with Aston Villa. Four games are on the evening of New Year's Day - Man Utd vs Wolves, Crystal Palace vs Fulham, Liverpool vs Leeds and Brentford vs Spurs, a fixture which marks Thomas Frank's return to the Bees.",

      "Saturday 1 November 2025 09:14, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and he isn't ready to trust Manchester United at short prices.",
      "A solid betting tactic to use is to give Brighton respect against the big boys and back them to be flaky against the rest.",
      "The Seagulls can turn Manchester City into mush one week, then turn into mush themselves the next against a team battling relegation. All three of Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester avoided defeat at the Amex last season and Brighton have already failed to beat Wolves this campaign when odds-on to do so.",
      "Against sides who sit in, frustrate and counter at speed, they often struggle to convert dominance into results. And Leeds possess the fourth best defensive process in the Premier League this season (9.23 expected goals against). They can make this another fiddly afternoon for the hosts with 10/11 with Sky Bet on Leeds double chance standing out.",
      "Some bets just make sense. Sometimes the obvious ones are the ones laced with the most value.",
      "You look at the numbers, you look at the patterns, you look at the opposition and you can almost hear the value whispering in your ear, saying \"back Arsenal to win to nil.\"",
      "Yes, the 10/11 with Sky Bet isn't going to change lives but it's a rock-solid play that over time will keep you ahead of the ledger in this battle against the oddsmakers. Arsenal's defensive record isn't just good, it's title-winning, elite, brick-wall good. They've now conceded just three goals in their last 14 matches across all competitions, winning 11 of those without conceding.",
      "If Arsenal win, they almost always do it whilst keeping their sheets clean. And Burnley, for all their endeavour, look ill-equipped to change that narrative.",
      "Yeremy Pino's start to life at Crystal Palace has been like a sparkler in a petrol station: lively, unpredictable and very dangerous. And that's exactly why Pino to either score or be carded at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a cracking bet this weekend. Pino has the desire be involved - one way or another - with or without the ball.",
      "Since arriving in south London, he's been averaging 2.5 shots per 90, getting into the central areas of the box regularly and showing exactly the kind of low-centre-of-gravity menace that is hard to mark - as seen by his classy goal at Anfield in midweek.",
      "But there's a flip side. For all that flair, there's a fiery edge. He leaves a leg in when the ball's gone and doesn't take kindly to being kicked himself. He's already been carded in three appearances which backs up his card-happy data from Spain where he was booked 12 times last season at a very healthy rate of 0.52 per 90.",
      "Fulham's new attacking livewire Kevin looks to have finally found his feet after being integrated into Marco Silva's system. And for those of us sniffing around the shots on target markets, he's shaping up as a player to follow over the next few weeks. Over his last few appearances, he's been popping up in dangerous areas, pulling defenders apart with his movement and, most importantly, shooting.",
      "He had seven shots in the midweek win on penalties against Wycombe, hitting the target three times. It's time for him now to be trusted in a Premier League game and the 2/1 with Sky Bet for him to have two or more shots on target is brimming with potential.",
      "Some teams make you feel safe when they're hovering around Evens away from home: Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, spring to mind.",
      "However, betting Manchester United at these prices is like going back to the ex who says: \"I've changed.\"",
      "You want to believe them, but deep down, you know exactly how this ends with hearts broken, fingers burnt and wallets bruised.",
      "This version of United under Ruben Amorim remain a deeply unreliable, defensively chaotic team. And that makes them punting poison at short prices like they are here at 21/20 with Sky Bet to win at Forest, meaning the home team on the double chance at 8/11 with Sky Bet is the confident play.",
      "Defensively, they're still hanging on by their fingernails. They've conceded 22 big chances in the Premier League this season, more than any other team. That's not bad luck, that's structural fragility, especially in the central midfield area.",
      "A low-scoring home win it is.",
      "You know a Premier League season has gone a bit rogue when Micky van de Ven, a centre-back who failed to score last season, is Tottenham's top scorer with five goals. But here we are. And for punters, that is where the value hides.",
      "Because at 14/1 with Sky Bet to score anytime against Chelsea, the Dutchman looks a cracking price in a season where defenders have suddenly become the headline acts.",
      "This Premier League season is producing record levels of goals from corners and free-kicks, something which still isn't being factored into the markets. Excluding penalties, 67 of the 241 goals scored this season have come via a set-piece (27.8 per cent). And 45 of those 241 goals scored have come via corners (18.7 per cent), a higher proportion than any other Premier League season.",
      "At 14/1 anytime, Van de Ven's implied probability is just 6.7 per cent. Given his form, Spurs' relentless set-piece output and Chelsea's defending, that number underplays the true probability.",
      "As Liverpool head into a pivotal stretch of their season, the smartest play might just be trusting Arne Slot to get it right again at a time where the narrative is portraying him as someone who is out of his depth.",
      "Because if the title-winning campaign taught us anything, it's that Slot knows how to manage chaos, rotate wisely and keep his squad peaking while others run out of steam.",
      "When Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy last season, it wasn't just about tactics and in-game substitutions, it was about player management. Slot got the blend between rotation and rhythm spot-on. He trusted his fringe players and made brave calls in the league that left his stars fresh for the big days. That's what this fixture is for Liverpool: a big one.",
      "And Slot knows it, hence why he's sacrificed the Carabao Cup in order to reboot his key players. It's the product of a manager who understands when to gamble and when to protect.",
      "Slot's already proven he can navigate the chaos better than anyone else. He can get Liverpool moving in the right direction again - starting here where the home win is generously priced at 4/6 with Sky Bet.",
      "West Ham remain unfit for purpose in this Premier League season as they've become a plodding, predictable outfit who are easily bullied.",
      "And this is a terrible match-up for them against perhaps the most aggressive and intense team on these shores.",
      "Joelinton, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon all will be licking their lips at winning their individual battles and I'm expecting Newcastle to be at it from the first whistle in order to turn the pressure up on the home players in front of their own fans, who have now seen nine games without a win at home, including five defeats in a row.",
      "Eddie Howe is a marginal gains type of manager and he'll know a fast start to get the home fans turned will be a key tactic to win this match.",
      "So, the way to boost the 8/13 with Sky Bet on a Newcastle win is just to concentrate on the first half. West Ham have scored just four first half goals in their last 20 matches and none in the last seven. Back the Toon to win the first half at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a punters pal when it comes to over goal lines away from home as 14 of their last 16 matches on the road have sailed over the 2.5 line. And since the start of last season their away games against last season's top five have averaged 3.9 goals per 90.",
      "However, with the Premier League only trending at 2.68 goals per 90 this season, which is almost 0.6 of a goal fewer than two seasons ago, I'm a little wary of backing over lines.",
      "The smarter play when your read on a game is for goals is to slide across into the goalscorer markets instead and chase a bigger price. Antoine Semenyo, who has scored eight goals in last 10 Premier League appearances, is the play at 7/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Looking at the data, Bournemouth's aim is to get him into dangerous positions in transition and City will leave spaces to be hit via that tactic. In what should be a goal heavy game, simply backing him to score at 7/2 is the smartest way to get a goals and pro Bournemouth play on side.",
      "Everyone's talking about Jack Grealish, yet, he's not even Everton's best player.",
      "If you actually use your eyes rather than just concentrate on the Grealish love-in, it's Iliman Ndiaye who's running the show in the final third. He's the one drifting between the lines, wriggling into pockets of space defenders hate and, crucially for us punters, is getting into shooting positions with real intent. Something that Grealish isn't doing.",
      "Ndiaye has already scored three goals this season - two more than Grealish. He's had seven shots on target - three more than Grealish and his expected goals return is higher by 1.5 expected goals than Grealish.",
      "He's also the penalty taker for Everton, meaning the anytime goalscorer price of 3/1 with Sky Bet being dangled is too juicy to pass up. You're effectively investing at 3/1 in Everton's most advanced and most involved attacking player who also could have a free shot from 12 yards if the ref points to the spot."

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Friday 31 October 2025 12:25, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map hints at a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morato inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",
      "The Old Trafford club have long been admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba - but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",
      "Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another on the radar Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",
      "While transfer business is not on the immediate agenda, Wilcox heaped praise on United's summer acquisitions, who he says are guiding the club in the right direction on the pitch.",
      "\"They are all good guys,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "\"I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "\"I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "\"Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.\"",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Thursday 30 October 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."
