      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood was involved in an on-pitch brawl during Marseille's pre-season win over Aston Villa. The Ligue 1 side defeated Unai Emery's Villans 3-1 during their warm-up meeting on Saturday, though the fixture was anything but friendly.",
      "Greenwood put his side ahead just five minutes in before John McGinn equalised. Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then scored twice to secure a win for the French side, while Emery's men fell to a fifth pre-season defeat.",
      "Frustrations boiled over after Greenwood, having bounced off several feisty challenges in succession, cynically tripped Amadou Onana from behind after the Villa midfielder made a pass. Onana appeared to take exception to the challenge, and the pair began to square up to each other.",
      "Greenwood was seen laughing in the Belgian's face and seemingly blew a raspberry at Onana. That's when his Villa team-mate Tyrone Mings intervened, with the situation escalating as the defender grabbed Greenwood's jersey and dragged him back and forth.",
      "Players from both teams intervened and pulled the pair apart, with Greenwood's shirt being left ripped. However, despite their violent conduct, neither player was shown a red card.",
      "Greenwood, 23, took to Instagram after the match to share snapshots from the win but made no mention of the on-pitch altercation.",
      "One image showed him celebrating with his team-mates. He also reposted a clip of himself shrugging off Mings' challenge before tucking away the opening goal.",
      "Greenwood parted ways with the Red Devils last summer following a suspension by the club in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. All charges were subsequently dropped, and the winger joined Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023.",
      "His permanent transfer to Marseille in 2024 included a substantial sell-on clause in the deal, should Marseille decide to offload him in the future.",
      "Greenwood scored 21 Ligue 1 goals last season, and there were reports that he could be set for a move back to the Premier League. However, a transfer did not materialise, and Greenwood looks set to represent Marseille in the Champions League this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is prepared to admit defeat on his career at Manchester United and pursue the exit door after the signing of Benjamin Sesko pushed him further down the pecking order.",
      "Ruben Amorim has signed a number of new forwards, but it wasn't until Saturday that they confirmed the capture of a No 9. They spent more than £70million to land Sesko and that is set to hamper Hojlund's involvement going forward.",
      "He has previously rejected the potential of a move to RB Leipzig when the Manchester outfit were negotiating over a deal for Sesko. Now though the Dane is being more receptive to the idea of leaving Old Trafford with AC Milan coming to the table, reports TalkSport.",
      "The Italians are in talks with United over a potential move for the £40m-rated Hojlund. The Serie A outfit would ideally want a loan deal with a buy option at the end of the season as the Red Devils look to recoup some of the cash they paid to sign the striker only two years ago.",
      "If he does leave for the aforementioned fee it would still represent a loss of around £30m on the striker, who managed just four goals in the Premier League last term. That lack of potency is what motivated Amorim to go into the market.",
      "Only last week had Hojlund claimed, amid the talk of United pursuing a new striker, that he relished the prospect of competition and was determined to prove himself. “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Joshua Zirkzee has a future in Manchester with Sesko now due to spearhead an attack that will also feature Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. All in all the Portuguese manager has spent more than £200m in his first summer.",
      "Amorim himself failed to rule out the possibility of Hojlund leaving in this window as he admitted: “The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.\"",

      "Manchester United have sent a subtle message to Newcastle after beating them to the signing of Benjamin Sesko. United announced the signing of Sesko from RB Leipzig for a fee of £66.4m plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons on Saturday.",
      "He was unveiled at Old Trafford ahead of their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina after signing a five-year contract. The 22-year-old is the third major addition to Ruben Amorim’s forward line after the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko was previously linked with Arsenal before it became a straight shoot-out between United and Newcastle. The Slovenia international made it clear that he preferred Old Trafford to St James’ Park, despite United’s lack of European football this season, and the move was wrapped up swiftly.",
      "His decision came as yet another blow to Newcastle, who have been continually thwarted in the transfer market this summer. While they have signed Anthony Elanga for £55m from Nottingham Forest, they have missed out on Sesko and Mbeumo to United, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Liam Delap and Joao Pedro to Chelsea, among others.",
      "United appeared keen to rub their noses in it on Saturday with a provocative post on X. “It was only ever United,” they wrote alongside two pictures of Sesko with director of football Jason Wilcox. The comments below were filled with memes poking fun at Newcastle, who could still lose Alexander Isak to Liverpool to round off a miserable summer.",
      "The Magpies will play in the Champions League this season after finishing fifth, yet still couldn’t persuade Sesko to join. He will lead the line for a side that finished 15th last season, yet made it clear why he made that call.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Amorim told MUTV: “He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working – it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "“He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good at running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.”",

      "Roy Keane reacted in hilariously typical fashion when a fan tried to hug him before last year's Community Shield clash. Keane and Ian Wright appeared as pundits on ITV for the 2024 fixture between Manchester United and Manchester City.",
      "Keane's former team United went a goal up in the 82nd minute thanks to Alejandro Garnacho, but conceded just seven minutes later to Bernardo Silva, before going on to lose the first Manchester Derby of the season on penalties.",
      "Prior to the match at Wembley Stadium, Wright and Keane were pitchside preparing for their television roles when YouTube personality Harry Pinero and fellow content creator CultureCams appeared and approached the football legends.",
      "They greeted Ian Wright warmly, hugging the Arsenal legend and laughing as they enjoyed a nice chat. They then met Keane, who shook Pinero's hand initially, and then CultureCam's, in a relatively friendly manner.",
      "But the latter, immediately after introducing himself, attempted to show the Irishman the same affection he had shown Wright. Yet, that was a step too far for the intimidating and notoriously no-nonsense former midfielder.",
      "The ex-Red Devils captain was clearly caught off guard by the personal nature of the greeting. Keane didn't seem too impressed as CultureCams embraced him and awkwardly stood still without putting his own arm around the YouTuber, all while sporting a puzzled facial expression.",
      "His reaction left Wright and Pinero in heaps of laughter as the former England striker said: \"We all love him bro, but you can't come in like that.\" Keane, still stunned at the audacity, then gave a slight smile as the YouTuber corrected his error by offering him a simple handshake.",
      "Later, CultureCams didn't appear to regret his brazen move and seemed well aware that the Irishman was not a fan of hugs, writing on X: \"I did it for all of us.\"",
      "The clash marks Palace’s first appearance in the annual fixture, which has been a staple of the football calendar for nearly 120 years. Arne Slot's side, meanwhile, have lifted the shield 16 times. Both teams will look to begin their respective seasons on the right track ahead of next weekend’s Premier League 2025/26 season openers.",
      "Liverpool have bolstered their squad by spending around £265million on new signings in the summer transfer window, which could shoot up to £400m if they manage to secure Alexander Isak. Meanwhile, Palace have been disappointing in the transfer window while they await their European fate after appealing their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League.",

      "Manchester United's new signings prove that joining the club remains a dream move due to the Red Devils' legacy. Ruben Amorim's side have brought in three highly-rated forwards this summer, despite the prospect of a year without European football.",
      "United may have been concerned about their remaining pulling power in the transfer market after finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final last season. It was not the ideal sales pitch to convince top players to join Amorim's squad, combined with the financial implications of missing out on a Champions League spot to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, in their latest transfer coup, the Red Devils beat Newcastle United to the signing of striker Benjamin Sesko. Fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who was also wanted by the Magpies, have already explained why the trio had their hearts set on heading to Old Trafford.",
      "Upon becoming United’s first summer signing, Cunha said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.",
      "Echoing Cunha’s message, Mbeumo explained that he was a boyhood United fan, demonstrating the club’s lasting appeal: “As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.”",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson may have retired more than a decade ago but the club’s glory days live long in the memory, even for 22-year-old Sesko. \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,” the striker said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.”",
      "United’s ability to secure deals for their top targets is in stark contrast to what Newcastle have endured this summer. Several forwards, including Mbeumo and Sesko, have chosen other clubs over Eddie Howe’s side, despite the club winning a trophy and qualifying for the Champions League last term. Their struggles to sign a striker have also added another layer to Alexander Isak’s transfer saga.",
      "Meanwhile, United boss Amorim will be happy to have assembled his new-look forward line. The Red Devils were in urgent need of a centre-forward, following Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee’s struggles up front, and Amorim believes Sesko is the right man to lead the line.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"Ben is a player - with all the information that we have - that we need to stop the guy from working, not the opposite!",
      "\"So that is also important. He's really young. He's good in the air, he's good at running the channels, good on the ball. I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot and, for sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He has the right character to be in this group, so I'm really happy to have him.\"",
      "However, United have not finished their summer rebuild. Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is valued at around £100m, has emerged as the club’s next target as United look to fix another area of the team.",
      "The Red Devils welcomed club icon David De Gea back to Old Trafford during their final pre-season fixture on Saturday. United drew 1-1 with Fiorentina as Amorim continued his team’s preparations ahead of their season opener against Arsenal next Sunday.",

      "The 28-year-old is now a free agent after his deal with the Toffees came to an end and is seeking his next opportunity, which he hopes could come at Old Trafford. Whilst Calvert-Lewin struggled for goals last term he has been prolific in the past with injuries disrupting his career.",
      "Many believed that his previous exploits would see a raft of offers come in, especially given he's been linked with United and Newcastle in the past, but nothing has been forthcoming.",
      "The England international, who won 11 caps for his country, is ready to take his destiny into his own hands, reports The Sun, with his next move yet to be decided.",
      "Calvert-Lewin was once linked with a £50million switch to Manchester, but that never materialised. Ruben Amorim has just spent big on Benjamin Sesko, signing the striker from RB Leipzig, and it remains to be seen if there's any appetite to bring in more firepower.",
      "It has been reported that Aston Villa would be keen on the ex-Everton man whilst Premier League new boys Sunderland are also interested in him. Calvert-Lewin came through the ranks at Sheffield United but it has been sometime since he consistently hit his best level.",
      "From 2019 to 2021 the striker scored 36 times - including his single-season best haul of 21 when Carlo Ancelotti was in charge. One of those goals included a 95th minute equaliser for Everton during a 3-3 draw against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The striker was once the deputy to Harry Kane with England and was pushing for more involvement, but his career has dipped. However he has made it clear previously that he has lofty ambitions which he believes are still attainable.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Ollie Watkins already share a strong rapport - one that might have deepened at Manchester United had things gone differently this summer. Earlier in the window, United weighed up a move for Watkins before turning instead to Benjamin Sesko, whose £74million switch to Old Trafford was sealed on Saturday.",
      "Supporters are understandably excited to see the Slovenian in action, but his lack of Premier League experience invites caution, with memories of Rasmus Hojlund's steep learning curve still fresh. Watkins may not have been the flashier option for the Red Devils, yet Mainoo's admiration for the England forward suggests he might have welcomed that alternative outcome.",
      "Despite being nearly a decade apart in age, Mainoo and Watkins forged a clear camaraderie during Euro 2024. After Watkins' dramatic last-gasp winner in England's semi-final victory over the Netherlands, Mainoo needed just one word to sum him up on Instagram.",
      "\"Clutch,\" the United midfielder wrote in reply to Watkins' celebratory post. The feeling was mutual.",
      "Earlier in the tournament, Watkins had been asked for his thoughts on Mainoo and didn't hold back. \"He doesn't act his age,\" the Aston Villa striker told ITV. \"He's very mature on and off the pitch. Again, unbelievable English talent.",
      "\"[He's] got the world at his feet. I can't speak more highly of him. He's athletic and the composure on the ball - to take the ball and receive it in tight areas as a midfielder.",
      "\"I think that sets you apart, especially for the way we want to play. He is so comfortable on the ball. You can see why he's so comfortable on the ball.\"",
      "Such mutual admiration suggests the pair would have had little trouble linking up at club level had Watkins joined United this summer. But any notion of such a partnership will need to be parked for now.",
      "With Sesko's arrival ending United's immediate pursuit of a striker, a move for Watkins is off the table - though it's understood the 29-year-old remains admired at Old Trafford and could yet be targeted in the future.",
      "That said, United will hope it never comes to that. More than £200m has just been poured into a brand new front three, with Sesko joining Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a sweeping summer rebuild designed to end any need for attacking reinforcements in the near future.",
      "Mbeumo struck 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, while Cunha hit 15 for Wolves. Sesko, meanwhile, netted 13 times in the Bundesliga for RB Leipzig - three fewer than Watkins managed in the league for Aston Villa.",
      "Still, there is no shortage of optimism at Old Trafford, and beyond, that Sesko could develop into a generation-defining talent. The 22-year-old, once heavily linked with Arsenal, has been compared to both Erling Haaland and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, blending physical attributes with technical ones, with his towering frame, blistering pace, eye-catching ball control and ruthless finishing turning heads across Europe.",
      "For now, it will be Sesko, not Watkins, making runs off Mainoo's passes at Old Trafford. The pair will have to build their own understanding, but given Mainoo's composure in midfield and Sesko's movement in behind, the foundations are there.",
      "Still, the warmth between Mainoo and Watkins at Euro 2024 lingers as a reminder of the partnership that might have been - and one United may yet revisit if circumstances change.",

      "Manchester United were all set to sign French defender Benjamin Pavard two years ago until Harry Maguire's move to West Ham stalled. England centre-back Maguire has navigated dramatic highs and some extreme lows since signing for the Red Devils in a huge £80million deal from Leicester City in July 2019.",
      "After a series of on-pitch errors, leading to United legend Roy Keane calling him out on numerous occasions, Maguire's time at Old Trafford looked to finally be coming to an end in the summer of 2023. With former manager Erik ten Hag then at the helm, the now-32-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements after he was unceremoniously stripped of the club captaincy.",
      "His failed move to east London had a severe knock-on effect for United. The Red Devils were in need of the £30m in order to secure Pavard, who was in the last year of his deal at Bayern Munich and a deal was \"ready to go\" for, per Sky. He has since made a switch to Inter Milan.",
      "United had already spent close to £200m that summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund. They were said to be without much wiggle room when it came to Financial Fair Play to pull off a deal for Pavard, now 29, without banking the money for Maguire first.",
      "The arrival of Ruben Amorim in November 2024 perhaps seemed like the beginning of the end for Maguire, once again, at United. However, the Sheffield-born star fought his way back into the team and demonstrated that he can still mix with it the best, despite United ultimately finishing in 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "Such is Amorim's faith in the defender that reports suggest he is ready to keep Maguire at the club despite widespread interest. Matters are complicated by the fact that the former Leicester star is out of contract next summer and free to talk to overseas clubs in January.",

      "Manchester United's rebuild continues under Ruben Amorim with the club confirming the signing of Benjamin Sesko this weekend - capturing the striker from under Newcastle's nose.",
      "The Red Devils beat their Premier League rivals to the signing of the Slovenian, who moves to Old Trafford for more than £70million to bolster their attack. The club had been looking to land a new frontman to compliment fellow newbies Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It is understood that a midfielder is next on their shopping list with Brighton's Carlos Baleba heavily linked, albeit the player himself has shown no desire to quit Brighton. The Seagulls also do not have to sell this summer.",
      "Amorim will also hope to rid of some of his fringe players, some of their big names on big wages. The likes of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnaco and Antony are well yet to find new homes. Here's the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "United's new frontman admitted the mood around the club was evident from minute one with Amorim's changes clearly making a difference when attracting new faces. The ex-Sporting Lisbon manager's vision is also turning heads and aided Sesko's decision.",
      "He said: “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "PSG anticipate a number of bids for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma after already signing his replacement — and the French champions believe United will be among the clubs queuing up.",
      "The Parisians have agreed a deal for Lille shotstopper Lucas Chevalier, who will join on a five-year contract after the Champions League winners decided to pay up €40m (£34.7m), with the potential for a further €15m (£13m) in add-ons, for his services.",
      "Donnarumma has just one year remaining on his contract in Paris and the club are happy to part ways with the understanding they would still have two top goalkeepers at the Parc des Princes. The former AC Milan star is said to have been interested in extending his deal but an agreement was not reached.",
      "United could face firm competition from local neighbours Manchester City, who are also keeping tabs on Baleba. Reports claim that the Red Devils have made contact with Brighton through intermediaries to register their interest in Baleba, who was signed for £23.2m back in 2023.",
      "But United are not the only club who see the Cameroon international as a shrewd addition with City also long-time fans. ESPN have confirmed Pep Guardiola's interest in the Brighton man but it is unclear whether would look to match any United bid this summer.",

      "Mason Greenwood and Tyrone Mings angrily clashed in their pre-season meeting, with the ex-Manchester United man being grabbed by the neck. Greenwood’s current side Marseille took on Aston Villa in a friendly on Saturday evening.",
      "But it ended up being an ill-tempered affair between the two sides. New signing Evann Guessand, Matty Cash, John McGinn, and Donyell Malen were all booked throughout the clash.",
      "Tensions then boiled over late on between Greenwood and a couple of Villa stars. The striker kicked out at Belgian midfielder Andre Onana after evading a number of challenges.",
      "That did not go down well with the former Everton man, who berated Greenwood, who then laughed in his face. Onana then pointed to his face as though the forward has spat at him, but it was unclear on whether he had actually done so.",
      "Defender Mings then got involved as he grappled with Greenwood and grabbed the striker by the scruff of his neck. Numerous players then piled in as the scenes turned ugly.",
      "Tempers soon calmed but Greenwood was left with a ripped shirt and was shortly taken off of the pitch by Roberto De Zerbi - who was spotted arguing with Unai Emery on the sidelines.",
      "Villa eventually fell to a 3-1 defeat to Marseille. Greenwood had scored in the first half, while Villa captain John McGinn also found the net.",
      "But two strikes from returning forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang secured victory for the French side. Villa round off their preparations for the new campaign on Sunday as they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal.",

      "Greenwood will be hoping to extend the hot form that he displayed last season. The former United forward struck 22 goals in all competitions last term.",
      "He has been at the heart of considerable transfer interest this summer. Barcelona have regularly been linked with him, while he also reportedly has admirers in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Greenwood has also made a major change when it comes to his international allegiances. Having previously earned one England cap, he is now set to represent Jamaica having been granted citizenship.",

      "The veteran goalkeeper, 34, spent 12 years at Old Trafford and was in talks to extend his stay further before Erik ten Hag, the club's former manager, decided he wanted to sign a new keeper. De Gea was subsequently released with the club declining to take up a one year option in the Spaniard's contract.",
      "The decision to part ways with De Gea - plus the way it was handled - massively divided opinion at the time.",
      "But De Gea, who played at Old Trafford in a pre-season friendly for his new club, Fiorentina, on Saturday, said there is no bad blood with United when he was asked if he was disappointed over the circumstances of his exit.",
      "\"No. Sometimes football is like it is, you can't control everything,\" he replied.",
      "\"I've been here [Manchester United] 12 years, very, very nice, it's one of the best periods of my life. Playing for this club is just unbelievable, especially when you leave the club, you realise how big is the club, how difficult it was to be 12 years in a club like United. I'm always grateful for this club, for everyone, it's been an amazing journey.",
      "\"It's been a long time since I've been back here so it's been a special day, of course.\"",
      "After making the decision to move in a different direction in the goalkeeping department, Manchester United signed Andre Onana from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47.2million.",

That in turn has led to speculation that United could move to sign a new goalkeeper this summer and several names have been linked with the Red Devils, who finished 15th last season.",

      "Nevertheless, United's new-look frontline, short of Benjamin Sesko who was presented to fans ahead of the game, showed glimpses of promise. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but will have lofty expectations having come in with a proven Premier League record.",
      "It was Mount that drew praise from Amorim on Saturday afternoon for his role in the frontline however. The ex-Chelsea star proved his versatility and persistence and could be set to start the season, with Sesko only having a week to get up to speed in time for Arsenal.",

United were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, underlining that they still have a long way to go under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United found themselves 1-0 down after just eight minutes as Simon Sohm was left completely unmarked from a corner to put Fiorentina ahead. The hosts levelled shortly after with an own goal from Robin Gosens from a set piece of their own but couldn’t find a winner.",
      "Amorim fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in central midfield, with Mason Mount playing as a false No.9 up front with new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Benjamin Sesko was introduced to the crowd before kick-off after completing his £74million move from RB Leipzig and fans called out for another transfer during the game.",
      "Casemiro is now 33 years old and has been with United for three years following a move from Real Madrid. He has been linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia, but that hasn’t materialised and some fans are frustrated by his performances.",
      "“Casemiro does everything in slow mo,” one wrote on X. “Casemiro’s knees have gone for real, he’s a masters player now,” another added. A third wrote: “Casemiro is finished. So slow. Desperately need a midfielder.”",
      "It is clear who the fans have in mind: Carlos Baleba. The Brighton star has been linked with a move to United, but the Seagulls value him at over £100m, making a deal very difficult to do. Nevertheless, Casemiro’s performance against Fiorentina has some convinced that Baleba is worth it.",
      "“Casemiro's legs are gone. Ugarte is error prone. United desperately need a DM,” one fan wrote. “He's only playing Casemiro and Fernandes in midfield so he can demand Baleba is in by Wednesday,” another added. A third joked: “Wise of Amorim to pick Casemiro in midfield to highlight why we need Baleba.”",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo both made appearances off the bench against Fiorentina in the second half, while Toby Collyer was another midfield option in the squad. Meanwhile, it was telling that Rasmus Hojlund was left on the bench, despite no other centre-forward being available.",
      "Hojlund’s place is clearly under threat following the arrival of Sesko, who scored 21 times for Leipzig last season. The Dane struggled last season, netting just 10 times in all competitions, with just four in the league, and could be sold to raise funds for further deals.",
      "United have already splashed over £200m to bring in Sesko, Cunha, Mbeumo and left-back Diego Leon, but still want further additions. A new goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana and Altar Bayindir is on the cards, as well as a No.6 midfielder. The club has until the end of September to reinforce their squad, which finished 15th last season.",

      "The early stages of the match did not show a team ready to take on Arsenal next week. Some scandalous defending from an eighth minute corner left two bodies completely free and saw Simon Sohm to hit the ball first time past Altay Bayindir.",
      "And while United settled in to dominate position, they're equaliser required a corner of their own and some good fortune. Robin Gosens put the ball into his own net with Casemiro lucky not to be punished after putting some enthusiastic pressure on his opponent.",
      "Flashes of creativity emerged from the home team's frontline of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha but clear-cut opportunities were not always forthcoming against former United goalkeeper David De Gea. Smart play between Mount and Bruno fernandes offered United their best opportunity for Cunha, but the Brazil international saw an effort from eight yards blocked in the closing stages of the game.",
      "After United confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko on Saturday morning, it was no surprise to see the 22-year-old in attendance at Old Trafford. The striker was presented to fans alongside Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo before kick-off.",
      "It was Sesko who received the loudest cheer as he entered the Theatre of Dreams and soon may have the greatest expectations of finding the net. While Cunha and Mbeumo started against Fiorentina, Sesko is likely the final piece of a new frontline.",
      "\"He's really young. He's good in the air. He's good running the channels. He's good on the ball. So I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot,\" said Amorim before kick-off.",
      "\"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.\"",
      "Amorim will hope his new front three can soon find the net after not looking too likely to against Italian opposition. The interplay and playmaking from Cunha and Mbeumo gives some reason for optimism however.",
      "Mason Mount's outing suggests he should not be ruled out of the club's starting XI either. The former Chelsea man has plenty of talent to take advantage of and could yet keep his place against Arsenal as Sesko settles in.",
      "The goalkeeper made his return to Manchester having departed in 2023. It was no surprise to see a positive reception as soon as he entered the field to warm up and having greeted United stars in the tunnel, De Gea was also presented with a framed picture ahead of kick-off.",
      "The applause did not stop there as his first pause in possession of the ball saw a lively reception. And the Spaniard showed some of his trademark talent too.",
      "After 30 minutes De Gea rolled back the years to save Leny Yoro's point blank range header to send a reminder to all those in attendance. Few were better as a shotstopper than De Gea during his time at United and he earned an impressive response when replaced in the 87th minute.",
      "The veteran is a rare legend to emerge from a relative fallow period having guarded the net for United's last Premier League title more than a decade ago. It was perhaps time to move on but his quality can certainly be appreciated.",
      "Ahead of the game, Ruben Amorim spoke of the importance in managing the team's minutes to ensure his team are ready for the start of the season. One figure who has been a consistent presence is defender Lenny Yoro however.",
      "Despite his tender age, the French central defender has started four of the five friendlies. Yoro's team-mates in the backline have seen greater rotation with Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven's requiring time on the pitch to get up to speed.",
      "After injury prevented him making a quick impression 12 months ago, Yoro looks a certain starter next week.",
      "With frontline additions now complete, United's attention could turn to midfield. Players may need to be sold to facilitate a significant move but Amorim will have received a reminder that he still requires more depth.",
      "It wasn't too long before Casemiro established that a midfield combination with Bruno Fernandes is not the ideal make-up for the Portuguese coach. The Brazilian looked a little slow for the intensity awaiting in the Premier League and when he lost the ball on the edge of the box it was clear United fans were not convinced.",
      "Perhaps Rasmus Hojlund could be a player to help free up some cash. The Dane wanted to remain at Old Trafford but a potential move to AC Milan could be gathering pace.",
      "A loan with an option to sign Hojlund looks to be on the table, though the foorward is said to be reluctant to make a temporary move. Playing time was not high on the agend for the attacker however and he did not make it on to the pitch having being named among the substitutes.",
      "Manchester United's transfer business and pre-season performances have perhaps offered some enthusiasm for the new Premier League campaign. Amorim has already suggested he can see a difference in his side.",
      "“I can feel the improvements in the environment now that the right details are in place to help us all to be better,\" he wrote in his programme notes. \"The players we worked with last season are looking stronger, and we have made some important additions to the squad.\"",
      "Leaving two players free from a corner to go behind at home was not a sign that all the details were complete however. There were flashes of creativity and talent in United's forward play but to suggest it was always convincing would be a stretch.",

      "Manchester United are unwilling to include midfield prospect Toby Collyer as part of a move for Carlos Baleba. Brighton star Baleba is valued at £100million as Ruben Amorim looks to address another key area of his side.",
      "United have completed a £74m deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old is the third forward the club have signed this summer, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo helping to revamp the team’s frontline.",
      "Following the trio’s arrival, Baleba has emerged as a target for United and there had been speculation that midfielder Collyer could be used to help the club reach Brighton’s valuation. However, United are keen to keep Collyer on their books, which will please club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The 21-year-old impressed Fernandes during his European debut against Rangers in January. Collyer was picked to start ahead of Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro, and the United skipper highlighted his performance.",
      "\"He trains very well every week, trains at the maximum level,\" Fernandes told MUTV. \"He's a really good kid who wants to learn. “He's eager to learn and listen and he has big, big qualities. He's aggressive off the ball, he's aggressive running with the ball, he's class in tight spaces, and he is just going to get better.\"",
      "Fernandes was not the only club icon to praise Collyer’s contributions in a United shirt. Rio Ferdinand was on commentary during United’s 2-1 win over Rangers and appreciated the midfielder’s work.",
      "Ferdinand had previously spoken positively about Collyer’s efforts in the club’s FA Cup victory over Arsenal. “Toby Collyer was excellent when he came on, the energy levels were huge, through the roof. Testament to him,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube Channel.",
      "A few days later, Collyer once again impressed Ferdinand from the bench in a win over Southampton. “I really like him, I think he's got great energy, he's done that a few times off the bench,” the pundit said on Rio Ferdinand Presents. “Gives us that extra pair of legs to get amongst it. looks confident, wants to take the ball.\"",
      "Collyer, who joined United from Brighton’s academy in 2022, was determined to impress Amorim during the club’s tour of the USA. However, the 21-year-old admitted he may have to head out on loan in search of more game time.",
      "“I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" Collyer told reporters. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan. The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.”",
      "He added: \"Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",

      "United have signed Sesko from RB Leipzig for a fee of £66.4m plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. The 22-year-old striker has signed a five-year contract with United and will line up alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this season.",
      "Sesko chose United over Newcastle, who also had a bid accepted by Leipzig, and could make his debut when Amorim’s side begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal next weekend. He was unveiled at Old Trafford before United’s final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday, with Amorim explaining what attracted him to the Slovenia international.",
      "“He has the characteristics that we needed,” Amorim told MUTV. “Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working – it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "“He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good at running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot.",
      "“For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.”",
      "United recently returned from their pre-season tour of the United States and have a new £236m training complex to enjoy at Carrington. After a miserable 2024/25 campaign, in which they finished 15th in the league and lost the Europa League final, Amorim believes Sesko is walking into a better environment.",
      "He added: \"That is important, and he is going to notice on the first day, in the first training [session] that he is in the right place. He is going to the new building and that is also important. Things are getting better, but in the end, we need to win games, and we will try to start today.”",
      "Sesko could have played in the Champions League if he’d joined Newcastle, but snubbed them for United. “The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",

      "Manchester United are pushing to secure a sensational £100million deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. With his new-look £200m front three now in place, manager Ruben Amorim now wants a steely midfielder to shore things up in the centre of the park and protect the back line - and Baleba is top of the club's shortlist.",
      "The Cameroon international has been quietly, but consistently, turning heads since stepping into Moises Caicedo's sizable shoes following the Ecuadorian's mega-money move to Chelsea in 2023. As a result, Brighton have no intention of selling him amid reports it will take a nine-figure sum to simply bring them to the negotiating table.",
      "United know prising Baleba from Brighton will be no easy task, but have nonetheless opened talks with the Seagulls to test their resolve. Meeting the asking price would make the 21-year-old the most expensive signing in the club's history - and mark one of the costliest deals the sport has ever seen.",
      "But it won't be all sunshine and rainbows after that. In fact, Baleba will have to be on his best behaviour, with four strict rules - implemented by Amorim - to adhere to. The Portuguese boss has introduced these measures to raise standards at Old Trafford after a disappointing first season at the helm - one plagued by poor form and ill-discipline. Here's what the young midfielder would face:",
      "Players are prohibited from treating international breaks as vacation time. This rule came after incidents like Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetting off to the US for leisure when not selected for national duty.",
      "Amorim emphasised setting club standards for rest, such as limiting travel or days off. \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that,\" he said of the changes.",
      "\"It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "To prioritise physical fitness, Amorim has outlawed food in the dressing room on matchdays. This is part of his broader push to maintain elite conditioning and uphold higher professional standards within the squad.",
      "News of the ban came after Amorim spoke of the importance of his team being in peak physical condition to \"run like mad dogs\" and compete with the very best in the Premier League.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win,\" he said in December last year. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win.\"",
      "In a bid to foster accountability and competition, the losing side in training sessions is now required to collect all the equipment used that day. This rule is designed to instil discipline and motivation ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Speaking about the new rule, United youngster Toby Collyer told The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Diogo Dalot noted that pre-season standards have risen compared to last year, hinting earlier this month that the new rule may be achieving its intended impact. \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear,\" the Portugal defender said.",
      "One of Amorim's first major changes was banning coaches from delivering overly complicated instructions, insisting everything be simplified before reaching the players. The aim: to streamline communication and sharpen focus.",
      "Despite wanting to instil the same fluid, intricate, high-octane style his Sporting CP side mastered, the 40-year-old is taking a more refined approach to conveying messages. This is designed to ensure players act instinctively on the pitch, without being bogged down by overthinking.",
      "Amorim believes clarity breeds confidence - and that player who understands their roles implicitly will execute them with far greater precision under pressure.",

      "Cunha was the first to be snapped up, though, signing from Wolves at the beginning of June after his £62.5m release clause was activated. However, Cole, who starred in the Premier League for West Ham, Chelsea and Liverpool, believes the 26-year-old's attitude is a major worry.",
      "\"I wouldn't want to say he is a bad lad because I wouldn't want to say that, but he's a bit of a maverick and I've heard people talk about him being a bit of a maverick.",
      "\"The last thing that United dressing room needs is another maverick, there are mavericks everywhere putting stuff on social media and all that. You hear too much coming out of that dressing room so it's a gamble with Cunha.\"",
      "Cunha landed himself in hot water last season, twice being fined and banned by the Football Association for misconduct. The first incident came in December, when he was handed a two-game ban and hit with an £80,000 fine for an altercation against Ipswich Town in the Premier League.",
      "After the full-time whistle, a scuffle broke out between Wolves and the victorious Ipswich players, and Cunha appeared to strike a member of the opposition's coaching team. His suspension was confirmed in January.",
      "Later in March, Cunha was fined another £50k and suspended for an extra fourth game of a three-match ban after he was sent off for clashing with defender Milos Kerkez, now of Liverpool, in extra time of Wolves' FA Cup defeat by Bournemouth.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain anticipate a possible flurry of bids for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma after already signing his replacement — and the French champions believe Manchester United will be among the clubs queuing up. PSG have agreed a deal for Lille shotstopper Lucas Chevalier, who will join on a five-year contract after the Champions League winners decided to pay up €40million (£34.7m), with the potential for a further €15m (£13) in add-ons, for his services.",
      "Donnarumma has just one year remaining on his contract in Paris and the club are happy to part ways with the understanding they would still have two top goalkeepers at the Parc des Princes. The former AC Milan star is said to have been interested in extending his deal but an agreement was not reached.",
      "Donnarumma had wanted an increase in pay despite being among the team's highest earners. The Italian international is currently on €850,000-a-month (£736,000) and failed to come into line with the club's new salary structure focused on lower salary bases with greater incentives",
      "PSG expect to receive an offer from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, according to ESPN. The trio of European giants are reported to have been in touch with Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "United have been widely linked to signing a goalkeeper in recent months, though not always of the same calibre as Donnarumma. The future of back-up option Altay Bayindir has been uncertain with greater competition for Andre Onana said to be wanted.",
      "Onana's injury in pre-season also added fuel to speculation in combination with his unconvincing United career. The ex-Ajax ace is expected to be fit in time for the start of the Premier League season however.",
      "United have already spent in excess of £200million this summer. The Red Devils ambitions have been on replenishing their forward line thus far in the transfer window.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko was confirmed by the club on a five-year deal after agreeing a fee worth up to £74m with Bundesliga side RB Leipzig. The Slovenia striker joins Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in Ruben Amorim's squad.",

      "Last season, season ticket holders behind the dugouts in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand were informed their seats would be converted into premium hospitality seats, which meant they would be relocated.",
      "Around 500 supporters were affected and the club received intense backlash. Some of the fans who were forced to move have platinum season tickets (25+ years) and felt their loyalty meant nothing.",
      "The decision triggered protests from the affected fans, who aimed banners at the directors' box.",
      "Despite the controversy, the changes to convert the area into premium seating were made this summer and they were seen for the first time before the Fiorentina friendly on Saturday.",
      "The seats are near the pitch and offer easy access in and out of the stadium. They also offer a close view of Ruben Amorim on the touchline and the players on the bench are almost within touching distance.",
      "Defending their decision, United previously explained it was made to 'reflect the high value of this unique location.' They also claimed that they: \"Appreciate the disruption this will cause those fans who currently sit there and we will be contacting them individually to ensure a suitable alternative seat is found.\"",
      "In March, one season ticket holder of 40 years, who had tickets with his family and didn't wish to be named while in the process of being moved, said: \"The people who are in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand are the people who've been season ticket holders and supporting the club the longest.",
      "\"There's been several clips on social media about people talking about having had those season tickets for over 50 years. I’ve had mine for 40. So you're attacking the people who've supported the club through some very thin times over the years, and they're the people who will continue to bring in the next generation of support.",

We've had contact with a number of people who are thinking if that's the way it is, I think the love affair’s over, unfortunately.\"",

      "Concerns were initially raised last month when a photo showing concourse prices from Soccer Aid circulated on social media. United said prices were still undecided, but they have now confirmed a hike for beer.",
      "Fans who attended the Fiorentina friendly on Saturday were stung by increased costs, with the price of bottle of Carling (500ml) increasing by 30 per cent and a pint of Madri increasing by 51 per cent.",
      "Supporters have already complained about the price increases, and more fans will be affected when Old Trafford is at full capacity for the opening Premier League game of the season.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this has coincided with high increases in food & beverage (25-30%) in the last three years since kiosk prices were last reviewed holistically.",
      "\"To reflect the increase in operating costs, and the rising cost of produce, for the 2025/26 campaign we will not be able to continue offering this discount and therefore some kiosk prices will increase.",
      "\"Most notably, bottled Carling (500ml) will increase from £3.80 to £4.95 (which remains cheaper than 3 years ago), and a pint of Madri will increase from £3.80 to £5.75.",
      "\"Although this is an increase on previous seasons, it still means a pint of beer is beneath the £6 average in the Premier League, and well beneath the average cost of a pint of beer at five local pubs to Old Trafford used by fans on match day (£6.29).",
      "\"Based on prices known publicly, the revised pricing means Old Trafford will serve the 9th cheapest pint in the Premier League.",
      "\"Meal deals remain available, and fans can pick up three items for £10.70 (£1 increase on 2024/25) and six items for £20 (£2.80 increase on 2024/25) offering good value for money (meal deals include 1 hot food item, typically grill-type e.g. pie or hot dog, 1 drink e.g. beer, wine, or soft drink, 1 snack e.g. chips/crisps or confectionery).\"",
      "Over the last few years, local Mancunians have argued they are being priced out of attending matches at Old Trafford, and United received intense backlash over ticket prices last term.",
      "United made the mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game in the Premier League, with no concessions for children or pensioners.",

      "Manchester United introduced Sesko alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon, with the loudest cheer reserved for Sesko after his £66.4million arrival from RB Leipzig.",
      "The official announcement of Sesko's transfer came on the morning of the game. Sesko arrived in Manchester on a private jet on Thursday evening and completed his medical the following day. United deserve huge credit for wrapping up the deal in a no-nonsense fashion, despite competition from Newcastle.",
      "Sesko has been signed to help sharpen United's attack. United scored a measly 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Sesko scored almost 50 per cent of that total (21 goals) in all competitions.",
      "Hojlund contributed just four league goals in 2024/25. The Denmark international was overlooked for Mason Mount against Fiorentina, which felt like another nail in the coffin for his United career.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Hojlund during the United States tour and his performances were better. However, Amorim sent a message by starting Mount as the false nine and naming Hojlund on the bench against Fiorentina.",
      "Hojlund's prospects of another season in Manchester don't look good when he isn't chosen to start when Sesko isn't in the squad, and he is overlooked for a midfielder in his position.",
      "Mount worked hard, but he did not provide a focal point at the tip of the attack and Hojlund probably would have done a better job, which suggests Amorim does not have him in his plans.",
      "Amorim even rejigged his front line for the second half, moving Mbeumo from the right into the middle. Hojlund was overlooked for the second time and ended the game as an unused substitute.",
      "The 22-year-old won't have watched Sesko's unveiling with a smile on his face because the arrival of the Slovenia international is expected to lead to his departure from the club.",
      "In different chats with journalists throughout the summer, Hojlund has reiterated he wants to stay and fight for his place, but the decision could be taken out of his hands. United are prepared to listen to offers in the region of £30m for Hojlund and a loan offer could also be considered.",
      "It wouldn't have been easy for Hojlund to watch Sesko being paraded at Old Trafford, the signing who could bring an end to his time in Manchester.",
      "Hojlund regressed spectacularly last season. He was certainly not the only underperformer, but his regression was stark and contributed to United's biggest problem: their lack of goals.",
      "It was also interesting to hear Amorim speak about Sesko before kick-off. \"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" he told MUTV. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "Amorim's selection against Fiorentina showed he does not believe Hojlund has the \"characteristics\" that United need. Hojlund had last season to convince Amorim and his audition was unsuccessful.",
      "However, it is slightly ironic that Sesko has a similar profile to Hojlund. They are the same age and Sesko is unproven in the Premier League, so his signing does come with a degree of risk.",
      "United need Sesko to achieve much more than Hojlund has during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Neil Wood has been praised by Fergie, trained alongside Roy Keane and fired by Gary Neville.",
      "He came through and coached at Manchester United's academy, played amid war-damaged buildings in Bosnia and is now splitting coaching duties between Trinidad and Tobago's men's team and Canada Women's national team.",
      "You won't find many folk with more United connections than Wood. He spent more than two decades at Old Trafford all told before leaving his role as Under-23 manager - where he played a part in the development of Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Anthony Elanga to name a few - to become Salford City boss under the ownership of Gary Neville, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.",
      "He was axed by his United alumni after just 18 months in charge, a decision that Wood still feels was harsh given Gary Neville and Giggs sent on messages following his dismissal citing how impressive the football style and training sessions were.",
      "\"It is a results business but I am pretty sure if I had stayed we would have been fine. For me, it needed a bit of patience.",
      "\"The first season was really successful. The owners asked me to create a playing style, bring the culture of the club together and improve the players and the team, which is exactly what I did. We got to the play off semi-final against Stockport (losing on penalties).",
      "\"I had spent a year building a playing style and in the second year I wanted to build on it. But some players were brought in that didn't fit the style.",
      "\"At the time (Gary) Neville was CEO but then he stepped back and Nicky Butt took over and then Ryan Giggs came in as sporting director. They were always around, and in a supportive way. But they all see the game differently, there were all different types of players so it is only normal to like different things in different players. That was the challenge. Sometimes you were stuck in the middle.\"",
      "Wood has since taken on roles with Canada's women's team - working alongside former Manchester United Women boss Casey Stoney - and Trinidad and Tobago's men's team, where Dwight Yorke is the head coach.",
      "Those two jobs mean the passport is seeing plenty of action as he potentially gears up for a men's World Cup next summer, a women's World Cup the year after and then the 2028 Olympics.",
      "\"It has been a new challenge and a new environment which I have really enjoyed,\" says Wood of his unusual job split.",
      "\"I am experiencing different tournaments, the preparation and delivery, not having a lot of time with the players, players coming in from different countries, all from different levels, all playing different ways at their clubs. There is always adaptability and trying to get the best out of the players you have got and try and improve them individually and improve the team.",
      "\"I feel like I have experienced a lot and that is part of the reason I have taken on these new roles. I’m always thinking, 'What can I learn? What is different?' I have the experience of coming through at United as a player of suffering bad injuries, and then into coaching.\"",
      "It was at United as a promising midfielder that Wood's football career began. He was a local lad, playing for his boyhood club and impressing as a talented teenager. He was training with the first team at 17 and mixing with the likes of Roy Keane and Juan Sebastian Veron before injuries halted his progress.",
      "\"I left school in July and went into pre-season and by Christmas I was training with the first team,\" he recalls. \"I was training with the first team every day at 16/17 and the speed and level was incredible. Then I had some injuries which just set me back a couple of years and by that time people had overtaken me a bit and it was difficult to get back.\"",
      "Instead, Wood spent time out on loan before leaving permanently for Coventry. But his spell there and subsequent time at Blackpool and Oldham saw regular injuries and limited playing time.",
      "It resulted in a move to Sarajevo to join Željezničar, a switch that rekindled Wood's love of the game and set him on his coaching path.",
      "\"I ended up going to Sarajevo,\" explains Wood. \"I did a year there but it was the first club since leaving United where I got coached. We had a Serbian manager who had worked for a long time with Javier Clemente, the old Spain coach. He worked off the Spanish model and it wasn't 4-4-2, it was quite tactical, there was video analysis, he would sit down with you and try to improve you.",
      "\"That was a massive learning curve for me and I was really glad that I did it, it opened my eyes to different ways. Sometimes I would play centre midfield, sometimes I was left wing back and all of a sudden I was getting the ball in space and the penny was dropping on the different ways to play football.",
      "\"That is what ignited my road to coaching. I stopped playing in England because I stopped enjoying it, injuries didn't help with my knees, but when I went into coaching I always tried to implement something different to the traditional English style.",
      "\"Zeljeznicar was the working class club of the city, they had a group of fans called 'the Maniacs' who used to go everywhere.",
      "\"I lived where I could walk to the stadium. You could see the high rises where it had been shelled from the war, but the people were so friendly and it was a great city.\"",
      "Wood returned to England and started on a path in coaching, initially working for free at Aston Villa with age-group sides before United came calling and he began to work with a talented crop of kids who would go on to become household names.",
      "\"When I first went back I was doing the Under-14s,\" he said. \"Elanga was Under-13s, Angel Gomes was there, Rashford was in the 16s. I followed the age groups up to 23s almost with the same group of players.",
      "\"Anthony (Elanga) going to Newcastle is a great move for him, Alvaro (Fernandez) going to Real Madrid is amazing for him and his family.\"",
      "Wood worked with Amad when he first moved to Old Trafford, along with Garnacho, while he gave Shola Shoretire and Kobbie Mainoo their first taste of European football in the Youth League.",
      "\"When Amad first came, we didn't know too much about him and he had a big price tag,\" recalls Wood. \"He would train with the first team but play with the 23s. Leading up to games he would train with us and straight away you could see his talent.",
      "\"He was quiet, learning the language, and it is not easy. The lads loved playing with him, he was intelligent and smart. He just needed a bit of time, did really well at Sunderland and when he came back you were just waiting for him to get his chance and when he did, he took it.\"",
      "Amad's future at United is bright, for Garnacho this summer looks like the end of the road for him at Old Trafford, something Wood feels is a shame.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",
      "Also full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.",
      "Get your copy NOW",
      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" surmises Wood. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "And with that our conversation concludes. Wood's next test comes in the form of Trinidad and Tobago's World Cup qualifying campaign next month. A journey that started at The Cliff will next take in Curaçao. The passport will be ready.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Sunday, August 10.",
      "The Reds have played their final pre-season fixture of the summer this weekend, drawing 1-1 with Fiorentina at Old Trafford before winning a penalty shootout. Now, all the attention turns to the new Premier League campaign and the visit of Arsenal a week today.",
      "One man who could be involved is Benjamin Sesko after he was unveiled to the United fans at Old Trafford on Saturday prior to the clash with the Italian giants. His arrival has led to more question marks surrounding Rasmus Hojlund who did not feature against Fiorentina.",
      "Elsewhere, Gianluigi Donnarumma continues to be linked with United while his situation with PSG remains unclear. Meanwhile, Brighton's Carlos Baleba is believed to be an option to add further bite to the midfield.",
      "Amidst all of this, Alejandro Garnacho continues to be focussing on a move to Chelsea and uncertainty remains over the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Take a look at all the latest United transfer news throughout the day, below...",
      "Speaking to Rousing the Kop, journalist Graeme Bailey has insisted that Liverpool currently have no plans to pursue Carlos Baleba.",
      "It is believed to be true that they are great admirers of the Cameroonian but that is thought to be the case of every major European club.",
      "While they have also been credited previously with trying to sign Baleba, even before he moved to Brighton, Slot is thought to be happy with Gravenberch in that position and has no plans to replace him.",
      "MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Hojlund would be open to leaving United before the end of the transfer window if he felt that there was no chance of him playing regularly this season.",
      "Now, talkSPORT have corroborated that stance suggesting that Hojlund has reluctantly agreed to leave Old Trafford.",
      "They add that RB Leipzig discussed a separate deal for Hojlund after Sesko left but the Dane was not keen on the move.",
      "Now that United have brought in Sesko, attention turns to United's next priority.",
      "We are one week away from the new Premier League campaign so let us know your thoughts on the transfer window in our poll below.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have maintained contact with Baleba's agents regarding a potential deal.",
      "United reportedly see Baleba as their perfect midfield signing this summer and are in constant talks about his wages.",
      "However, Brighton insist that Baleba is not for sale and will reportedly make life difficult for United.",
      "The Reds are willing to try and bring him in though.",
      "Adding to their earlier story, ESPN confirmed on Saturday that PSG have signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille to replace Donnarumma.",
      "The goalkeeper has signed a five-year contract in the French capital and PSG have no intention of keeping Donnarumma at the club.",
      "It is understood that Donnarumma wanted to extend his contract and receive a wage rise on his approximate £183,000 per week contract but PSG were unwilling to do that.",
      "ESPN understands that PSG are now awaiting bids from United, Chelsea and Inter for Donnarumma this summer.",
      "The French club have spoken to the Italian's agent and suspect that the Reds will make their move soon.",
      "Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract in Paris.",
      "Speaking to MUTV after the draw with Fiorentina, Amorim did not mention Hojlund directly but did address the striker situation.",
      "We struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player [Sesko], so we'll see.",
      "Sesko has arrived on a £74m deal this weekend from RB Leipzig.",
      "Alternatively, they would consider a loan so long as an option to purchase him next summer was attached.",
      "Hojlund has repeatedly insisted that he wants to stay and fight for his place in Manchester but that looks less and less likely by the day.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, AC Milan are the club most interested in signing Hojlund this summer.",
      "It is understood that they are discussing the finances involved in purchasing the Dane.",
      "The Reds are believed to want a loan fee valued at £5.1m with a buy option for next summer at £38.9m.",
      "Hojlund looks to be on his way out of the club.",
      "He did not play a single minute in the draw with Fiorentina on Saturday and his replacement was unveiled to supporters prior to kick-off.",
      "The Dane was overlooked in preference to Mount as the false nine which is arguably the biggest sign that his future is not in Manchester.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Mason Mount has welcomed Benjamin Sesko to Old Trafford after playing in his position against Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "The Reds' new centre-forward flew to Manchester on Thursday evening and completed his medical and final pieces of paperwork, on Friday. Saturday morning, United announced their new acquisition from RB Leipzig with £74m splashed on the Slovenian.",
      "His arrival brings to an end long-term interest in Sesko that began three years ago while the centre-forward was featuring for RB Salzburg. The 22-year-old was not purchased in time to feature against the Italian club but was unveiled to fans before kick-off at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "With Sesko absent, Ruben Amorim chose to play Mount in a false nine position which did not work to great affect. Speaking after the match to MUTV, Amorim admitted: \"We struggled without a reference as a striker.",
      "\"We have a new player [Sesko], so we'll see.\" Following the draw and eventual penalty shootout victory over the Florence club, Mount took to social media to welcome Sesko to his new home.",
      "\"Welcome to the family brother,\" he wrote on Instagram while sharing a picture of Sesko's broad smile in front of the Stretford End. It remains to be seen whether the 22-year-old new recruit will be ready to start the opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal next weekend.",
      "That decision will perhaps rest on how Sesko performs in training this week in the lead-up to the season opener on Sunday, August 17. One player who could start is Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "However, he did not feature against Fiorentina amidst reports that AC Milan are pushing to bring the Dane in on loan. Other options available to Amorim include Chido Obi and Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "Fiorentina took the lead early in the first half through Simon Sohm, who was unmarked from a corner. United quickly responded thanks to a Robin Gosens own goal, but the game ended 1-1.",
      "A penalty shootout followed which United won 5-4 to lift the Snapdragon Cup.",
      "Here are some of the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Excitement over new signings",
      "The signing of Benjamin Sesko was announced on the morning of the Fiorentina friendly. United agreed a €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons deal to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig, despite competition from Newcastle, and he was introduced to the Old Trafford crowd before kick-off.",
      "There is nothing more exciting for United fans than a multi-million pound signing being unveiled at Old Trafford ahead of a new campaign.",
      "Sesko was unveiled alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon. The four new signings were photographed in the centre circle and there was real buzz in the stands.",
      "United have overhauled their forward line in a single window and the prospect of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko combining is an exciting one. United scored just 44 league goals last term, and it's a problem they'll hope to have solved.",
      "Mbeumo's embrace with Amorim",
      "Mbeumo's first appearance for United in the US was delayed. He finally started in the last Stateside friendly and it was encouraging to see him play over 70 minutes against Fiorentina.",
      "The 26-year-old has been gradually getting up to speed after training on his own with Brentford while his United transfer was being finalised.",
      "Despite not being at peak fitness, Mbeumo looked sharp against Fiorentina and that bodes well for the season ahead. He received an embrace from Amorim when he was substituted and will be a force to be reckoned with when he is 100 per cent fit.",
      "Brilliant reception for De Gea",
      "It was heartwarming to see David de Gea receive such a brilliant reception when he emerged to warm up, with the goalkeeper returning to Old Trafford for the first time since leaving the club in the summer of 2023.",
      "De Gea made 545 appearances at United, won the Premier League title, the FA Cup, two Carabao Cups and the Europa League.",
      "De Gea is a modern club legend and thoroughly deserved to be honoured ahead of kick-off. Bruno Fernandes handed over a gift from the club and he looked overwhelmed as Alan Keegan (the voice of Old Trafford) read out his achievements.",
      "The new corner routine",
      "Carlos Fernandes has been in charge of set-pieces since Amorim's appointment in November and he's a presence on the touchline whenever United have a set-piece",
      "So what has Fernandes been working on throughout the summer? United have added Mbeumo, whose deliveries are excellent, and it's no surprise that a new corner routine was on show on Saturday.",
      "Shortly after United equalised, they came close to taking the lead through Leny Yoro. Mbeumo was responsible for playing the ball into the box after linking up quickly with Amad.",
      "Mbeumo played a short corner to Amad, who returned the ball, and that created a better angle for a delivery. Yoro almost scored from the ball into the box and it's a routine we can expect to see more of.",
      "Martinez closing in on a return",
      "Lisandro Martinez is still recovering from the ACL injury he suffered against Crystal Palace in February. Martinez has been on an individual programme at Carrington and is progressing with his recovery.",
      "The defender travelled to the US to be around the squad during the tour. He was in the directors' box at half-time against Fiorentina, taking time to greet fans as they took selfies with the United star.",
      "Martinez has suffered a number of different injuries during his three years in Manchester but he remains a popular figure.",

      "Manchester United are just one week away from the start of the Premier League season and murmurings of optimism are starting to filter through the fanbase.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig this weekend has provided excitement and arguably completed United's first choice attack for the upcoming season. A front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko means there's plenty to look forward to.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim cut a disappointed figure after the clash with Fiorentina on Saturday. He admitted that his side needs to be better in the forthcoming campaign and, ultimately, for all the positivity surrounding the club, there is a feeling that United still need to tick a few things off the Portuguese head coach's wishlist if they are to confidently state that this has been a good window for the Reds.",
      "First up, and arguably the only necessity left, is to bring in a central midfielder. Sadly, United are still lacking that bite in midfield behind the two No.10s at present.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is more than likely going to be playing deeper this season to accommodate Mbeumo and Cunha so United need an impressive defensive midfielder who is going to do the dirty work. Currently, those options are Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Firstly, Mainoo is not that kind of player and would much rather be used as competition for Fernandes in that position or further forward still. Casemiro is arguably too far past his best to be doing that role week in, week out in the Premier League.",
      "He excelled at times in the Europa League last season but if United want to progress, it is probably without the Brazilian in their team. The jury is still out on Ugarte and there is a sense that he could do that role having played under Amorim before but, even if this is the case, he will need competition.",
      "Step forward Brighton's Carlos Baleba who is considered to be one of the Premier League's best in that position. The trouble is that the Seagulls are desperate to keep hold of the Cameroonian even if it is claimed that the 21-year-old is not fully shut off to the idea of moving to United.",
      "A potential alternative could be Morten Hjulmand having played that role most recently for Amorim at Sporting. In truth, he could be the more likely option for United.",
      "Next on the wishlist is the centre-forward position. Yes, we know United have just strengthened there but bear with us.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund looks set to be pushed out of the club against his own wishes now Sesko has arrived. If this is the case, United would be left with Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi as the realistic cover for the Slovenian.",
      "Zirkzee arguably plays better in the deeper No.10 role so only Obi is a recognised centre-forward and, in truth, we imagine that Amorim would rather let him continue his development in the youth system. The back-up striker addition would likely be a cheap option considering how much has been spent so far.",
      "It has been reported this weekend that Dominic Calvert-Lewin has sacked his agent in a bid to negotiate a move to Old Trafford, so he could be an option. Jamie Vardy on a short-term deal may also be seen as an alternative.",
      "Finally, and marked firmly in the 'nice to have' category is a new goalkeeper. There is no big budget for one but the Reds would be looking to bring in a new shot stopper if Altay Bayindir was to leave.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has been heavily linked with United and it seems destined that he will leave now PSG have signed a replacement for him. The French club are believed to be expecting United to bid for him but perhaps a loan is the most likely scenario.",
      "If that was the case, the Reds could sign Donnarumma for a nominal, goodwill fee in the summer considering his contract expires in 2026. Were that business be concluded, United could definitively state they had a good transfer window.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Manchester United to sign Carlos Baleba 'now,' responding to the transfer rumours on social media.",
      "The 21-year-old has emerged as a candidate to join United this summer, following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko. However, a report from ESPN may shatter any transfer hope for the Reds as Brighton will reportedly demand €120million (£104million) for the midfielder.",
      "On Saturday, Fabrizio Romano provided an update, stating that United have maintained contact with Baleba's agents about 'contract and salary.' Both United and the player 'want to move forward,' added the Italian reporter, but as things stand, there’s nothing concrete with Brighton.",
      "Nonetheless, Ferdinand has already shared his verdict on a potential move. Taking to X, Ferdinand wrote: \"Mobility in Man United attack. Let's gooooo! Baleba now pls,\" followed by a laughing emoji.",
      "He also shared a video in which he gave his opinion on the club’s transfers so far this summer. \"The mobility in the front areas now, is something, as a defender, I'm looking at and I'm thinking differently about Manchester United's front line,\" said Ferdinand.",
      "\"I'd be sitting there going, 'I'm going to have a physical presence up there, I'm going to have a physical test from all three positions and I've got people who can run and move up there - they're mobile, they're the things I was asking for, the last couple of years up there.",
      "\"More of that and you have to say, the recruitment team have delivered, they've absolutely delivered in that department, in terms of the mobility, the pace, the power. So now, who's next?",
      "\"Who's next going to be coming through the door? Three front men have come in the door, I think the fan base have to be pleased with that, and I think the recruitment team have to take great credit in that sense.",
      "\"But now, these guys have got to go and deliver. Ruben Amorim has to set this team up for this team to go and deliver now, what's behind that? Is there going to be more incomings?\""

During his United career, he once conceded 40 consecutive spotkicks, the nadir coming with the 11 that flew past him in the 2021 Europa League final. De Gea did save one on his final appearance for the club at Old Trafford. He was granted a rapturous standing ovation upon his removal.",
      "United completed a cup double: the Premier League Summer Series and Snapdragon Cup. Neither should adorn any of the alcoves the players walk past on the new stairwell at Carrington. They still played 'Glory glory Man United'. Any excuse.",
      "The attack is boxed off for United in this transfer window but uncertainty remains over the goalkeeper. Andre Onana, absent for their entire pre-season schedule, expects to be fit for the visit of Arsenal next Sunday. Altay Bayindir's United career is memorable only for his penalty saves in the FA Cup win at Arsenal and his denial decided the shootout.",
      "All four of United's summer recruits were paraded before kick-off, each afforded a flattering introduction. The loudest cheer was predictably reserved for Sesko, barely two hours after his £73.62million signing was confirmed.",
      "The players soon emerged and the Stretford End burst into a chorus of \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\". Despite more than £200million invested in the attack, United matchgoers are particularly grateful to Fernandes for sticking around for another season.",
      "Sesko will not struggle to make the starting XI next week. Ruben Amorim selected a strikerless side for the second match running and a United player did not get on the scoresheet until the spotkicks.",
      "The start was played at the glacial pace of Glyndebourne when United ought to be prepared for a Glastonbury experience against Arsenal next week. The walking football was punished in the seventh minute through Simon Solomon Junior Sohm's half-volley direct from a corner that drifted towards the edge of the area.",
      "Amorim has not had a consistent back three across pre-season. Leny Yoro has started in four of the five friendlies but this was Harry Maguire's and Ayden Heaven's second starts of the schedule. Heaven limped off in the second half, which could deprive him of a start against his former club and pave the way for the lean Luke Shaw to be recalled.",
      "Fernandes immediately demanded more urgency from teammates following the opening goal and United burst into De Gea's area for the first time. United's most threatening attempts tended to come from defenders. Yoro and Maguire drew routine stops from De Gea.",
      "As late as the 79th minute, Fernandes was cajoling the sheepish Patrick Dorgu, at risk of regressing. A minute later, Dorgu charged towards De Gea with more gusto than he had displayed in nearly 80 minutes.",
      "United's only senior striker cannot get in the team as he is on his way out. Amorim is no longer concealing his distrust of Rasmus Hojlund, benched for the third game out of five in pre-season and second in succession. To add insult to injury, Mason Mount, recruited as a central midfielder two years ago, was picked up front.",
      "Mount, possibly picked on the strength of his wonderful hit against Everton in Atlanta, has played in four different positions now for United. This still reflected more damningly on Hojlund, a sellable asset United are actively seeking buyers for. Hojlund was in a carefree mood during his warm up, opting for some ball juggling. He was completely unused.",
      "Given Mount has done little of note playing in positions he is familiar with in two years at United, he was never going to cut it in an unforgiving role so alien to him. The experiment lasted 45 minutes and Bryan Mbeumo moved up front for the second half.",
      "It would have been more beneficial for the players and signings to operate in the system with an actual striker up top and it spoke volumes that the equaliser was an own goal. The support striker for Sesko is Joshua Zirkzee, still injured and neither here nor there. Amorim considers him more of a No.10.",
      "De Gea marked his return with a reenactment of some of his iffy keeping in his first United season as he was bundled over from a corner. The ball bounced in off Robin Gosen's noggin amid a challenge from Yoro, who sympathetically helped his counterpart back to his feet.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad are quickly developing a telepathic partnership on the right-hand side. Cunha was not as prominent and held a lengthy conflab with Amorim during a stoppage in the 31st minute. Fernandes headed over a few minutes later for some additional guidance.",
      "Fernandes scored for the fourth time this pre-season in the shootout. There was nothing new there.",

      "Ruben Amorim described Mason Mount's work rate as \"unbelievable\" after the friendly with Fiorentina.",
      "Amorim named Rasmus Hojlund on the bench for the final pre-season friendly of the summer at Old Trafford, opting to start Mount down the middle in the false nine role instead.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was then moved into the middle for the second half, which meant Mount relocated to the right. Hojlund was an unused substitute and his future at Old Trafford is uncertain after Benjamin Sesko's arrival.",
      "Hojlund does not appear to be in Amorim's plans for 2025/26, but Amorim hasn't hidden his affection for Mount and briefly praised the midfielder again after the clash with Fiorentina.",
      "\"It's unbelievable,\" said Amorim on Mount's work rate. \"The way he works, moving all the time and he knows all the positions, but also the other guys. It was a good test to prepare for the first time.\"",
      "Amorim has been full of praise for Mount since his arrival in Manchester, even claiming he \"loves\" the former Chelsea man because of his desire to succeed.",
      "\"The first thing is he's [Mount] working really hard,\" Amorim said in November. \"Then you have to understand the human also - he wants this really badly, and that is the most important thing. He has proved he is a really talented player. He was a European champion, so we believe in him a lot.\"",
      "Mount has suffered a few minor muscle injuries since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, but he enjoyed a clear run at the end of last season and started in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Speaking in the US during United's pre-season tour, Mount said: \"He [Amorim]'s definitely given that confidence to me from the first day he came in, speaking to me, and I know what he wants, and I feel like I know how he wants the team to play. And, obviously, I've had some experience in that role [No.10] as well.",
      "\"So that helps with the younger lads coming in and me helping them understand the positions of the formation and everything. So yeah, it's been brilliant and definitely having that confidence, the manager has that confidence in me to go out there and perform, it definitely helps as a player.\"",
      "Mount also backed himself to earn a place in Amorim's starting XI, despite the arrivals of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself,\" he said.",
      "\"I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that. Obviously with the new signings coming in, they [Cunha and Mbeumo] are going to elevate us to another level and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has revealed he is excited about the project at Manchester United.",
      "Sesko emerged as United's priority striker target over the last fortnight and his €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons transfer was officially announced on Saturday.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko also attracted interest from Newcastle, who will compete in the Champions League in the new season. The Magpies offered a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but Sesko wanted a move to Old Trafford.",
      "In a statement, Sesko said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin’s career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "“Working under the guidance of Ruben and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.”",
      "Sesko underwent his medical to complete his move to United on Friday, following his arrival in Manchester on Thursday evening.",
      "The striker scored 21 goals in 45 appearances for Leipzig last season and attracted interest from Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, but the Gunners pivoted to sign Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Sesko had the opportunity to sign for United in the summer of 2022 and his agent, Elvis Basanovic, visited Carrington, but he signed for Leipzig from fellow Red Bull franchise FC Salzburg instead.",
      "The Slovenia international could make his United debut against Arsenal next Sunday.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United are expected to prioritise a new midfielder to add to Ruben Amorim's evolving squad after completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The striker finalised his transfer from RB Leipzig, for a fee of €76.5million (£66.5m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons. Sesko has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford and strengthens Amorim's forward line further.",
      "After previously signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United have been busy during the summer transfer window. And with just over three weeks until the transfer window closes, they could welcome in one more new face.",
      "Prior to Sesko's confirmed arrival, Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba was linked with a move. The Athletic said that United have made contact with the Seagulls - via intermediaries - over the possibility of a move for the Cameroon international.",
      "Any potential move isn't expected to be easy, however, with Brighton said to want around £100million. It means alternatives are, rightly so, being considered and one of them is claimed to be Crystal Palace star, Adam Wharton.",
      "The Englishman has been tentatively linked with a move to Old Trafford since his switch to Palace. Various reports have stated that Wharton has a gentleman's agreement with the Eagles to leave next summer.",
      "Previously, it was understood that Palace valued Wharton at £60million. But the latest figures released by the CIES Football Observatory reckon the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Using a sample of over past 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable.",
      "That's quite a decrease in what many would expect the midfielder to leave the London club for. Wharton cost the club £18million in 2024 and he's only got better since then.",
      "However, even if the fee was £60million, that is still drastically lower than the valuation that United would have to match to sign Baleba this summer.",

      "Manchester United have completed their third signing of the summer in the form of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old was officially announced on Saturday ahead of their final friendly against Fiorentina. Sesko completed the move from RB Leipzig, signing a five-year deal and snubbing a move to Newcastle United in the process.",
      "But their transfer business is not set to stop there, with the summer transfer window only closing on September 1. Carlos Baleba has emerged as a potential target, but Brighton & Hove Albion have reportedly valued him at £104m.",
      "Elsewhere, The Telegraph has suggested United are still in the market for a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper before the deadline.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport brings you the latest headlines from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "ESPN report that Paris Saint-Germain are anticipating offers from United, Chelsea, and Inter Milan for Gianluigi Donnarumma after holding talks with Enzo Raiola, the goalkeeper’s agent.",
      "The French champions, who have signed Lucas Chevalier, are keen to sanction a sale for the Italy international. Donnarumma, who was reportedly open to extending his contract with PSG - which has just one year remaining - struggled to reach an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraph claims the club will look to sign a new goalkeeper having now finalised their pursuit of Sesko.",
      "MEN Sport says: United should definitely consider making a move for Donnarumma, who has extensive experience both domestically and in Europe, having won the Champions League last season, along with delivering outstanding performances in the competition. His leadership and commanding presence could greatly strengthen United’s defence, which has arguably lacked stability since the exit of David De Gea. This feels like the perfect moment to secure a long-term upgrade in goal.",
      "Internacional forward Ricardo Mathias has reportedly attracted interest from European clubs following his breakthrough at the Brazilian side. According to Globo Esporte, United sent a representative to scout the 19-year-old during Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Fluminense in the Brazil Cup.",
      "In addition to the Reds, an unnamed Premier League club has already expressed interest via a formal letter. Prior to this, the Brazilian outlet adds that Mathias was on the radar of PSV, though no talks over a potential transfer took place.",
      "He is under contract until the summer of 2028 and has a €65million (£56m) release clause attached.",
      "MEN Sport says: While signing a young player always carries some risk for clubs, Mathias offers considerable promise with many years of development ahead of him. Given his current release clause is reportedly set at £56m, there’s strong potential for his value to at least double in the coming years if he continues to progress and adapt to European football. So if United’s interest is genuine, investing now could make sense to secure a talented player before his market price skyrockets.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m earlier this week to complete a new attacking trident with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also joining earlier this summer.",
      "Man Utd have now addressed their lack of attacking capabilities from last season with only four Premier League sides scoring fewer goals than Ruben Amorim’s side as they finished 15th.",
      "Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee came in for lots of criticism with the duo scoring just seven Premier League goals between them last term.",
      "And now Hojlund looks likely to be the man to leave as Man Utd look to recoup funds after bringing in Sesko for big money with AC Milan reportedly interested.",
      "Before Sesko signed, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano hinted that Hojlund could be the man to leave if the striker signed from RB Leipzig.",
      "READ: Seven ways Manchester United have ‘huge advantage’ in title race revealed with Isak threat to fail",
      "Romano said last week: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "While Hojlund was publicly clear that he wanted to stay, he told reporters last week: “I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",

Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.",

      "“But at the moment, it’s not yet a concrete negotiation.”",
      "While there were other reports around the same time claiming that Man Utd had pulled out of a deal for the former Everton striker over a ‘major red flag’.",
      "It was understood at the time that ‘any potential deal is off as influential figures stopped short of engaging in prolonged discussions due to identifying his injury record as a major red flag when going in search of fresh firepower’.",
      "But now Caught Offside claim Man Utd are considering the England international ‘as back-up option’ ‘exploring the possibility of adding Calvert-Lewin to Ruben Amorim’s squad as a depth option in attack’.",
      "The website insist Newcastle could still be an option and add on Man Utd interest: ‘The new United boss is keen on having a strong rotational setup, viewing the former Everton man as a capable third or fourth-choice striker who could provide valuable cover across a long season.’",

      "",
      "So a poster asked where will everyone play.",
      "I think you can sort of tell how we will play and where everyone will play based on two things –",
      "1. Who we bought (more specifically their skillset)",
      "2. The history of the manager",
      "We bought a bunch of players who all have one specific skill in common, and we have sold a bunch of players who don’t have it.\nUnder klopp the aim was to either win it back quick or if in our own half move the ball up top quick, this is why midfield was often workhorses and Trent was leaned on heavily for his passing. It’s also why klopp went for Darwen (a striker who if he timed his runs better would score lots of goals in that system).",
      "We sold Trent, we sold Darwen, we will probably sell Elliot as well. And we brought in kerkez, frimpong, ekitike, wirtz and (maybe?) isak. Anyone see what they have in common?",
      "They are all very good players at carrying the ball through defensive lines, same goes for McAllister and gravenberch. Rather than launching the ball forward as we did under klopp slot will rely more heavily on players keeping the ball at their feet and moving with it or short fast passing.",
      "2. He is a Dutch manager, another thing all these players have in common is they can play dual roles. So the worries about where will wirtz play if we sign isak etc are a bit unfounded. There is likely going to be a lot of swapping and changing similar to what PSG did in the champions League and Cruyff’s Barcelona used to do. The reason is this is a very difficult system to man mark and players like Mac and Salah will benefit as teams can’t double up.",
      "Stop worrying. He won the league in his first year with no signings, I’m sure he has a reason for the things he’s doing.\nLee",
      "",
      "Why Manchester United can shock everyone and win the title\nThere’s a quiet confidence building at Manchester United, and for once it’s not based on nostalgia or blind hope. It’s built on a manager who’s had a full pre-season, three new attackers who each bring something different, and a schedule with no European distractions. Add in rivals with their own uncertainties, and there’s a genuine case to be made: United can go all the way this season.",
      "Rúben Amorim finally gets his clean slate",
      "When Amorim came in last season, he was thrown into the middle of a campaign with someone else’s squad. This summer has been different. He’s had the time to drill his principles, set his standards, and build the side in his image. Amorim has shown he can win trophies in Portugal, but this is the first time he gets to start from zero at Old Trafford.",
      "An attack that looks genuinely dangerous",
      "If there’s been one major weakness in recent seasons, it’s that United’s attack has felt predictable. That’s no longer the case.",
      "Benjamin Šeško: Tall, quick, strong in the air, and able to finish with either foot. A proper focal point.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Direct, tireless, and difficult to mark. His runs inside from the right create space and his delivery from set pieces is a weapon.",
      "Matheus Cunha: The link man. Good close control, clever movement, and the ability to knit attacks together.",
      "This isn’t just adding more goals. It’s adding different types of goals – headers, long-range efforts, first-time finishes, link play – so opponents can’t predict the threat.",
      "No Europe, no problem",
      "One-game weeks are a huge advantage. No Thursday night flights, no rotating half the team for the weekend. It’s more rest, more tactical work, and more energy for the Premier League. Leicester used that to shock the world in 2015/16. Nottingham Forest in 2024/25 spent months in the top four when nobody expected it. A clear calendar can make a massive difference.",
      "The element of surprise",
      "Last season’s United was not Amorim’s United. This is. Opponents don’t yet know how to deal with Šeško, Mbeumo and Cunha together. That unpredictability could fuel a strong start, and in this league, early momentum can carry a team a long way.",
      "The rivals aren’t invincible",
      "Liverpool have brought in new players, but it always takes time for signings to bed in. Manchester City were a little off their usual pace last season and there’s no guarantee they’ll be flawless this time. Arsenal remain strong, but still need to prove they can go the distance under real pressure.",
      "Momentum is everything",
      "Title races often swing on ten-game bursts where a team collects 25 points or more. United have the conditions to produce one of those runs early on – a fresh squad, a manager’s system clicking into place, and new signings bringing belief. Get that run in before Christmas and the title talk becomes serious.",
      "It’s not about being the best on paper",
      "City are still favourites on paper, Arsenal probably look more settled, and Liverpool’s attack remains dangerous. But titles aren’t won on paper. They’re won on the pitch, in the grind, when preparation meets opportunity. Leicester proved it in 2016. Forest showed last season that sustained form over months is possible even for an outsider.",
      "United have the manager, the variety in attack, the focus of a one-game week, and rivals who may not be at full tilt. Keep the key players fit and make the most of the early fixtures, and this could be the season Old Trafford finally gets to celebrate the Premier League trophy again.",
      "Not blind optimism. A real possibility.\nMustafa",
      "",
      "A head of the game\nLast week I was going to write in about how Arsenal needed to adjust their playing style to suit Gyökeres’. That is sit back and give the opposition the ball so we can break away. I know it’s only a couple of freindles but it would appear he’s quite happy to adjust to ours, especially with the class of Zubimendi on the teamsheet!",
      "Apparently Gyōkeres can’t head for toffee….maybe that’s because Sporting didn’t play that sort football. They sit back and play breakaway football and don’t cross the ball in…..we do and Gyōkeres capatilised on them. Xubimendi looks class too.",

      "First, and most importantly, the Serenity prayer states very clearly “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”",
      "I learned many years ago I cannot influence what goes on in the transfer market nor the management of my team and therefore decided not to worry about it. Yes I would like to see Newcastle sign more players, yes I would very much like Isak to stay, yes I would like the team to be strengthened but I have NO CONTROl over any of this so do not worry about it. I acknowledge this will anger the publishers of websites such as yours who depend on so-called fans rushing to agonise over every latest rumor, gossip, piece of misinformation regularly published in search of eyeballs for advertisements, but so be it.",
      "And second, I don’t think Newcastle United’s Inability to attract players is because the club is located somewhere near the Arctic Circle. As much as it pains me to say this, Sunderland appear to have done a really good job this summer bringing in new quality players (seven not including loanees) so I don’t think being located north of The Wall with WhiteWalkers our biggest fans plays much of a role here. I think in Newcstale’s case it has more to do with the breakdown in management since Amanda left. But again, I have no control over this, so do not worry.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – £66.2m/€76.5m (RB Leipzig to Manchester United, August 2025)\nThe hope is that Sesko can be enough of a success in his first permanent spell outside the Red Bull bubble to trigger a further £7.36m in add-ons in this ongoing Manchester United rebuild. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have set the bar high.",
      "",
      "13) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "14) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "15) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "16) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nTwo trophies, 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances might well have activated clauses taking the deal to the full £85m in cost but Liverpool will be thrilled to get half their money back from Al-Hilal in truth.",
      "",
      "17) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "18) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "19) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "20) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",

      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",

      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",

      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Lucas Chevalier – £34.6m/€40m (Lille to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2025)\nLike Jerzy Dudek in 2005, Gianluigi Donnarumma was granted a few weeks to bathe in the glory of a Champions League winner’s medal his heroics helped deliver before being informed he was surplus to requirements. If you don’t fall in line with PSG’s wage structure, you will be replaced.",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "8) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "9) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "10) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "11) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "12) James Trafford – £27m/€31.2m (Burnley to Manchester City, July 2025)\nBurnley are claiming that they have sold Trafford for a British record fee for a goalkeeper but City sources place the deal at £27m plus add-ons. Newcastle were willing to pay that sum but, not for the first time, their lure was far less than City’s.",
      "",
      "13) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "14) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "15) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "16) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "17) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko and could turn their attention to a Paris Saint-Germain star, while Newcastle United have bid for a centre-back…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly opens the door for Donnarumma’s departure, which was unthinkable when he was thwarting Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool in the Champions League. ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Chelsea\nIt’s pretty much a toss-up between the two…",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Biggest spenders in the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation.",
      "",
      "14) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Newcastle\nVilla were interested before they spent £26million on Evann Guessand and we know Porto will sell if the price is right, so this could be a go-er. Assuming Newcastle bank a fee for Isak, Porto will want as close as possible to the £86million release clause in the 21-year-old’s contract. Or at least something like the Toon were willing to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nNewcastle were reportedly ‘back in’ for Guehi, but they’re signing a different centre-back. Chelsea, meanwhile, are pursuing other targets, which gives Liverpool a clear run at the Palace skipper.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPoor Hojlund played zero minutes against Fiorentina in Saturday’s friendly as Benjamin Sesko was paraded to the Old Trafford faithful. A loan move appears the most likely for the Dane, and Milan are ‘on it’, says Romano.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet. And Newcastle have reportedly told a ‘furious’ Isak that he’s not leaving.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "5) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nWe have a Newcastle ‘Here we go’, and a player who ‘only wanted’ them. The end is nigh, folks.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",

      "The signing of Sesko was confirmed on Saturday and the Slovenian international was paraded in front of the United fans before they played Fiorentina in the Snapdragon Cup.",
      "After snubbing interest from Newcastle United to join the Red Devils, Sesko said: “The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",

      "Leipzig reportedly brought Hojlund up during the Sesko negotiations, but the 22-year-old is not keen on moving to the German club.",
      "A return to Italy is the most likely scenario for the former Atalanta striker, with Juventus, Inter and AC Milan all believed to be interested.",
      "United are clearly keen on shifting the striker before the transfer deadline on September 1 and head coach Amorim has sent him a ‘clear message’ by not playing him against Fiorentina on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Those are the words of transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano, who says Milan are ‘on it’ after Hojlund was an unused substitute.",

      "According to reports, three ‘vitally important’ factors helped Manchester United beat Newcastle United in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko‘s move to Man Utd was announced on Saturday morning after the Red Devils struck a deal with German outfit RB Leipzig worth around £73m with add-ons.",
      "Man Utd faced competition from Newcastle United for Sesko, though the Red Devils proved that their pulling power still exists by fending off their Premier League rivals to land the 22-year-old.",
      "Therefore, Sesko is the third Man Utd summer signing to snub Newcastle for the Red Devils, as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also favoured a move to Old Trafford over St James’ Park.",
      "After completing his move to Man Utd, Sesko revealed what “really excites” him about the Red Devils.",

      "READ: Man Utd move above Arsenal as Liverpool still the biggest spenders in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Now, a new report from Football Transfers reporter Duncan Castles has revealed ‘how Man Utd pulled off the Sesko masterclass’.",
      "There are said to be three ‘vitally important’ factors, while Man Utd also ‘threw in a sweetener’ for RB Leipzig.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The Red Devils will travel to the Bundesliga side in the future for a glamour friendly, which is expected to raise around €1.5m more for Die Roten Bullen.",
      "‘On the player’s part, Sesko will accept a lower wage at Man Utd than he was offered at Newcastle. Furthermore, the agent also accepted a lower commission for his client to sign for the Old Trafford side.",
      "‘The involvement of Man Utd director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was also vitally important for this transfer. The German maintains a close relationship with Sesko and his representative, having previously worked with them in the Red Bull system.’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on the progress of Benjamin Sesko’s medical ahead of his move to Manchester United.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has raised two concerns with Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko, but he has backed the 22-year-old to shine for the Red Devils.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down."

      "With Spurs confirming the worst about James Maddison’s ACL injury and Thomas Frank offering a gloomy update on the fitness of Dejan Kulusevski after a 4-0 pre-season friendly defeat to Bayern Munich, it looks certain they will have to go back into the transfer market to do something about their moribund attacking options.",
      "Even the seemingly perfect – if emotional – end to Son Heung-min’s Tottenham career looks slightly different in the light of Maddison’s serious injury. The mischievous among you might well ask whether Spurs would even still have sanctioned his exit had the cat not been so entirely out of the bag before that game against Newcastle in Seoul.",
      "That’s a hypothetical, though, and what Spurs need is something real. Worth remembering they were pretty keen on signing Morgan Gibbs-White even before this Maddison setback. That ended… badly for Spurs. They could really do with at least one of these ending rather better over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "Nico Paz (Como)\nThere are conflicting reports about the seriousness and even existence of Spurs’ interest in the Como playmaker, but there would be something amiss if the 20-year-old wasn’t at least on their radar even before the last week’s unpleasantness.",
      "He would appear to have all the necessary tools for Spurs’ needs, but it’s a deeply difficult deal to do at a price Spurs are going to like with his former club Real Madrid entitled to 50 per cent of any fee and in keen and observant possession of a buy-back clause.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nPerhaps not the most exciting of the options within the Premier League but in some ways the most interesting. After the way Elliott starred for England U21s this summer we really are incredibly keen to see what he can do given a full season of proper first-choice, first-team responsibility and there’s a compelling case that Spurs would now be the most fascinating place for that to happen.",
      "There really isn’t another club right now that can offer the same mix of opportunity and big stage for Elliott to prove he can take his age-group dominance into senior football.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with being happy as a vital and useful squad member at this excellent Liverpool side, but it does feel like he could be so much more somewhere else.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Man City)\nIt seems like he’s going to be a key figure in the final weeks of the transfer window. It’s felt like everyone’s been playing a waiting game with Grealish this summer. We all know he’s going to leave City; the question is when and where to.",
      "We get the sense that he’s not yet ready to commit to the kind of teams that might have him at the top of their shopping list, and the teams he might be ready to commit to haven’t yet worked down their list of targets far enough to reach him.",
      "But the time where this game of chicken ends feels closer than ever after that Maddison injury. Even if it doesn’t kick Spurs into desperate action to find out whether the Aston Villa playmaker version of Grealish is still there lurking within the Guardiola automaton, it will surely make other interested parties get a wriggle on.",
      "We’re really not sure we want to see this one, purely because it would mean finding a new player to take second place on our list of the most Spurs player never to actually play for Spurs. Top spot is and always will be, of course, Stewart Downing’s.",
      "",
      "Ebere Eze (Crystal Palace)\nTottenham’s interest here is long-standing but Arsenal appear to have stolen a march on their local rivals this summer. But that deal remains undone and the chance for Spurs to make another move of their own is still there.",
      "Can they offer what Arsenal can? They cannot, but that cuts both ways. They can certainly offer him an easier route to unquestioned first-choice selection for 50-odd games in a World Cup year, for instance.",
      "As ever when talking about potential departures from Palace this summer, though, it is worth noting that they themselves are neither desperate nor particularly keen to sell any of their FA Cup-winning stars at this time. This will not be a cheap option.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nAnother high-class option where the interest is long-standing but the attentions of a London rival may render it moot. Chelsea have appeared Simons’ likeliest destination for most of the summer, and again the only real card Spurs have to play is in offering fewer existing players standing in his way.",
      "And that feels like it’s got more chance of counting for something with Eze than it does Simons. And we’re not sure it’s got that much chance with Eze.",

      "",
      "Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)\nRogers’ name popped up briefly in connection with Spurs earlier in the summer and there’s a good chance the boat has been missed here, with any deal far more likely before the PSR deadline than after it.",
      "He also limped out of Villa’s 4-0 friendly win over Roma on Wednesday night, raising doubts about his participation in the early weeks of the season. Something that might, counter-intuitively, not be the worst news for Villa in the long-term.",
      "They remain keen to tie him down to a new contract but are surely primed to expect at least a phone call from London. One that very likely also mentions the words ‘Jacob’ and ‘Ramsey’.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nReality bit for Mainoo in a difficult 24/25 season and there remain doubts about where he best fits into Ruben Amorim’s system at Manchester United. Is he physical enough for a role in the midfield double-pivot? Is he creative enough to be one of the two number 10s?",
      "After a summer full of talk suggesting he could be on the move, the tone has shifted. It now appears more likely he’ll remain at Old Trafford for now, but with United continuing to chuck all sorts of money at all sorts of players it does still feel like some will need recouping somewhere along the way; Mainoo could yet emerge as something of a spare part.",
      "Whether he’s exactly the sort of player Spurs need to take on such a significant creative burden in what currently looks like a team of honest plodders is less certain, but he does possess that Maddison-like ability to unlock a defence with a clever pass others might spot.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)\nLook, at some point in this kind of list it is an absolute and irrefutable law that you must pose the question “Who has done this job for the manager elsewhere?”",
      "Damsgaard might not have got the same attention as your Bryan Mbeumos or Yoane Wissas at Brentford last season, but he was a key figure in their attacking efforts and reached double figures for assists.",
      "Frank obviously knows all about a player who started 34 Premier League games for the Bees last season – and came off the bench in all the other four – and he wouldn’t command the price tag of many others on this list. At 25, he’s also a potential long-term rather than stop-gap solution.",
      "But he has five years left on his contract and Brentford’s interest in losing another key figure this summer – and this late on – would, we suggest, be fairly low.",
      "",
      "Lucas Paqueta (West Ham)\nThe very idea of Spurs signing anyone from West Ham was a ludicrous one until as recently as this very summer, and we’ll cheerfully concede that when the first talk of Mohammed Kudus joining Tottenham emerged in June we immediately dismissed the idea and assumed the Hammers and/or Kudus’ camp were simply trying to smoke out interest from elsewhere.",
      "But no. With West Ham no longer quite sure about Kudus after a Difficult Second Season, Spurs came up with a sum of money sufficient to overcome the Hammers’ intrinsic unwillingness to do business with the north London mob.",
      "With Paqueta now free to resume his career after being cleared of spot-fixing charges that looked set to land him a lifetime ban, talk has instantly resumed about whether that career will indeed continue at West Ham.",
      "He had been poised to join Man City before it all kicked off, and they have been mentioned again. In a move that could take out two of the 10 options here in one swoop, there has been talk of City using Grealish as a makeweight in that deal. And you have to concede that Grealish at West Ham feels, if anything, even more correct than Grealish at Tottenham. Although that could just be the colour scheme.",
      "",
      "Mason Mount (Manchester United)\nHas been one of Manchester United’s best players in pre-season, which is admittedly a little bit like saying the bread has been one of the most appealing elements of a dogsh*t sandwich, but still.",
      "It may be that he’s done enough to convince Amorim he can turn around his MAN UNITED NIGHTMARE rather than needing the seemingly inevitable ESCAPE ROUTE from it, but we do still find ourselves wondering where exactly a player whose career has shambled down a cul-de-sac fits in at United.",
      "Whether anyone looking to resurrect a career gone backwards would be wise or keen to attempt that challenge at this iteration of Tottenham is another valid consideration.",
      "Arsenal are looking to sign off the rest of their summer transfer business as they close in on two more transfers, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are still planning to make moves for Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",

      "Now, the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season – looks imminent to round out the attack.",
      "Once that move is complete, though finances might make it a struggle, United could look to improve the midfield. Caught Offside reports attention could be turned there, with Como midfielder Nico Paz looking ideal to add both quality and creativity to the Red Devils.",
      "After Tottenham began contact for the transfer, the report suggests United and Chelsea ‘could be next’. They state there could be a battle between the three sides for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’.",
      "Paz, in his first season with Como, scored six goals and assisted nine more in 35 games, and had his former side Real Madrid looking at him for a while before they reportedly opted against bringing him back.",
      "Paz is said to be valued around €70million (£60.6m), with it suggested there is a clause in place for him, as the report states Como would like to agree a new contract to remove those so they can cash in on him for more.",
      "Reports have suggested that Tottenham have already opened the bidding for Paz, at €40million (£34.6m) and it was said it was rejected, but those reports have been denied by Spurs sources.",
      "Though United are said to be showing strong interest, it seems it would be difficult for them to pay a big sum, given they have already parted with around £130million this summer, and another £74million will leave their account for Sesko.",
      "Chelsea too have paid big money for a lot of players this season, but they have also registered big sales, such as Noni Madueke and Joao Felix.",
      "As such, they might well be able to finance a deal for Paz, beating their Premier League rivals to the Spaniard’s signature.",
      "The report does also suggest there is a chance Real could activate their buyback clause for Paz, which is said to be much lower than what Como currently value him at.",
      "It rises by €1million each year, but will only reach €10million (£8.6m) by 2027, according to reports, so while Real are said to have left the scene for now, they might well be back at any point if Como don’t sell Paz."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "United are moving to improve upon a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term. They have signed two quality Premier League attackers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and are closing in on RB Leipzig star striker Benjamin Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Current United striker Rasmus Hojlund‘s future has been up in the air all summer, with United reported at times to be unsure whether to keep him or let him go after he struggled massively in front of goal last season.",
      "Transfer insider Romano has revealed that United have opted for something in the middle of those two options, as they have ‘definitively opened doors’ for his loan exit, but there’s a twist.",
      "Indeed, Romano suggests that Hojlund ‘insists on staying at United’.",
      "He states AC Milan are in contact with his agents to advance for the deal, with the Red Devils angling for a loan fee of €6million (£5.2m) as well as having Hojlund’s full salary covered.",
      "But there seems a chance the striker could refuse the move in order to prove himself at United. That would be hard, though, as opportunities are likely to be limited after last season’s four-goal Premier League return, and the presence of current striker Joshua Zirkzee and soon Sesko, too.",
      "United’s thoughts on Hojlund have changed recently, too, as Romano said of late: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "That differs from their current stance that the door is open for the striker to leave.",
      "Following on from that, it’s been suggested that Milan’s view is they’re ready to sign Hojlund, with United happy to see him go, but there’s been no green light from him, and it looks like it will stay that way.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Man Utd career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",
      "Man Utd are buying another Rasmus Hojlund this summer as Benjamin Sesko will “need to adapt” to the Premier League, according to Rene Meulensteen."

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 23:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 15:44, UK",
      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
