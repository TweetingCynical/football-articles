      "Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres got an immediate lesson in the challenges posed by the Premier League after his £64m summer move from Sporting Lisbon. The Swedish striker scored 54 goals in his final season in Portugal, but didn't even register a shot on his top-flight debut for the Gunners.",
      "It brings to an end a streak lasting some 28 months. Gyokeres registered at least one shot in every single one of his league appearances for Sporting, but failed to do so for Arsenal against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "You have to go back 69 games for the last time Gyokeres failed to register a shot in a league outing. According to BBC Sport, the game in question was Coventry vs Blackburn in the Championship, with the Sky Blues claiming a 1-0 win despite their leading man coming up short.",
      "Gyokeres was celebrating another 1-0 win on Sunday despite his personal struggles. Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game, capitalising on an Altay Bayindir error to nod home at the back post after a Declan Rice corner.",
      "Arsenal's new No.14 scored in pre-season during a win at home to Athletic Club. And, while he was made to wait in the league, manager Mikel Arteta recognised he wasn't the only one to find things tough.",
      "\"We came here away and won which is a big result. We were clearly not at our best,\" Arteta told Match of the Day. \"We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",
      "Arsenal's next game comes at home to Leeds United, who begin their own campaign against Everton on Monday night. Daniel Farke's side scored a league-leading 95 goals en route to promotion from the Championship last term so Arsenal may need to be at their best defensively once more.",
      "No team conceded fewer than Arsenal in last season's Premier League, with goalkeeper David Raya claiming the golden glove award. Raya needed to be sharp to snuff out a couple of United attacks on Sunday, but pointed to the team effort required.",
      "\"That's the willingness, the fight, the spirit that we have altogether, where things are not going our way and we make mistakes, everybody's sprinting back and trying to help the teammate that's made a mistake to recover the ball and to do the right thing,\" the Spaniard said. \"So we did that and I think we dug deep very, very well, especially the last 10-15 minutes where they threw everything to us and we defended very well, so that's credit to the team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United were unfortunate to lose to Arsenal because the winning goal should have been disallowed, according to Mark Clattenburg. United began their Premier League season with a 1-0 defeat by the Gunners at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal’s goal came from their first corner of the game as Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice’s cross over the line after Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball clear. Bayindir felt he had been impeded by William Saliba, but the goal was allowed to stand.",
      "The goal has seen a continuation of the debate over United’s goalkeepers, with Bayindir standing in for Andre Onana, who missed the game following an injury. Gary Neville felt Bayindir was at fault and needed to be stronger, but ex-Premier League referee Clattenburg had sympathy for the Turkey international.",
      "“In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal's goal,” he told United In Focus. “But when you watch it in slow motion, you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball. PGMOL said they would punish this type of challenge more, but again they failed.”",
      "His words echoed those of Ruben Amorim, who felt aggrieved that the goal was allowed to stand. He said: “I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Arsenal have become the masters of scoring from set pieces over the past few seasons and appeared to have identified United’s weakness. Saliba occupied Bayindir, who got a hand to Rice’s cross, but could only divert it into the head of an unmarked Calafiori at the back post.",
      "Neville has urged United to pursue Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is poised to leave Paris Saint-Germain. The ex-United defender believes the big personalities of the two keepers and their ability to cope with pressure would help his old club and Wayne Rooney agrees.",
      "Rooney said on his podcast: \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "However, Amorim insists he is \"happy with the three goalkeepers\" and added: \"I think we prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team. So I’m happy with the players.\"",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will hinge on whether Ruben Amorim brings in a new goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts. The Red Devils put on a vastly improved performance in their Premier League opener against Arsenal, despite suffering a 1-0 defeat.",
      "The Gunners found the net early in the first half through Riccardo Calafiori, after a blunder from keeper Altay Bayındır gifted the defender a simple finish at the far post. While United registered more attempts - both on and off target - and enjoyed better pass accuracy and completion rates, they failed to capitalise on this dominance for the remainder of the game.",
      "However, supporters will have been encouraged by Amorim's side throughout the first game of the 2025/26 campaign and the progress since the conclusion of last season.",
      "Ex-Newcastle legend Shearer hailed the performance of the Red Devils at the weekend, but issued a warning regarding their problem area between the sticks. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, the Premier League top scorer praised new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for bringing fresh energy into Old Trafford.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "At present, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton as their choice of shotstopper - yet neither Amorim nor supporters appear convinced by any of their options. Onana was regularly rotated with Bayindir during the previous campaign, with the pair conceding 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Onana failed to make the matchday squad for the opening fixture of the season, with 39-year-old veteran Heaton taking his place on the substitutes' bench instead.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma remains on United's wishlist, following his omission from the squad that travelled to face Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup last week.",
      "His deal in the French capital expires at the end of next season, meaning he could leave without a hefty transfer fee. Given the existing friction between player and club, it appears likely that the goalkeeper will exit Paris this summer for a reduced fee, though United's rivals Manchester City are currently frontrunners for his services.",
      "AC Milan's Mike Maignan is also on the Red Devils' radar as they consider a potential swap deal for young striker Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish forward has found himself out of favour with Amorim and looks set to bid farewell to Manchester this summer.",
      "In a surprising twist, it's been reported that David De Gea could make an unexpected comeback to United following the discovery of a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could see him depart for a cut-price fee.",

      "There has been talk of United going after a new shotstopper this summer and Donnarumma is a man on the market after falling out of favour at PSG. The Italian has just claimed the Champions League with the French side but is now looking to quit the club.",
      "United, as well as neighbours Manchester City, are both looking to make moves and Rooney insists it would be a massive missed opportunity if those at Old Trafford didn't try and land Donnarumma.",
      "He said on his podcast: \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "Rooney also believes the Euro 2020 winner would be a guarantee, even if he brings with him hefty wage demands. \"I don't think he's a risk. I saw a stat the other day - the errors leading direct to goals. His was zero,\" said the ex-United star.",
      "Ruben Amorim currently has Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton on his books. The latter is a veteran whilst question marks hang over the other two. Rooney admitted the Cameroon goalkeeper \"certainly didn't fill us with confidence last season\" after making numerous errors.",

Gary Neville is among those adamant that they need a new No 1 but Amorim believes Sunday's clash with Arsenal proves they can win Premier League games with their current crop of shotstoppers.",

      "Arsenal skipper Martin Odegaard gave the perfect response to Tony Adams' recent calls for him to be replaced as club captain. That's after the Norwegian enjoyed a performance fitting of the lead man in Arsenal's hard-fought 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "The Gunners travelled to Old Trafford not long after club legend Adams suggested Arsenal are \"not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.\" The retired defender, who won four league titles with Arsenal and captained the team for 14 years, suggested the midfielder isn't the man to end the club's Premier League drought after three straight runner-up finishes.",
      "Speaking at a recent live recording of the Indo Sport podcast, Adams said: \"I'm seeing Declan Rice as a captain, but I'm saying to Arteta, 'Come on, step up now. It's your time to be a winning manager and a fantastic manager, because you're not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.'\"",
      "Odegaard has since responded to those comments and given some insight as to how he looks to inspire his squad. However, he saved the most apt reply for Sunday's trip to Old Trafford, where he delivered a leader's display under massive pressure.",
      "The 26-year-old played a crucial role in getting Arsenal out of several scrapes and firing his side upfield in numerous quick transitions. He also made five clearances - only William Saliba (seven) made more among Arsenal players - and did a good job of calming matters when United looked like unnerving their guests.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta has also come to his captain's defence after retaining Odegaard as skipper. He recently revealed the matter was decided by a club-wide vote, and there was a heavy consensus the former Real Madrid man was their pick to lead.",
      "\"My opinion is clear, and it's not just my opinion - it's all the staff and especially the players,\" Arteta told reporters ahead of Arsenal's Premier League opener. \"I asked them to vote [for] the captain, and I got the result yesterday.",
      "\"By a mile away, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody was choosing the same person, Martin Odegaard, which is the most clear sign that you can have. It's how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win, so there’s no question about that.",
      "\"There is [a vote] every year especially because we change [personnel] a lot, and we change the leadership groups, because a lot of the players that were there are now gone. So we need to re-establish that and because it gives you so much information, how they feel about themselves and how they see [the captain] as a leader. It was really interesting to analyse all the data and to gather information.\"",
      "Sunday's Premier League curtain-raiser is of course just the first step to Odegaard truly proving he's the man to take Arsenal to silverware. But victory away to one of the club's greatest nemeses on the opening weekend of the new season is no bad way to start.",
      "\"There's always these small things you have to do. In general it's just how I see it is to get the best out of the team and how to give the team the right mindset. Help the players around you, get the best mindset in everyone.",
      "\"I think before the game just on the pitch I do a little one (team talk) and inside the dressing room we have different people talking. It's not just me there's a lot of people sharing the responsibility and the manager does a lot as well. It's a shared thing. It's not just me all the time.\"",

      "There are just two weeks to go before the transfer window shuts, and plenty of Premier League clubs may feel they have work to do in the transfer maeket. Among them are reigning champions Liverpool, despite the Reds making a winning start to the season on Friday.",
      "Arne Slot's side have already spent big this summer, breaking the Premier League transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz. Their defensive issues came into focus during the win over Bournemouth, though, and Slot could be tempted to reinforce further.",
      "Last season's runners-up Arsenal looked more solid at the back on Sunday as they pipped Manchester United. It was a tricky afternoon for new striker Viktor Gyokeres, though, and the Gunners may feel they need to give the Swede more support.",
      "United themselves were able to take some positives from their performance if not the result. Questions remain for them, thoughm especially in goal after Altay Bayindir's struggles for Arsenal's winner.",
      "United's need for a new keeper became more acute when Bayindir flapped at a corner to allow Riccardo Calafiori to score Arsenal's winner at Old Trafford. Fellow senior keeper Andre Onana didn't even make the bench, despite head coach Ruben Amorim indicating the Cameroon international wasn't injured, and a new starting keeper could well arrive this month.",
      "Emi Martinez is one option, with the Aston Villa keeper absent through suspension this week, while Gianluigi Donnarumma's future might hinge on how serious rivals Manchester City are about a deal and Inter Milan could beat United to cheaper target Senne Lammens.",
      "Further forward, Amorim is certainly a fan of Carlos Baleba as United seek out defensive midfield reinforcements. Brighton won't let the Cameroonian leave on the cheap, though, so United may need to sell before they can buy.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are among those who could fetch a fee, with Roma keen on both, but it could be that the pair follow Toby Collyer by leaving on loan rather than permanently. Harry Amass has also been tipped to leave on loan, with Diego Leon's arrival leaving United in better shape down the left.",
      "There are three more out-of-favour players who could leave permanently to potentially bring in funds for a Baleba swoop. Alejandro Garnacho is wanted by Chelsea while Real Betis remain keen on Antony, and AC Milan target Rasmus Hojlund looks closer to an exit after being left out of the squad to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal have been busy already this summer, taking a focused approach under new sporting director Andrea Berta. They're only likely to add one more senior star, if that, but midfield creativity looks to be the order of the day.",
      "The development of Ethan Nwaneri has seen the Gunners cool their interest in Eberechi Eze, with Tottenham now looking the most likely to sign the Crystal Palace star. Arsenal could yet make a last-gasp move for the England international, but the priority right now appears to be cashing in on fringe players to raise some funds - even if they don't end up spending it all right now.",
      "With Gabriel Martinelli starting at Old Trafford and Noni Madueke coming off the bench, Leandro Trossard looks to be the odd man out. There has been well-documented Saudi interest in the Belgian, though he may yet wait for an offer from Europe.",
      "Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson all spent time out on loan last term and all three could yet move for the right price. Vieira has been eyed by Stuttgart, and all that remains is agreement on the price.",
      "Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko could also leave if the right offer comes in, with Fenerbahce chasing Zinchenko. We could also see a late summer exit for backup goalkeeper Karl Hein, with Tommy Setford promoted from the under-21s into the senior set-up.",
      "You might look at a team spending £300m and think 'surely they're done for the summer'. Liverpool have also brought in a sizeable sum through sales, though, and this - combined with their lack of spending 12 months ago - leaves some wiggle room.",
      "The defending for Antoine Semenyo's goals at Anfield suggests a new centre-back could be crucial. Giovanni Leoni arrived too late to feature in that game, and is still a teenager, so Marc Guehi could yet join from Crystal Palace.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, Alexander Isak remains more likely than not to join Liverpool after Newcastle left him out of their squad to face Aston Villa on Saturday. We're unlikely to see any additional incomings, but Liverpool could still cash in on some fringe players.",
      "Ben Doak was left out entirely on Friday, and is due to complete a permanent move to Bournemouth. Kostas Tsimikas looks the next-most likely to depart after being relegated to third choice left-back, with Nottingham Forest among the interested parties.",
      "Harvey Elliott could also leave for the right price after staying on the bench against Bournemouth, though Federico Chiesa's goalscoring cameo has seen talk of a departure for the Italian start to cool. There could also be some more loan departures after Luca Stephenson's move north of the border, with James McConnell and Lewis Koumas both in demand.",

      "Ruben Amorim has drawn comparisons to Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson due to his ruthless approach to team selection. Former Red Devils star Wes Brown made the observation after the Portuguese boss demonstrated his willingness to make bold decisions since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 home loss to Arsenal on Sunday. And there were reasons for the hosts to feel encouraged as United created the majority of clear-cut chances despite succumbing to Riccardo Calafiori's early header.",
      "New arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha played the full 90 minutes in their United debuts, while Rasmus Hojlund was omitted from the matchday squad entirely. Altay Bayindir, whose display came under scrutiny from Gary Neville following his role in Calafiori's opener, was given the nod in goal amid ongoing speculation surrounding Andre Onana's future.",
      "Amorim, 40, has demonstrated his readiness to make courageous calls since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November 2024. Sunday's team sheet reinforced Brown's earlier comparison between the current manager and club icon Ferguson.",
      "\"He's signed a few players who can play in different positions, especially those who have done really well in the Premier League. That's a massive thing, something we've missed.\"",
      "Brown, who made his Premier League debut for United in 1998, joined the club's first team during a period of change under Ferguson. The legendary manager had guided the Red Devils to glory with stars like Gary Pallister, Brian McClair, Lee Sharpe and Steve Bruce in the mid-90s, but wasn't afraid to bid farewell when he felt it necessary.",
      "Onana and Hojlund were brought to Old Trafford by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023 for a potential combined fee of around £115million. Both are rumoured to be on their way out of United this summer, although Amorim insisted on Sunday that Onana's absence was due to a lack of training and fitness.",
      "Bayindir's inability to command his area from an early Declan Rice corner once again highlighted the goalkeeping issues at United. Despite struggles in attack, Mbeumo and Cunha showed promise, while new signing Benjamin Sesko could only do so much in his brief 25-minute appearance off the bench.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all left out of United's first squad of the Premier League season. Each of the four is expected to leave the club this summer, further demonstrating Amorim's confidence in his decisions.",
      "Academy graduate and ex-United poster boy Marcus Rashford has been loaned to Barcelona in another big call this summer. January signing Patrick Dorgu also made a strong impression on United's left flank on Sunday, showing Amorim's influence is gradually taking shape at Old Trafford.",
      "The last two weeks of the summer transfer window could bring even more changes, with some marketable players still officially part of the squad. However, Amorim's refusal to include them despite the pressure of the Premier League resuming demonstrates a firm commitment reminiscent of Ferguson himself.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Michael Carrick has explained why Scott McTominay struggled to reach his full potential at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old signed for Napoli last summer, winning Serie A and the league’s Most Valuable Player award in his debut season.",
      "McTominay scored 13 goals and provided six assists in 36 games last term, becoming an instant hero in Naples. This was a far cry from the criticism he faced during his time at the Red Devils, usually when he was part of a midfield pivot alongside Fred, with the duo being labelled ‘McFred’.",
      "There were standout moments during McTominay’s last full season at Old Trafford, scoring 10 goals in all competitions and often finding the net at crucial times for Erik ten Hag’s side. While many fans were surprised by McTominay’s ascendency at Napoli, Carrick, who was United assistant coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, admitted that the midfielder’s ability was always evident, even though he was made to play a slightly different position.",
      "“He was always, yeah, we had a bit of a kind of few discussions with it about Scott when we were coaching with Ole and we played a lot with him and Fred and actually had a lot of good success in many ways with the two of them,” Carrick said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “More defensively, yeah, he could, he was kind of the box-to-box, if you like, done a bit of everything, but more defensive.",
      "“But he was reliable, he was a fantastic attitude, great to work with. But he always had, and in training, he always had an eye for goal. He was a great finisher. Getting in the box, and he had that, I never really had it, but with certain lads, getting around the box is just that extra bit of time to finish.",
      "“Like a [Frank Lampard], you know? I know Lamps was obviously best of the best of that, but he's got a sense of that, getting in the box, and it drops to him, like it's goals, he's just finding that.",
      "“And he always had it, and we tried a couple of times, and just because of the make-up with the team, it didn't quite work at that time, but there was always something in there where you think, he's got goals in him, Scotty.”",
      "“I'm so happy that he's gone to do well, because he deserves it,” Carrick added. “I'm sad that it's not at United, because I think he's kind of the one that you want at the club, because he just drives everything, he's a heart and soul, but to see him go on and do well, it speaks volumes, and there's no one taking that. He's had ups and downs, big ups and downs, and he's gone on, and actually he's not looked back now. It's incredible what he's done.”",
      "The Scotland international rose through United’s academy and became a first team regular under Solskjaer by 2019, going on to win the FA Cup and League Cup as well as reaching the 2021 Europa League final. He made 255 total appearances for his boyhood club and Carrick was asked why McTominay was not trusted in a more attack-minded role until leaving for Napoli.",
      "“Make-up of the team, the dynamics, whatever,” Carrick explained. “Look at England, you know, you've had it with England over the years. Why does it not work with England? Sometimes it's not an individual thing, it's a dynamic, it's the make-up of the group, it's the atmosphere surrounding it, that's what I'm saying.",
      "“It's not always just about that football or that game, there's kind of feelings around it sometimes that affect everyone's judgement, you know, it's not always as straightforward as that.”",
      "While Carrick argues that McTominay occupied a deeper midfield role to help the balance of the team, the player believes he was misunderstood after stepping up to United’s first team. The 28-year-old was willing to play any position asked of him and backed himself to be more consistent than some of the club’s marquee signings, but this selfless attitude arguably prevented him from finding his best position in the United team.",
      "“When I got into the first team, I was quite misprofiled in where I was playing,\" McTominay told The Athletic in April. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there.",
      "\"But I was being used as a number six or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game. But when you're playing for Manchester United and you're 20, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at number eight ahead of Paul Pogba. It's not realistic.\"",
      "\"You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do,\" McTominay added. \"In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.",
      "\"They would always sign someone who wouldn't necessarily be what people expected them to be. My mentality was that I was always there, ready to go, ready to take my opportunity. I always wanted to prove my worth, to show I could play every game. It's not the sort of thing that affects me. You can only be in control of what you do.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has insisted he is happy with his goalkeepers despite Gary Neville claiming that their “glaring issue” will continue to undermine Manchester United’s efforts this season.",
      "United opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal on Sunday, with the only goal of the game coming from an error by Altay Bayindir. The United keeper flapped at Declan Rice’s corner, gifting Riccardo Calafiori a simple header to put the Gunners ahead.",
      "Bayindir started with Andre Onana not in the squad following a pre-season impacted by injury, while 39-year-old Tom Heaton was on the bench. Neither Onana nor Bayindir has convinced since joining the club and Neville was clear on his take.",
      "Speaking later on the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: “It’s a glaring issue at United that cannot be ignored and that is that they do need to find a goalkeeper. They have to, I’m absolutely unequivocal on that.",
      "\"In my 20 years at Man United we had two periods of seven or eight years with [Peter] Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and in between we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it’s really unsettling when you don’t have a dominant No.1 who is 6ft 2in, dominant in the air and owns his six-yard box and comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves one-on-one and saves you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "“I don’t know where they are on PSR, they seem to have a bit more money, they don’t need to magic up a bit more money in the next week or so, or do something on loan.”",
      "But asked if he was happy with his goalkeepers, Amorim was firm. “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal, and we were the better team,” he said.",
      "And pressed on whether they might try to sign one before the window closes in two weeks’ time, Amorim simply stated: “I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",
      "United have enquired about Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer and Neville believes either would be a big step up. “The two that you’d look at who were mentioned in the last week are Martinez and Donnarumma,” he said.",
      "“The reason I say that they would be good goalkeepers for Manchester United is not necessarily because I think they are the best goalkeepers in Europe or that they’re amazing, I think they’ve got big personalities and characters. You’ve seen Donnarumma in that European final for Italy save those penalties, he looked like a giant. You’ve seen him play for PSG in huge games under pressure.",
      "“You’ve seen Martinez play in a World Cup final and win a World Cup. They’ve played under extreme pressure and have big personalities and characters and almost walk out with an arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper and I think Man United need that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Mikel Arteta admits Arsenal now find themselves \"unsatisfied\" with wins at Manchester United despite previously going years without a success at Old Trafford in the Premier League.",
      "The Gunners got their season off to the ideal start as they battled to a 1-0 win over the Red Devils, who were the better team for large periods, but couldn't breach David Raya's goal. Riccardo Calafiori's early header ultimately settled the game with the visitors having to dig in.",
      "Patrick Dorgu hit the post in what was one of United's 22 efforts on goal with their new look attack causing numerous problems. Arsenal's defence held firm though and, like Liverpool and Manchester City, they begin the year with three points.",
      "Arteta admitted that Arsenal now leave Manchester with a feeling of dissatisfaction despite their win, which completes a huge turnaround given that Old Trafford was rarely a place they enjoyed success. Before Arsenal won their in 2020 they hadn't won a league game on the red side of Manchester for 14 years.",
      "Now Sunday's win marks their second win in their last three visits and Arteta said: \"Massive [to get the result], to come here with the atmosphere and the new signings. We have to be humble about how we scored the goal and game are won in both boxes which is what we did today.\"",
      "\"I look at the players faces and they want much more. We know that we are much better than certain moments we played. I think before I came here it was 18 or 20 years since we won at Old Trafford but now we come here and win many times and still unsatisfied. We need to be careful against a team who has the speed in the front line to threaten in that way.\"",
      "Arsenal are seeking to end a run of three successive second place finishes with their league title drought about to extend into a 22nd year. Arteta has invested again to end that run and was pleased that his side could secure three points despite being below their best.",
      "\"Well, that gives you certainly momentum and confidence - two very important things,\" he added. \"Because you know that when you know your standards in certain aspects, which today we weren't, being fair, we can still come away and find a way to win the game.",
      "\"And the team has to find that resilience throughout the season for ten months in different contexts to be able to do that. Of course, we have to improve a lot of things and that will happen very soon.\"",

      "Hart, who was a first choice for Manchester City and West Ham, was determined to try and defend his fellow goalkeeper but after seeing the replay was unable to find a justification as he criticised Bayindir for getting too involved with Arsenal defender William Saliba.",

It’s not a foul. Bayindir has got to scrap with his left arm to deal with Saliba and jab the ball away with his right.\"",

There were United Premier League debuts for £200million new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but David Raya left with a clean sheet.",
      "United struggled in the goalkeeping department last season, where Andre Onana was inconsistent, while they managed just 44 goals in 38 matches in 2024/25. Nevertheless, Amorim sounded a note of optimism post-match, claiming “we were not boring” – an analysis which was quickly dismissed by Keane.",

      "“The expectations around the club are so low now that everyone is almost happy.” Later he was asked to predict where his old club would finish. “Mid-table – 10th, maybe ninth,” he said.",

Players such as Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and, perhaps most heartbreakingly, Benjamin Sesko have all turned down moves to St James' Park.",

      "Despite numerous rejections, United have managed to secure the signature of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55million, reports Chronicle Live.",

      "Newcastle are also reportedly hot on the heels of Brentford forward Yoane Wissa, but it's hard to ignore the ongoing saga with superstar Isak.",

      "It seems unlikely that Isak will don the United jersey again after declaring his refusal to play for the club. However, Howe is keeping the door ajar for further discussions with Isak and the club, if he decides to engage.",

      "He was full of praise for his players after they had more than 60 percent of possession and also recorded 22 shots on goals - adamant that they were better than Arsenal as they stuck to their guns.",
      "Amorim told Match of the Day: \"We deserved more and we were the better team, that is clear but in the end we lost. We need to work on the things we need to improve. We need to defend set pieces. We did a lot things right.",
      "\"There are a lot of things without seeing the video that we need to work. I am really proud of my players. We were more aggressive and brave. In certain moments I think Bryan [Mbeumo] and Cunha helped a lot. We stuck to the plan even when the stadium is nervous, we continued to play the way we played and that will help us in the future.",
      "\"They [the fans] want that feeling again. We go to Old Trafford and we are not going to get bored. We need to win more than last season but they want to see something and feel something.\"",
      "United's display on Sunday was the first time in 14 years that they'd recorded more than 20 shots in a Premier League game. Ironically the last time that happened they beat Arsenal 8-2 under Sir Alex Ferguson, but on this occasion their efforts failed to see them score once.",
      "Mikel Arteta, seeking to end a run of three straight second place finishes, praised his team's ability to dig in and claim a vital early three points. He said: \"The team has to find that resilience throughout the season for ten months in different contexts to be able to do that. Of course, we have to improve a lot of things and that will happen very soon.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has spoken out after featuring in Brighton's opening game of the season, despite strong interest in his services from Manchester United. The Red Devils have spent big so far this summer, forking out more than £200million on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Ruben Amorim is hopeful the trio will provide United with more cutting edge in the final third and he is also keen to strengthen his midfield, with Baleba emerging as their top target earlier this summer.",
      "They entered talks with Brighton earlier this month, but United are unwilling to pay the £120m that the Seagulls are demanding. However, reports have claimed that Baleba is keen on a move to Old Trafford and prepared to keep pushing for it even if that means waiting until next summer.",
      "Despite the ongoing speculation about his future, Baleba did start for Brighton as they drew 1-1 with Fulham in their Premier League opener on Saturday. And the 21-year-old took to social media after the game, posting a series of snaps with the caption: \"Just me doing the thing I love most.",
      "\"Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba's caption appears to be a reference to comments made by Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler ahead of the game when he was quizzed on the midfielder's future. When asked if he believes Baleba will remain at Brighton, Hurzeler replied: \"I am very, very confident.",
      "\"I didn't see any change, he's only changed his hair. I think that's the change he's made in the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow\".",
      "Amorim also addressed the rumours ahead of United's opener against Arsenal. When asked if he wants to bring in a new midfielder this summer, he replied: \"I'm really happy with our players.",
      "\"They are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that I think can play in that position if we want something different.",
      "\"But then we are going to find out [during] the season. We have players to cope to win games in the Premier League.\"",

      "The United boss was encouraged with his side's performance, as the Old Trafford crowd applauded them off at full-time. Fans were off their feet watching new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo while Benjamin Sesko made his debut in the second half.",

      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has warned Rasmus Hojlund that he'll remain on the sidelines if he doesn't 'do what's required'. Hojlund, 22, watched from the stands against Arsenal, with Benjamin Sesko quickly usurping him in the pecking order.",
      "\"At United, if you don't do what's required, a team-mate will take your place,\" Amorim said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes, but I've shown that if you deserve it, you play.\"",
      "The Red Devils manager added: \"He has to fight for his place. We will see what's going to happen in the market. Rasmus has the same characteristics as Ben, so sometimes we need to chose.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has broken his silence amid links of a move to Manchester United. Baleba, 21, started Brighton's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday, just over a week after the Red Devils made contact with Brighton to register their interest in the Cameroonian midfielder, who's been given a new shirt number this season.",

      "David Moyes hopes he can rekindle the magic from Jack Grealish and cites Jesse Lingard as an example of how he has proven he can do it. Everton kick-off their campaign on Monday at Leeds with loan signing Grealish in contention for his debut.",
      "The Manchester City and England midfielder has fallen out of favour with boss Pep Guardiola and played only 715 Premier League minutes last season. But now he’s joined Everton looking to get back to his best with the World Cup coming next summer. Moyes is hoping he can do what he did with Lingard, when he signed him on loan from Manchester United at West Ham in 2021 which saw the player find form and earn an England recall.",
      "The Everton boss said: “I think we are all saying there is a Jack Grealish who played for Aston Villa, there’s one who played for Manchester City, one we’ve seen playing for England and along the line there he is playing for arguably the best manager in the world. So I take his thoughts as well but I have to find ways of getting the best out of players as well.",
      "“Jesse Lingard is an example. If we can get him to be as successful as that this year it would be great. Without putting all the pressure on Jack, and I think he carries a lot of pressure anyway because of who he is and what he is, I think he’s got a wee bit where he has to prove one or two people (wrong) as well. I’m looking forward to seeing how he does.”",
      "Moyes did not speak to Guardiola before completing the move for Grealish but has been confident he would join this summer for a while. The Scot said: “I didn’t speak directly to Pep about it, although he has him closely and is one of the best managers and chooses what he wants.",
      "“My choice is that I think he can bring us something which we’ve not got, a bit more flair and hopefully more creativity to our attacking line. What convinced me is the knowledge that he thinks he’s got a little bit to prove and to stand up. I’ve had to do that myself personally. I’ve had to come back from being knocked down. Sometimes you have to have that resilience to bounce back, to fight back and to show everybody.",
      "“I just sense that Jack is carrying that with him now. I hope it shows through this season because, if it does, then we’ll get a lot of good things from Jack if he does.”",
      "Moyes is trying to rebuild Everton’s squad after a mass exodus of first-team players at the end of last season. He’s brought in Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Thierno Barry, Adam Aznou, Mark Travers and Carlos Alcaraz has made his loan permanent.",
      "Moyes added: “I think the club have done brilliantly to build a new stadium. It has taken years to happen but they’ve got there eventually and done it. I think now there has to be a building of a football club back inside it, to get it back to where it was and more importantly to get the team back to where it was. Or closer to where it should be.",
      "“We are a long way off at the moment. I don’t think we can do that in this window and make the team what we want it to be, but we are going to need people along the journey to make it more exciting and make people want to come and play.",
      "“Whether that is through high-profile players or our league position or how we are playing and our performances, we are needing some of them to give us a lift now. There’s been quite a few players who I’ve been disappointed have not chosen to come to Everton this summer and I think that’s because, if you look at the last four or five years, we’ve not been in great shape.",
      "“Hopefully they are beginning to see a new stadium, great results in the second half of last season, and they start to believe Everton is a good home for them.”",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane questioned Arsenal's willingness to sit on a 1-0 lead despite the London side winning at Old Trafford. One goal was enough for the Gunners this time, with Riccardo Calafiori securing victory, but that might not always be the case.",
      "Last season, dropped points from winning positions cost Mikel Arteta's side dear. They led in seven of their last eight matches but won only three, throwing away leads against Everton, Brentford, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth.",
      "\"You compare that to Man City and Liverpool. They are always looking to go on and get the second or the third. Even on a bad day they can score two or three goals.\"",
      "Liverpool and City each scored four on the opening weekend of the season, though the reigning champions were pegged back from 2-0 to 2-2 before beating Bournemouth. The draws stat alluded to by Keane relates to the 14 Arsenal chalked up in the league, as they finished 10 points behind Liverpool despite losing the same number of matches.",
      "Keane's fellow pundit Micah Richards was impressed by Arsenal's resolve at the back. However, he also appeared to indicate a more ambitious attacking mindset might reduce the need for that kind of defending.",
      "“It's how much you can dig deep,\" Richards said. \"What has helped Arsenal stay in title races in recent years is that when they get into that low block, they are very difficult to break down. Then you add in the set-pieces and they are a good team. I would just like to see them be a little more brave.”",
      "Arsenal boss Arteta was under no illusions about the quality of his team's display but was happy with the result. \"We came here away and won which is a big result,\" the Spaniard said.",
      "\"We were clearly not at our best. We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",

      "Football loving writer who spends much of his life on motorways getting to games all over the country. Passionate about football, my job and the Mirror. The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "It was hardly a classic but the away end celebrated to a familiar song.",
      "“1-0 to the Arsenal” rang round Old Trafford after the final whistle as the Gunners ended up sitting pretty by winning ugly for a change. Scrappy does not do it justice and the result was more about familiar failings rather than any of the new big-money signings for either side.",
      "Ultimately, it was decided by a tale of two keepers as Arsenal’s David Raya was man-of-the-match while Manchester United’s Altay Bayındır had a stinker on Riccardo Calafiori’s winner. United have spent £200m on a new front three and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were excellent while Benjamin Sesko had a decent cameo as a late substitute. But unless they sign a keeper, all of their good work elsewhere will be undermined.",
      "Last season’s No.1 Andre Onana is being frozen out, Bayındır is hopeless on crosses and they desperately need to plug the gap otherwise they will not push on. Arsenal’s own big money striker, £64m hitman Viktor Gyokeres, looked heavy, ineffective and the visitors looked way better when Kai Havertz came on. Martin Zubimendi impressed throughout.",
      "But Arsenal, for all their own big-money spending, have not solved the left sided problem as Gabriel Martinelli ran down blind alleys and Noni Madueke barely got a look-in when he came on. Arsenal certainly did not look as sharp or ready as either of their title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City, although you could argue that winning at Old Trafford is still the most eye-catching result of the weekend.",
      "Beating this United side is hardly the statement result it once was but holding on for a gritty, defiant and determined win is still probably a message of intent for the rest of the season. Whether Arsenal have enough to dig in and scrap for enough of these wins remains to be seen. But they showed real character on a day when too few of their players were at their best.",
      "It is hard to read too much into the opening day and, if anything, United should be most encouraged by Mbeumo’s threat and Cunha’s brilliance. But United ended up with Harry Maguire coming on for his aerial threat at set pieces. There were some late scares, last ditch clearances and yet Arsenal held on.",
      "Arsenal are the team which still boss free kicks and corners. That is how Arsenal won the game and the away end unashamedly sang: “Set piece again, ole, ole.” Declan Rice’s corner was whipped in and, for all the warnings about pushing and shoving in pre-season, there was plenty in the United box.",
      "Bayındır's lame attempt at a punch did not work and there was Riccardo Calafiori to head home after just 13 minutes. What a start. But Arsenal did not settle and, if anything, United took charge and provided the bigger threat. Patrick Dorgu’s low shot hit the post. Cunha’s brilliant low cross shot forced a sensational save from Raya.",
      "Mbeumo’s header forced another great save from Raya who, despite his size, looked like a giant as he punched and caught every high ball into the box. Arsenal went through their repertoire of substitutes and their bench now looks very strong but whether the depth will plug the gap for the missing quality and X Factor - particularly down the left - which they need to win the title.",
      "As for United, they do look better than last season. Mbeumo and Cunha are exciting signings and, when fully fit, Sesko will be a handful. But they have to find a solution to their keeper problem. And it is no wonder why United are still in the market for a midfielder because they have holes in the starting line-up.",
      "However, United do look better and there are signs despite the frustration. Arsenal got their reward from a high risk, high reward opening fixture. No wonder Mikel Arteta looked so happy afterwards.",

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

      "Bayindir feebly attempted to punch away Declan Rice's inswinging corner, which ricocheted towards goal and was nodded in by Riccardo Calafiori for the only goal at Old Trafford on 13 minutes.",
      "Bayindir conceded a similar winner at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-final last season when he was beaten directly from Son Heung-min's corner.",
      "Amorim opted not to start Andre Onana against Arsenal as United's first-choice 'keeper had been involved in only three team training sessions since he recovered from a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in pre-season.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",
      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",
      "Amorim was coy on Rasmus Hojlund's future after he was omitted from the matchday squad. United are looking to sell Hojlund two years on from buying him from Atalanta in a £72million deal.",
      "\"He’s [got] to fight for the place,\" Amorim explained. \"We are going to see what happens in the market. [He has] different characteristics and Rasmus has the same characteristics as Benjamin Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 in their opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hoping to start the new campaign with a positive result, but Arsenal opened the scoring at Old Trafford in the 13th minute after a mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "Bayindir failed to properly connect with the corner and Riccardo Calafiori was gifted an easy header at the back post. United responded well and created enough chances to equalise, but a breakthrough proved elusive.",
      "Here are the talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed:",
      "Arsenal analysts were not happy",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "Gabriel Martinelli overhit a simple pass to Martin Odegaard on the counter-attack, much to the relief of Amorim on the sidelines, but the Arsenal analyst did not hide his frustration at the move breaking down.",
      "The pair also looked unhappy when Arsenal were dispossessed near the end of the first half. United created enough chances to be level by the interval and Arsenal were only leading due to Bayindir's shocking error.",
      "The frustration proves Arsenal were not good enough on Sunday afternoon, and they were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Same old story",
      "There was a melee in the box with just a few minutes to play. United were desperately trying to score an equaliser and committed bodies forward, but it just wouldn't go in for them.",
      "Benjamin Sesko turned his effort over the bar, high into the Stretford End, and Amorim responded on the touchline by placing his hands on his head. United have spent close to £200million on their attack this summer, but the same problem existed against Arsenal: they couldn't score.",
      "Having said that, United were the better side. There were signs of progress and positives to take, despite an opening day defeat.",
      "Cunha the crowd favourite",
      "Matheus Cunha made an immediate impact in the dressing room after his arrival from Wolves. The Brazilian is a huge personality and is a stereotypical fiery South American, so it always seemed likely he would become a fan favourite.",
      "And Cunha took the first steps to earning fan favourite status against Arsenal. He looked dangerous and roared at the crowd just before the hour mark after a scrappy physical battle with William Saliba.",
      "The 26-year-old won the ball near the tunnel by the Stetford End corner, fighting aggressively against Saliba. He reacted by vigorously first pumping to the crowd, who lapped it up. Cunha plays on the edge and he helped to whip up the crowd as United pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Cunha has the quality to back up his behaviour. He delivered an impressive performance on his competitive Old Trafford debut and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.",
      "What did Amorim expect?",
      "Amorim decided to play without a recognised striker against Arsenal. Sesko was ready to start the game, but he was named on the bench and Amorim's front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Cunha was fluid.",
      "Those three players took turns to play down the middle and regularly rotated positions, but the downside of that selection was seen in the first half when Diogo Dalot pulled a ball back into the box and nobody was there.",
      "Amorim was spotted shouting at Mount, who was positioned outside the box, but what did United's head coach expect? He shouldn't have been surprised to see Mount fail to think like a striker.",
      "Sesko was eventually introduced to the game in the 65th minute. The Slovenia international struggled to get into the contest, but it might have been a different story if he'd been included in the starting team.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Avram Glazer was spotted in the directors' box. The 64-year-old last made an appearance at Old Trafford for the opening game of last season against Fulham and showed his face again for the visit of Arsenal.",
      "The 1958 had planned to stage a protest against the club's ownership before facing Arsenal, but they decided to postpone the demonstration after surveying fans about whether it should go ahead.",
      "Whether that had something to do with Avram Glazer attending the game is up for debate. The American co-owner has deliberately made limited appearances in Manchester over the last few years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was among those seated n the directors' box. The striker was dropped from the squad and is being ruthlessly shown the door by Amorim after taking huge backwards steps last season.",
      "JJ Gabriel was also seen in the directors' box against Arsenal. The youngster is just 14 years old, but there is a buzz at United about his potential and the invite to watch the game shows how highly he is regarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro",
      "Arsenal could have steamrollered Casemiro but they let him off. The Brazilian still merely existed in an area that Declan Rice bossed. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Scored United's goals against Arsenal last term but started badly and did not improve enough. Too rash with and without the ball. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struck the post after a positive charge towards the Arsenal area at 0-1 but struggled to maintain that level of threat in the second half. Rightly booked. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Played one memorable pass but that was about it from a player whose best work is almost always off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with him. 5",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Continued his promising pre-season form and had the measure of Calafiori. Had shots at goal but none threatening enough. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Made a good fist of the centre forward role. Had chances, drew a terrific save from Raya and worked tirelessly all afternoon. 7",
      "Subs",
      "Amad",
      "Injected energy into the attacks from wide right. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Had little of the ball. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Upped the tempo in midfield. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Immediately conceded a foul. 5",
      "Manager",
      "Picked a team teeming with contentious calls and one of them - the goalkeeper - cost United. Absence of an out-and-out striker was felt as Mount flopped again. 5",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, August 18th 2025.",
      "United’s Premier League season got up and running with a narrow defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started the match while Benjamin Sesko’s debut came as a second-half substitute, but Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal took all three points back to London.",
      "United continue to look for new faces to add to Ruben Amorim’s squad, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by the head coach thought to be on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton comes after it was reported that a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, with United relaxed about the situation and happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "There is also the small matter of sales to discuss with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes Arsenal's goal against Man United should not have stood and that the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL) 'failed' to come to the correct verdict over the incident.",
      "United began their season with a 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, with Riccardo Calafiori scoring the only goal of the match. Despite the loss, United put on a productive display for the home crowd and created several goalscoring opportunities. The improvement was clear, but Clattenburg believes the scoreline could have been different. For Arsenal’s goal, William Saliba seemed to wrestle with Mason Mount, preventing Altay Bayindir from properly punching away the cross.",
      "\"In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal’s goal, but when you watch it in slow motion you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball,\" the former referee said. \"PGMOL said they would punish more this type of challenge, but again they failed.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Besiktas are yet to re-enter contact with Man United following an initial approach.",
      "\"Besiktas called two weeks ago to ask for deal conditions… but since then, no fresh contacts took place,\" he wrote on X.",
      "\"Besiktas remain willing to match Man United asking price but Sancho is not accepting a move to Turkey now. It can be an option only later on - with Turkish market closing on September 12.\"",
      "Betfair - Rasmus Hojlund to sign for before 2nd September 2025",
      "AC Milan 2/9",
      "RB Leipzig 5/1",
      "Atalanta 13/2",
      "Newcastle 8/1",
      "*BetFair odds correct at the time of writing.",
      "Neville believes Man United need to address a 'glaring' issue before the window slams shut on September 1.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes. I don't know where they are on PSR [the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules], but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan. The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters. You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina. They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.\"",
      "Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club's interest in Hojlund this summer.",
      "\"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" he said. \"We’re evaluating him in the coming days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.",
      "\"We know we have to intervene in that position, and we also know they have to be players who can bring something extra to this group.\"",
      "However, Gazzetta dello Sport report that the Serie A side wouldn’t want to offer more than €34–35m (£29–30m), while United are reportedly asking for a package of €45m (£39m), including the loan fee and purchase option.",
      "Manchester United could still sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"The situation involving Emi Martinez has gone completely quiet. But a goalkeeper they still like and are still keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"Very talented goalkeeper, Belgian and United have been monitoring him for a long time. I told you about this interest in July and the beginning of August. This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\"",
      "As expected, Garnacho was nowhere to be seen at Old Trafford for Sunday's game amid ongoing uncertainty over his squad. Despite his threat, there doesn't seem to be dissatisfaction within the fanbase over his exclusion.",
      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",
      "The Argentina international is keen to move to Chelsea this summer.",
      "Man United are reportedly considering involving Hojlund in a swap deal with AC Milan, as they pursue the Italian club's goalkeeper, Mike Maignan.",
      "The French international was linked with a move to Chelsea ahead of the Club World Cup but ultimately stayed in Milan.",
      "The Express believe that Fulham are in the mix and could provide the forward with a chance to stay in the Premier League.",
      "The possibility of including Joshua King in the deal is also rumored.",
      "Man United have previously been linked with an interest in RB Leipzig attacker Simons, who has impressed for both club and country in recent seasons.",
      "However, the 13-time Premier League champions would need to outmaneuver Chelsea’s pursuit of the 22-year-old, as Simons is reportedly leaning towards a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and were hopeful of starting the new campaign with a victory, but Arsenal left Manchester with a 1-0 victory after a Riccardo Calafiori goal.",
      "However, Fernandes was hesitant to say the result was unfair. \"I wouldn't say unfair, but I obviously think we came up a little bit short today,\" he said during a post-match interview with MUTV. \"Overall, we did something else to deserve a different result. It's very difficult to see the positive things when you lose the game, but we need to look forward and see next week what we can improve after this game. We will look at what we didn't do so good and what went wrong.\"",
      "When asked about the support from United fans throughout the game, Fernandes added: \"It was brilliant. Like I just said in a previous interview, they talk about hope in the team for what we did and everything.",
      "\"When I finished the game, what gave me hope for the season being very good for us and positive was the way the fans reacted. When we came around and came into the tunnel, they gave us hope with that. The next game is very important for us to give something back.\"",
      "The Sun claims that David De Gea is one of the goalkepers under consideration by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report states that the Spaniard has a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to return to the club at a reduced fee. United have just two weeks to strengthen their goalkeeping department this season, with Onana facing heavy scrutiny for his performances both last season and over the summer.",
      "He was left out of Amorim's squad for their Premier League clash with Arsenal. After the game, the Portuguese boss said: \"He's not injured, he's recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.\"",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has also been linked with a move to Manchester as he is expected to leave the French champions.",
      "Man United are far from sanctioning an exit for Sancho amid interest from AS Roma, claims TEAMtalk.",
      "United have reportedly verbally accepted a £20million offer from Roma for the winger, but reaching an agreement with the player is expected to be challenging. TEAMtalk understands that the main obstacle is Sancho’s wage demands.",
      "He currently earns £250,000 a week at United, with a contract running until next summer.",
      "Roma coach Gian Piero Gasperini is personally trying to persuade Sancho, but the player has reportedly shown no willingness to lower his salary for the move.",
      "Man United are reportedly trying to sanction a sale for Rasmus Hojlund before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Rasmus Hojlund [was] out of the squad and we know that Manchester United are trying to find a solution for him. They want Hojlund to go.",
      "\"They want to sell Hojlund as soon as possible. If a sale is not going to be possible, they want to do a loan with an option to buy – €6m loan fee, an option to buy around €40-45.",
      "\"So negotiations will now follow for Hojlund, with interest from AC Milan and more clubs around Europe, not only Milan.\"",
      "If Man United maintain their interest, they may face a lengthy queue of suitors ready to make an offer next year.",
      "According to The Athletic, Brighton acknowledge that, given the timing and the likelihood of a bidding war, this would be the ideal moment to sell.",
      "Hurzeler, who was asked about what he is looking for from Baleba this season, told reporters: \"Making the next step - getting more mature in decision-making, getting more mature regarding game management, being more consistent in the performances that we expect from him.\"",
      "If he hits those targets, Baleba is set to become one of the standout transfer stories of the summer 2026 window.",
      "Besides interest in Jadon Sancho, AS Roma have reportedly also made contact for Malacia.",
      "Taking to X to provide an update, Fabrizio Romano wrote: \"During talks with Man United for Sancho (no green light yet from Jadon), Roma also ask for Malacia deal conditions.",
      "\"Tyrell, keen on the move; Besiktas also interested in the Dutch left back.\"",
      "AC Milanare reportedly keen to strike a €35m (£30.2m) deal for Hojlund.",
      "The striker, who was left out of Ruben Amorim's squad on Sunday, is expected to leave the club if the right offer arrives.",
      "Milan are one of the interested sides, although they are also said to be considering Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic as an alternative.",
      "The Athletic journalist David Ornstein has quashed any chance of United pulling off a move for Wharton this summer.",
      "\"They've been linked to the likes of [Martin] Hjulmand at Sporting Lisbon and Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace,\" he told NBC Sports on Sunday. \"I'm not sure those are likely to come to fruition at this moment in time; they want to get players out of here.\"",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Man United are among three Premier League clubs showing interest in Brentford centre-back Nathan Collins.",
      "Reports suggest that interest in the Irish defender is 'surging,' though Brentford are expected to resist any attempts to lure him away. For United, however, any new signings are likely to depend on player departures from the current squad.",
      "New manager, and fellow Irishman, Keith Andrews praised the former Wolves defender, calling him 'a natural leader.'",
      "And welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, 18th August.",

      "PGMOL is the body responsible for refereeing games in English professional association football and employs the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) to assist the on-field referee with major match decisions including goals, penalties, direct red cards, and mistaken identity.",
      "This month, PGMOL chief Howard Webb revealed that referees will award more penalties for holding in this season. \"We have to identify those situations that do fall in line with the feedback that we had, that there are just a few too many examples of players clearly pulling people back, impacting their ability to move to the ball or some clear extreme actions are not being penalised,\" said Webb.",
      "\"They're the ones I expect us to catch. Therefore, I would expect this time next year to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we've seen this year. But not a huge swing of the pendulum because that's really difficult to sustain over a period of time.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher reckons Manchester United were right not to be awarded a penalty in their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Matheus Cunha went down inside the penalty area after a collision with William Saliba in the latter stages of the club's Premier League opener. After latching on to Matthijs de Ligt's pass inside the area, the summer signing was unable to connect properly with the ball.",
      "Saliba seemed to make contact with Cunha's left foot, but referee Simon Hooper did not penalise the defender. Replays show that Saliba did touch Cunha with frustrations growing that the foul wasn't spotted.",
      "Bothroyd then asked why, referring to the possibility of a foul being given in another position on the field. \"How's that not a penalty? That's a guaranteed penalty.",
      "\"If that happens on the half-way line, that's a free-kick. Is it a free-kick on the halfway line?\"",
      "Gallagher replied: \"It wasn't on the halfway line. I don't play that game.\"",
      "\"Why not?\" Bothroyd asked. \"A free-kick on the halfway line should be the same as in the box.\"",
      "Gallagher then replied: \"I agree on that. No, not a foul.\"",
      "\"That's definitely a foul. He's come through the back of him,\" Bothroyd added.",
      "\"The ball was there, he came through the back of him and hit that foot that he planted. It's a penalty.\"",
      "Despite Bothroyd's persistence, Gallagher concluded the debate by saying: \"You judge what happens and at that point, I don't think it's a foul. I wouldn't give a foul [anywhere else on the pitch].\"",

      "Manchester United showed signs of promise in their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League with summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo impressing.",
      "Both players started the game at Old Trafford and were unfortunate not to score on their debuts. Benjamin Sesko also made his debut, coming off the bench following his move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Despite the spirited display, which saw Ruben Amorim's men be the better team on the day, the Reds came away from the game with nothing. The defeat did, however, provide food for thought on what United must do in the final two weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The most obvious area for improvement is in goal. Andre Onana wasn't in the squad on Sunday and Amorim's comments suggest it was his decision rather than one forced on him through injury.",
      "\"I didn't drop Onana from the squad, I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad,\" Amorim stated. \"It is not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without time training.\"",
      "His replacement, Altay Bayindir, didn't cover himself in glory against Arsenal. The Turkey international was blamed for Riccardo Calafiori's winner after failing to deal with Declan Rice's corner.",
      "Bayindir's performance has led to calls for United to bring in a new goalkeeper before the window shuts. Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, as well as Manchester City, with Diogo Costa and Senne Lammens also on their radar.",
      "Amorim did confirm he is happy with his selection of goalkeepers so it seems unlikely the club will see a new arrival in goal, though. Another position that could be strengthened is midfield, more specifically ball-winner to partner Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Casemiro was given the nod by Amorim from the start with Manuel Ugarte replacing him in the second-half. Kobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute and despite the options, United have been in the market for a new midfielder.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba appears to have stalled with the club now prepared to delay a move until next year. There have been a number of other midfielders previously linked with United, however, with Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton reportedly on their radar and names such as Felix Nmecha and Morten Hjulmand also linked over the course of the summer transfer window.",
      "In terms of outgoings, United have plenty of work to do. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Tyrell Malacia were all left out of the squad on Sunday.",
      "Hojlund had featured in pre-season, unlike the other three, but was excluded by Amorim. The striker was at Old Trafford but is likely to depart the club with AC Milan showing a keenness.",
      "Sancho has been linked with a move to AS Roma while it's believed that Chelsea are exploring a move for Garnacho. Malacia is reportedly wanted by Roma and Atalanta.",

      "Manchester United fans have given Bruno Fernandes 'hope' for the 2025/26 season.",
      "United enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and were hopeful of starting the new campaign with a victory, but Arsenal left Manchester with a 1-0 victory after a Riccardo Calafiori goal.",
      "A mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner in the 13th minute gifted Calafiori a simple finish. United responded well and created chances as they searched for an equaliser, but they couldn't find a breakthrough.",
      "However, Fernandes was hesitant to say the result was unfair. \"I wouldn't say unfair, but I obviously think we came up a little bit short today,\" he said during a post-match interview with MUTV.",
      "\"Overall, we did something else to deserve a different result. It's very difficult to see the positive things when you lose the game, but we need to look forward and see next week what we can improve after this game. We will look at what we didn't do so good and what went wrong.",
      "\"But I think it's always good things to see from this game to take forward and try to replicate that, but obviously trying to get goals and win the game.\"",
      "When asked about the support from United fans throughout the game, Fernandes responded: \"It was brilliant. Like I just said in a previous interview, they talk about hope in the team for what we did and everything.",
      "\"When I finished the game, what gave me hope for the season being very good for us and positive was the way the fans reacted.",
      "\"When we came around and came into the tunnel, they gave us hope with that. The next game is very important for us to give something back.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim led the players around Old Trafford following the final whistle. The players showed their appreciation to the fans, who applauded them for their effort.",
      "Fernandes also discussed the performances of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. \"They did very well. We know what they can give to the game and we know the qualities they have,\" he said.",
      "\"They are a very big threat on the ball and it's the beginnings still, but they will do more and create more for us, I'm sure, because their quality is very, very high.\"",

      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United must sign a new goalkeeper this summer.",
      "Andre Onana has been recovering from a hamstring injury and was omitted from the squad to face Arsenal on Sunday, which meant Altay Bayindir was chosen to start in goal.",
      "Arsenal took the lead in the 13th minute of the game through Riccardo Calafiori. Bayindir was at fault, failing to connect properly with the corner, and Calafiori was gifted a simple finish at the back post.",
      "Bayindir was also unconvincing last season, making mistakes against Tottenham and Newcastle, while Onana made a number of high-profile errors, including mistakes in games against Viktoria Plzen, Nottingham Forest and Lyon.",
      "\"What it does point toward [Arsenal's goal] is Arsenal's great set-piece play, but it also points toward a glaring issue for United that cannot be ignored. They do need to find a goalkeeper. They have to.",
      "“I'm absolutely unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man United for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No.1 who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR [Profit and Sustainability Rules], but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.”",
      "Neville continued: \"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma. The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man United is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "“You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.”",
      "United have spent close to £200million to overhaul their attack in a single window. Amorim would also like to strengthen his midfield options before the transfer deadline on September 1.",
      "In a tense post-Arsenal press conference, Amorim insisted he is happy with his goalkeepers. \"He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and will let the ball pass.\"",

      "A home defeat without scoring is familiar fare from Manchester United. Their productive performance was unfamiliar.",
      "United were the more enterprising and energetic team, fuelled by the optimistic atmosphere that was enhanced by pre-match adjustments. United fashioned more goalscoring chances in one afternoon against Arsenal than they did in one month last season.",
      "Yet the bottom line is they lost their opening fixture for the eighth time in the Premier League era. United have been beaten 16 times at home in the league since the start of the 2023-24 campaign. Ruben Amorim was not on his haunches as much but his hands were often planted on his crown.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt dropped to the turf at full-time. United players and staff still embarked on a lap of honour. Purists would rather see them head straight down the tunnel for a raw debrief.",
      "Hope is at least back again at United, in spite of another home reverse. The six added minutes elicited an excitable cheer. There was no air of resignation as there was throughout the defeatist performances of last season.",
      "But no striker and no goals. Benjamin Sesko crossed the white line to the sound of an expectant roar in the 65th minute. His inactive cameo partly legislated for why Amorim did not start him.",
      "Few teams are better equipped to defend a lead than Arsenal, a throwback to George Graham's artisans. United were undone by another Arsenal set piece.",
      "This was an archetypal 1-0-to-the-Ar-se-nal. They were second best for the majority of the afternoon and their supporters were constantly irked by the referee, Simon Hooper. They still shielded their goal for 77 minutes whilst leading.",
      "United, having invested almost £74million in a new number nine, played without one. Amorim has refused to accommodate Rasmus Hojlund after he aired his intention to stay and the strikerless experiments against Everton in Atlanta and Fiorentina in Manchester signposted a similar set-up against Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund is so unwanted he was omitted from the matchday squad with Joshua Zirkzee available again. Hojlund, loitering in the tunnel pre-match, watched the first half from the directors' box but was not visible in the second half.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made up the front three in United's final friendly against Fiorentina. The only goal United managed was an own goal. They lined up together again and this time there was no goal.",
      "Amorim's team was littered with contentious calls and the 'keeper was the costliest. Altay Bayindir was fortunate to play for United again after he conceded a winner direct from a corner at Tottenham in December and it practically happened again against the other north London club.",
      "Bayindir is not better than Tom Heaton, in his 40th year, never mind Andre Onana. United's first choice will reclaim his role at Fulham this week.",
      "Onana himself was cornered by Arsenal in their victory at the Emirates last season. The sight of Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes, stood forlornly in the technical area was as familiar as United trailing at half-time without scoring.",
      "It was in the 27th minute that the absence of Amad and a striker was visible. Mbeumo delayed his pass too long for the overlapping and offside Diogo Dalot, who crossed to an invisible centre forward, much to the supporters' chagrin. The broadcasters zoomed in on a watchful Sesko. Amad was the first game-changer sent on by Amorim.",
      "Sesko remained in the dugout when the first batch of substitutes headed out to warm up a minute into the second half. Zirkzee was among those to limber up. Amad was soon summoned and his sprints along the touchline were more urgent. Sesko joined them five minutes later.",
      "Amad and Bruno Fernandes were the only two players who started in all five of United's pre-season friendlies. To bench Amad was pragmatic, bordering on the negative. United were lifted by his zig-zag bursts into the Arsenal area.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Sesko could have easily joined their opponents. The Stretford End heckled Gyokeres with a rendition of \"You fat b*****d\". It would be diplomatic to describe him as heavy. So heavy that Casemiro caught up with Gyokeres in the United third after losing the ball inside the Arsenal half. The hostility from the United fans continued up to Gyokeres' withdrawal on the hour.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo gave a glimpse of how productive United's new front three could be. They were responsible for the four on-target attempts from United in the first half. Patrick Dorgu pinged the post. Mbeumo had the measure of the rash Riccardo Calafiori, booked in the 42nd minute for a tactical foul. Calafiori was still the only one to get on the scoresheet.",
      "Mount continues to produce his finest work off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with Mount, misguidedly promoted to the Europa League final starting XI at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. Mount and Casemiro were both hooked simultaneously.",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "Hearty applause followed United's near-misses, such was their encouraging play. Eight minutes in, Declan Rice turned to the Arsenal back four and attempted to gee them up. William Saliba's foul on Dorgu was as much to rouse himself and his teammates.",
      "Mikel Arteta almost encroached onto the pitch to berate the wasteful Gabriel Martinelli after a breakaway broke down. One of the Arsenal analysts reacted by smacking the wall of the press box.",
      "Amorim urged United to commence attacks through Luke Shaw. Sometimes United bided their time, waiting for room to free up either side of De Ligt, the meat in the back-three sandwich.",
      "It was another middle centre back Amorim turned to up the other end. Harry Maguire practically played up front in a team that has negotiated a fee upwards of £180m on three strikers. All three were present at the stadium as United fired blanks.",
      "That was familiar.",

      "United pressed impressively, looked more creative and did not let their heads drop after Altay Bayindir's inexplicable goalkeeping error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to put the Gunners ahead. And yet a costly mistake from their keeper has cost Amorim's team once more in a game where they deserved much more.",
      "The Reds have struggled badly to replace David de Gea in goal since his departure and even the Spanaird was not the force he once was when he left in July 2023.",
      "Andre Onana was brought in to improve United's ability to play out from the back. His arrival from Inter Milan was heralded as one to help then-Reds boss Erik ten Hag implement a more dynamic style of play.",
      "But his time at United has been littered with errors and the Cameroon international has been linked with a move away this summer.",
      "Many called for his understudy, Bayindir, to be given more of a chance after his impressive display against Arsenal in the FA Cup last season. The Turkish shot-stopper was easily United's man of the match that day in January.",
      "However, the 27-year-old has failed to live up on that performance in north London. Any hope that such form could be replicated against the same opponent on Sunday were then dashed less than 15 minutes in when he flapped at a ball which led to the Gunners going 1-0 up.",
      "Now, Amorim and United are in a difficult position. Having spent over £200million on attacking talents - funds are now short to strengthen further this summer. Focus will instead be on sales with Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia all potential exits before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "It appears likely that United will have to rely on Onana, Bayindir and a 39-year-old Tom Heaton until at least January. Such a scenario may send shivers down the spines of United fans after Sunday's match.",
      "It's a reminder that despite all the positivity over the club's summer transfer business, there is still much to do. Those problems were never going to be solved in one window, but the reality has just become that little bit clearer for Amorim in a crucial campaign.",

      "United signed Onana from Inter Milan for £47.2million in July 2023 but he has endured two error-strewn seasons. The 29-year-old was withdrawn from the squad at Newcastle United in April after he made two mistakes in the Europa League quarter-final first leg draw with Lyon.",
      "Bayindir has seldom convinced across his ten starts for United but he did help them beat Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season, saving penalties in regulation time and the shootout.",

      "Gary Neville was rendered speechless when Ian Wright highlighted a concerning scenario regarding Manchester United signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international joined from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million with additional fees totalling approximately £7.6m. Sesko is an exciting prospect, but his youthful inexperience and United's poor return of scoring 44 Premier League goals last term means doubts are persisting over his potential impact.",
      "Rather than concentrating purely on Sesko, Neville also discussed fellow summer arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, setting the trio a collective target of 35 goals. Wright challenged this observation, noting how earlier in their discussion, Neville had suggested Viktor Gyokeres' inaugural Arsenal campaign would prove disappointing should he net merely 10 Premier League goals.",
      "During the latest Stick to Football podcast, Neville initiated the debate by saying: \"Sesko, we know less about him. Obviously, we've seen bits about him.",
      "\"We've seen centre-forwards come to United over the last six, seven or eight seasons and it's not been easy. There is going to be pressure on him, obviously [Rasmus] Hojlund is still there.\"",
      "Wright subsequently responded: \"The thing as well with him is that he scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season. [Omar] Marmoush left in December and had 15.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That says to me as a striker he should be scoring more at that level. I think like Gyokeres, he has got such great ability and physicality, I think he will get 15 goals.\"",
      "Neville subsequently claimed a haul of between \"10 or 13\" goals would represent success for Sesko, assuming Mbeumo and Cunha contribute the remaining 25 goals between them.",
      "Yet Wright challenged the former United skipper's assessment, drawing comparisons with the significantly higher expectations he'd established for Gyokeres. The Arsenal legend said: \"What if Sesko only scored 10?",
      "\"Seriously, what if he only got 10. You just turned your nose up when I mentioned Gyokeres potentially only getting 10 and now you're thinking about Sesko only getting 10.\"",
      "Despite Neville highlighting Gyokeres is more experienced than Sesko, Wright wouldn't allow him to escape scrutiny. The former England defender then attempted to construct an argument by saying: \"I think 10...\" before finding himself rendered speechless by his own contemplations.",
      "Whilst Wright turned towards Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott and Roy Keane, Neville said: \"The reason I am stuttering is because I'm wondering how Cunha and Mbeumo are going to do. If he scores 10 and the others can chip in with 12 a piece, I would still say 35 from the three of them is massive.\"",
      "When Wright pressed him further regarding his suggestion 10 goals for Gyokeres would fall well short, Neville replied: \"The reason I said that is because I think Arsenal will create so many more chances. They will have so much more play.",
      "\"They are a much better team. He (Gyokeres) is going to be in a better team. He's going to get more chances. Sesko is not going to get as many chances as Gyokeres. That is where I would be at with it.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's first starting XI will be announced before kick-off against the Gunners at Old Trafford and the name supporters are hopeful of seeing is Sesko's. The 22-year-old striker completed a transfer from RB Leipzig last weekend and Sunday will be his first opportunity to play.",
      "He followed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha through the entrance as United have reshaped their attack force for a total £207.5m over the summer.",
      "Now the challenge will be score more than the 44 goals United's players collectively managed in the Premier League last season.",
      "\"The biggest problem they had all last season despite chatting about the goalkeeper, the defence, they didn’t score enough goals. When you’re not scoring enough goals, particularly when Manchester United invested so much money, you’re constantly under so much pressure.\"",
      "The United legend-turned-pundit began to have his say on the club's summer business, suggesting he is largely impressed with what he has seen. He added: \"Obviously tried to fix that this summer and the new signings, looking at them in pre-season I know it’s still early but yeah, the signs are good.",
      "\"They’ve obviously brought two players in who know the Premiership, they’re robust enough to deal with the challenge. Obviously they needed a goalscorer, they were constantly under pressure. Looking at it, I like the look of it.\"",
      "Keane lay down his challenge for Sesko, to get up and running as soon as possible and hopefully score against old foes Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season.",
      "The 54-year-old added: \"This is a big start. We saw players already putting a marker down this weekend so for any striker, Sesko, who goes to a new club, if he’s starting can he get up and running? Score a goal? Get that trust and belief not only from supporters of the club but from his teammates.\"",

And all those football brains couldn’t be wrong, could they?",
      "But if this is true, it is a time of danger to the United behemoth because there is much entertainment in watching them fail. It’s funny for the rest of us, representing – as it does – the collapse of the elites more broadly. In this world where failing upwards to positions of power and responsibility is sickeningly common, seeing expensive, over-vaunted players being useless is very satisfying and makes the world seem more sane.",

      "In other words, if they want to maintain their global position as one of the world’s biggest clubs, they need to get good and quickly. Winning a few, losing a few, simply won’t do. They have to aim at the top six to retain the level of interest they’re used to; being average is an interest-killer.",
      "Because this is a fanbase increasingly drawn from an encouraged tourist trade and they can’t be relied upon to keep buying all the expensive tat and snapping up over-priced tickets to watch mediocrity. TV people also want to build up their games as A Big Event and trying to do that when they keep getting turned over won’t do. They’re used to selling them with inappropriate hyperbole. But you can’t sell sh*t as sugar forever.",

No time to build, no time for bedding in; you’ve had those days. Be successful now. That’s the be all and end all.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair – in many ways he’s like the current government taking the blame for but having to deal with 14 years of the worst, most irresponsible, lunatic and hapless government. It’s not his fault, but nonetheless he’s got to do something about it. Does he look like he can?",

      "",
      "8=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nA goal in the Community Shield and then another in the opening Premier League game v Manchester United puts the Frenchman higher in the betting than Virgil van Dijk or Alexis Mac Allister.",

      "8=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nA shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",
      "",
      "8=) Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nGenuinely odd inclusion after a pretty universally rotten 24/25. But he is a former winner.",
      "",
      "7) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nIt literally took about 45 minutes against Wolves to convince everybody that the Dutchman is absolutely brilliant and could help win Manchester City another title.",

      "6) Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nIt’s interesting that Viktor Gyokeres is a rank outsider for the PFA award when his signing is likely to be the difference between being runners-up and finally winning some kind of trophy. But Rice is clearly a popular figure with his peers.",
      "",
      "1=) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League.",
      "",

      "",
      "1=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer has to be on this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger."

Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",

      "5) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",

      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd.",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",

He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",

I warn you, this sort of pathetic aversion to physical contact will kill the game, and any fan who cries about that sort of thing is going to contribute to the sort of public pressure that created the shit show that is VAR and stupid rules like ‘delaying the restart’ and whatever that rubbish was that disallowed Eze’s free kick. And if you are moaning about Saliba’s non-foul, imagine a scenario where the goal is disallowed but a penalty immediately given for the exact same offence (much worse) by Cunha on Zubimendi.

      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",

      "",
      "19) James Trafford (Burnley to Manchester City, £27m to £31m, July 2025)\nBurnley were claiming this was a British record fee for a goalkeeper while Manchester City were briefing that they had only paid an initial £27m for their former keeper. Any which way, it’s a decent whack of money for an uncapped player. But that status will surely only last so long…he was in the England picture even while in the Championship.",
      "",
      "18) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "16) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "15) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "14) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "13) Jarell Quansah (Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m to £35m, July 2025)\nA winner of the U19 and U21 Euros, having captained England at various levels and been on Gareth Southgate’s standby list for Euro 2024, is destined to make the senior grade at some point.",
      "Quansah was even in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad and Liverpool will be among those keen to monitor how he fares in Germany.",
      "",
      "12) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "11) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "10) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",

      "",
      "9) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "8) Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town to Nottingham Forest, £37.5m, August 2025)\nA year after joining Ipswich Town for a doomed year in the Premier League, the Tractor Boys almost doubled their money when Nottingham Forest came calling with a big pile of Anthony Elanga money. He has played for Jamaica but has since switched allegiances back to England, winning the Under-21 Euros in 2024.",
      "",
      "7) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "6) Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa to Newcastle United, £39m to £43m, August 2025)\nIt feels like a lot of money for a player who started just half of Aston Villa’s Premier League games the season before, but then you remember that West Ham paid £40m for…",
      "",
      "5) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Man City have made an offer of £250m for Chelsea superstar Cole Palmer as they look to bring him back to the Etihad Stadium, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been rejected by Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, while Arsenal have decided to ‘distance’ themselves from a deal, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak is ‘training alone’ amid uncertainty over his Newcastle, who have been dealt another huge blow as a second star ‘wants to join’ Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea have turned down a huge bid from Premier League rivals Man City as they look to re-sign Cole Palmer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly bracing themselves for an ‘improved offer’ from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz with Anthony Gordon on their list of replacements."

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "8=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "3=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "3=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",

      "17th (Brentford) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” he has at his disposal at Manchester United and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Bayindir was a surprise selection ahead of Andre Onana at Old Trafford and flapped at Declan Rice’s inswinging corner to gift Riccardo Calafiori the easiest chance to score with a header at the back post for the Gunners.",
      "Roy Keane urged the Turkey international to use “violence” to get to the ball ahead of the attacking players and Amorim admits his players – including Bayindir – need to match the aggression of their opponents from set pieces.",
      "“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same,” Amorim said when asked if he was disappointed with the goal. “When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.",
      "“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No, (I’m not saying he should have acted differently) I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball, he chose to get the ball but he didn’t push so he cannot defend it.",
      "“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "When it was suggested Bayindir was at fault, Amorim responded: “He suffered a goal like this (before) when?",
      "And when a reporter reminded him of Tottenham last season, Amorim replied: “But without VAR. With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game against Arsenal? Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game?",
      "“You don’t remember the game, I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one in or the other (goalkeeper). I choose Altay.”",
      "Amorim was then asked about his decision not to include Onana in the squad after the Cameroon international was his No.1 last season.",
      "Amorim said: “I didn’t drop Onana from the squad. It is not the case of dropping Onana. Not putting in Andre Onana after just one week without seeing a game, without time training.",
      "“Tom and Altay, during the pre-season they did a very good job.”",
      "United have been heavily linked with a number of goalkeepers this summer, with Gianluigi Donnarumma’s decision to leave Paris Saint-Germain leading to suggestions he should be targeted.",
      "Pushed on whether he is happy with his current goalkeeping options and if the club need to sign another, Amorim continued: “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League. Especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team.",
      "“I’m happy with the players. I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is already in a battle to keep his job at Manchester United; they cannot finish outside the top six.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had his first rant of the season after a reporter suggested Tom Heaton would have been a better choice between the sticks.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville reckons his former club have a “glaring issue” that “can’t be ignored” as they should sign a Premier League star.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been criticised for a “terrible substitution” in Man Utd’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Roy Keane branded Man Utd ‘weak and soft’ at half-time in their clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford and urged ‘violence’ from one of Ruben Amorim’s players.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s first big call of the season came back to bite him just 13 minutes into Man Utd’s opening game against Arsenal."

      "Bryan Mbeumo humbled Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres in the war of the debutants but Manchester United may be reconsidering that £100m Bruno Fernandes call.",
      "",
      "1) A unique set of circumstances is required to produce a meeting between clubs the size of Arsenal and Manchester United from which the loser emerges generally happier than the winner.",
      "The emotions usually run too high, the resentment too bitter, the rivalry too deep and the bragging rights too enticing for analysis and introspection to override outcome bias.",
      "But a collapsed giant in 15th spending a similar amount to the perennial runners-up to bridge a 32-point gulf in quality, even just in a one-off game, only feeds the narrative of one side finding its feet at the start of a grand rebuild while the other stagnates and struggles to make the final step.",
      "",
      "2) The challenge as ever for Manchester United is to use this platform and these foundations properly.",
      "This was not the calibre of game Amorim’s side failed to show up in last season. He engineered a victory over Manchester City, draws with Liverpool, Arsenal and City and single-goal defeats to Spurs and Chelsea in his few chastening months since being appointed.",
      "It reached the point where a spirited draw at Anfield left the manager “really mad” because “we have to do it against any opponent,” while captain Bruno Fernandes said he “wasn’t worried about people putting in effort today because it’s Liverpool, everyone’s going to try to do their best. I’m more worried about Southampton”.",
      "Amad rescued them with a hat-trick in the final ten minutes of that game but Amorim was breaking televisions against Brighton a few days later and the club’s only Premier League victories from February up to the final day were at home to Ipswich and away at Leicester.",
      "Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal will and should invoke the cliche about the three points being the most important thing for the next few days.",
      "There is still some sense of achievement in gutting out a win at an invigorated but dilapidated Old Trafford, and avoiding the loss of any title race ground this early is necessary if the initial aim is to avoid complete and total head loss.",
      "Liverpool and Manchester City can make their four-goal statements before Arsenal stumble over their words, but the final message was all the same. And Chelsea showed that the title tag can weigh heavy for those unprepared.",
      "The run also goes on: Arsenal remain unbeaten in 22 Premier League games against the rest of the Big Six, dating back two and a half years. It is a phenomenal record.",
      "",
      "4) But Mikel Arteta knows that there will come a time when style and substance must amalgamate, when performances and results coalesce. 1-0 to the Arsenal is a fun chant, not a sustainable diet.",
      "The Spaniard’s measured post-match take was heartening, with a healthy balance of satisfaction with the result and contentment with certain aspects of the game, but an acceptance that the standard has to be much higher when the pre-season kinks are ironed out.",
      "“Twenty-two years at Old Trafford without winning before I came,” he said. “Now I go into the dressing room, we won and they’re not happy. It’s a good sign.”",
      "That mentality and the ability to grind out a result will be imperative and routinely ignored by the critics. But Arsenal have to show soon that £200m has been spent to add more feathers to their bow than set pieces in this turbocharged nuclear title war.",
      "",
      "5) Having Viktor Gyokeres up to anything resembling speed would have been useful.",
      "A challenger signing a brutish Scandinavian striker who ostensibly changes their entire style makes the comparison a bit on the nose but no less inevitable when it comes to Erling Haaland.",
      "And 21 touches with four passes completed in an hour really underpinned that same all-or-nothing narrative Gyokeres will bring to the table.",
      "The plan cannot have been for him to have more crosses or clearances than shots, although that neat centre-forward trick of relieving pressure by winning fouls on the halfway line with no teammate within 20 yards will be particularly handy when defending those narrow leads.",
      "But really – and understandably – the team’s instincts of playing with that brand of attacking spearhead were not there and will take time to develop.",
      "There were two moments when he was played in out wide, on either side and in either half, and the Sporting iteration of Gyokeres might have expected to battering ram his way inside before finishing with at least one plomb. But an overhit ball which soared over all three teammates, and a clumsy run which ended with him stepping on the ball in the area and fouling a defender, pointed to a player some way off the pace.",
      "Maybe going on strike to force a move which was always likely to happen and thus missing most of pre-season wasn’t too bright an idea. A shiny penny to whomever is first to ask whether Arsenal are better without him.",
      "",
      "6) Kai Havertz gave compelling ammunition to that question in his 30 minutes. Arsenal naturally looked smoother and more coherent when he came on but the difference in sharpness, technical levels and decision making against what came before with Gyokeres was clear.",
      "That competition and variation should only benefit Arsenal – once Gyokeres has regained the physicality which made him such an obvious addition.",

      "7) On the other end of the debutant excitement scale, those Manchester United ‘policy’ signings look proper.",
      "The Premier League premium can be excessive but the plug-in-and-play performances of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo showed why clubs charge and pay them.",
      "With no time needed to acclimatise to the league and its demands, an entire attack was transformed. Cunha and Mbeumo had as many shots as Arsenal between them, and more on target. Even Benjamin Sesko looked bright and busy in his cameo.",
      "Worra trophy indeed. And ultimately it did still end with Harry Maguire chucked up front. But it turns out spending £200m on a completely new frontline while loaning out all the previous composite parts can rejuvenate it.",
      "",
      "8) It is not worth contemplating how much needs to be spent fumigating and then rectifying their other glaring problem positions.",
      "The hosts’ midfield was semi-functional. It turns out Casemiro lacks mobility and Bruno Fernandes is often stretched across a few different roles and responsibilities. A more coherent side would have exploited the gaps Mason Mount didn’t frequently drop deep to plug.",
      "But the substitutions were revealing. Kobbie Mainoo was unused and instead Manuel Ugarte was given a half-hour cameo summed up by an atrocious shot from 30 yards out to waste some excellent Sesko link-up play.",
      "Brighton are going to extract a comical amount of money from skint Sir Jim next summer for Carlos Baleba. Whether this midfield can hang on for long enough is unknown.",
      "",
      "9) The goalkeeper situation is untenable. Leaving Andre Onana out was a choice and the justification of him having barely trained after recovering from injury stands up to reason, but when his back-up is inhibited by the exact same issues of reliability to the extent that conceding a corner is tantamount to conceding a goal regardless of who stands between the posts, investing hundreds of millions on forwards is pointless.",
      "Altay Bayindir had almost nothing to do besides – certainly in terms of saves – but flapping at that corner was a game-changing moment.",
      "",
      "10) It did not help that early in the second half, when Cunha had purchased one of his many fouls from William Saliba by the corner flag, David Raya confidently and competently punched the delivery away despite being pinned on his line among a raft of bodies.",
      "The way Raya has transitioned to becoming a genuinely brilliant keeper is not spoken of often enough, nor how Arteta absolutely nailed such a ruthless decision.",
      "There were a couple of shaky moments on the ball in his own area but also some fine saves from a man starting his hunt for a third consecutive Golden Glove in decent fettle.",
      "",
      "11) That sort of brutal, cutthroat call really might need to be made on Arsenal’s left wing at some point. If Gyokeres is going to be slightly detached from team play and judged on the quality and decisiveness of his touches rather than volume, Gabriel Martinelli cannot afford to do similar.",
      "It surely wasn’t by design that two-thirds of Arsenal’s attack were isolated but Martinelli had even fewer touches and completed passes than Gyokeres despite not even being close to the sort of peripheral player in the link-up who comes alive in front of goal.",
      "One quick break collapsed due to the Brazilian’s dreadful pass, while his opportunities to test Bayindir were snatched and wasted.",

      "Ruben Amorim denied us the ‘battle of the new No.9s’ we were after from the off at Old Trafford, with Benjamin Sesko’s introduction after 65 minutes meaning he and Viktor Gyokeres were never on the pitch at the same time.",
      "And yet, we still got we wanted: the opportunity for a knee-jerk reaction. Gyokeres was – and therefore is – rubbish.",
      "He was hooked on the hour mark and deservedly so having bumbled around the pitch with the grace and skill of a pub player. His best moment of the game was a shoulder barge on Matthijs de Ligt which sent the Manchester United centre-back flying and was reposted roughly a billion times by Arsenal fans desperate for some sign of worth from their £55m ‘final piece’.",
      "Apart from that his first Arsenal outing consisted of quite a lot of running about, dodgy touches and a complete lack of goal threat. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he trod on the ball.",
      "He had no shots, completed no dribbles, made 11 passes, attempted no tackles and won one aerial duel before being replaced by Kai Havertz, who will be starting ahead of him before long if there isn’t a massive improvement. By Christmas at the latest, as one particularly astute F365er predicted.",
      "Arsenal spent most of the summer deciding between Sesko and Gyokeres and although Manchester United’s shiny new striker touched the ball just seven times in his 30-odd minutes, there were good signs from the guy Andrea Berta opted against.",
      "He had two half-chances, both fairly weak headers, but at least he was in position. And there were several moments in the first half as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha broke on Arsenal when it looked as though they were a £74m striker short of getting back into the game.",
      "Arsenal fans will blame the service to Gyokeres at Old Trafford – and they’re right to – but there’s also a sense that this was the sort of game, in which Mikel Arteta’s side weren’t particularly dominant, when there was space in behind the United defence, in which Gyokeres could have made a real difference with his famous barrelling runs, with or without the ball.",
      "Sure, he didn’t have much of a pre-season, the link between him and the midfield will take time and none of his fellow Arsenal forwards were anywhere near their best – Gabriel Martinelli completed five passes in his 60 minutes, FFS – but Gunners fans hoping for their Erling Haaland instead got a below-par Salomon Rondon.",
      "This was the first game since Gyokeres left Coventry that he hasn’t managed a shot on goal and on his Premier League debut at Old Trafford he looked far more like the guy who scored seven fewer Championship goals than Chuba Akpom in his last season in English football than the guy who’s got 97 in 102 games for Sporting since.",
      "After just half an hour, you can see how Sesko fits at Manchester United, in stark contrast to Gyokeres and Arsenal, for whom it is perhaps the unsuitability that’s as big a worry as anything.",
      "Gyokeres makes runs into the channel and Arsenal don’t play those passes. It’s a learning curve for him and his teammates, obviously, but that’s a difficult bond to forge during the season when Gyokeres’ qualities are so vastly different to those of Havertz or any of the other strikers who have led their line under Arteta.",
      "We can’t see it. One game and done for Gyokeres. Next.",

      "Arsenal beat Manchester United but it’s the Gunners who get an absolute kicking from the fans while Man Utd are optimistic.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",
      "A pundit has explained why he is ‘not convinced’ about Arsenal summer signing Viktor Gyokeres as ‘alarm bells’ have been ‘set off’ for two reasons.",
      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright has stated that Viktor Gyokeres is “another level” to Benjamin Sesko, with the Manchester United new boy’s previous returns a “worry.”",
      "A former Brighton team-mate thinks Viktor Gyokeres will flop at Arsenal this season after he was left unimpressed by the Sweden international.",

Feels a bit weird to cry out for a good centre-forward and then pretend he doesn’t exist – not that he especially helped himself when the ball did come his way. Maybe another day.",
      "We are left once again that Arteta has grown much too conservative for his own good. With the home crowd deflated by that all-too-familiar route to goal, United were there to be got at again. Kill the game off, lads? Nah. But hey: they won on the road, so fine. Chalk it up as a rugged, resilient victory.",
      "MORE FROM OLD TRAFFORD ON F365\n👉16 Conclusions on Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal: Gyokeres, Mbeumo, Martinelli, £100m Fernandes\n👉 F365 knee-jerk: Arsenal have signed a pub striker in Viktor Gyokeres",
      "Manchester United meanwhile…well, they were clearly better than Arsenal for much of the game, but to come from a goal behind, they had to be a lot better. It turns out playing nine of the side that stank the Premier League out last season plus the actually-good Bryan Mbeumo and Mattheus Cunha still isn’t a vast improvement. Better, but not great.",
      "United fans have continued reason to feel frustrated about that. For us as neutrals, though, their greatest sin in the nine-month old Ruben Amorim era is just how persistently dull they are for such long spells of games.",
      "The repeated errors Bayindir and Andre Onana have committed in that time as a valid talking point, but the criticism has been amplified by the fact that United have so rarely given us hacks anyone else of note to talk about. They only continue to call Old Trafford the Theatre of Dreams because it’s been a fantastic place to go to catch up on your sleep.",
      "Here, Mattheus Cunha was the only United player to bring any kind of verve to the side in the first half. Seeing Cunha driving his way through the entire Arsenal defence several times in the first half was particularly fun, and it took a stupendous reaction save from David Raya to keep Arsenal in front as the former Wolves man shot from a narrow angle.",
      "It wasn’t until the final half hour that United really started to click into gear. They can take some encouragement from that; it’s something, anyway.",
      "Mbeumo looked especially bright in the second half, and helped inspire United into finishing the game strongly. Amorim’s side showed quite a bit more promise here than they did at almost any other point last season. Cunha, Mbeumo and ever-dynamic substitute Amad should have better luck against less defensively capable sides than Arsenal – which, in total fairness, is basically everybody in this division.",
      "Until we see that happen, though, promise is all it is, and there is clearly still plenty more work to be done in the transfer market – particularly between the sticks.",
      "There have been plenty of other sides who have not been anything like their best and have issues to address: Liverpool, Newcastle, Villa.",
      "But for the sake of our continued sanity over the course of the season, it is United and Arsenal we most want to see raise their game and show us something more."

      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Man Utd were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in their opening Premier League game of the season; an error from Altay Bayindir led to Riccardo Calafirori's goal; Andre Onana was not in the matchday squad; Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, with Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked",
      "Monday 18 August 2025 08:34, UK",
      "The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",

      "Something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.",
      "Nuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",
      "Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.",
      "Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter",
      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",
      "A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
