      "Carrick has given his view on some late January deals(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has not totally ruled out a late signing for Manchester United as the deadline approaches. The Red Devils have yet to make any additions in the January transfer window and that looks unlikely to change ahead of Monday’s deadline.",
      "Despite that, boss Carrick has hinted that there could yet be a late surprise. Speaking ahead of this weekend’s game against Fulham, he said: \"Never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.",
      "\"Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"",
      "The Red Devils have already put a plan in place for the summer, with the club prioritising a move for a new central midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest are all long-term targets.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Each of the three are expected to cost in excess of £100m in the summer. A new defender is also potentially on the club’s shopping list but that would depend on Harry Maguire’s future, with the England star out of contract at the end of the campaign.",
      "A replacement for Bruno Fernandes might also be required. The Portuguese playmaker continues to be linked with a move away from Old Trafford and Carrick has suggested that his future will be decided at the end of the season.",
      "He said: \"We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to we want to improve as a team.",
      "Carrick has given his take on Man United's transfer plan(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "\"That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham.",
      "“Bruno's fully committed. There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.\"",
      "Either way, United will be aiming to secure a Champions League place between now and the end of the season. Ahead of this weekend’s game with Fulham, Carrick’s side sit fourth with a one-point advantage over Chelsea.",

      "Michael Carrick, interim head coach of Manchester United(Image: Nigel French/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are just one victory away from equaling Ruben Amorim’s longest Premier League winning streak as they prepare to host Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Michael Carrick’s rejuvenated side come into this fixture on a high, having edged out league leaders Arsenal 3-2 in a thrilling encounter last weekend, while Fulham strengthened their European credentials with a 2-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Since taking over from Amorim, Carrick has made an immediate impact—whether as a temporary or permanent appointment—guiding United to consecutive statement wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. After a 2-0 derby triumph, United followed up with a dramatic five-goal contest at the Emirates, where Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu, and a spectacular effort from Matheus Cunha handed Arsenal their first home defeat of the season in any competition.",
      "Carrick’s impressive start has only enhanced his prospects for a long-term role, as he becomes the first manager since February 2010 to claim back-to-back victories over the Premier League’s top two teams. United now sit in pole position in the race for fourth, holding a one-point advantage over Chelsea and a two-point cushion over Liverpool ahead of gameweek 24. Their current six-match unbeaten run is the longest in the top flight.",
      "United’s attacking reinforcements from the summer are proving their worth, with the team scoring in each of their last 11 league games and conceding just once in their last three matches at Old Trafford. Carrick has already overcome two of his toughest challenges since returning to the helm, but another test awaits as Marco Silva’s Fulham arrive with their own European ambitions.",
      "Fulham’s season started inconsistently, with nine wins and nine losses between late August and mid-December, but they have since lost just once in their last eight matches across all competitions, winning five. Harry Wilson was the hero in their latest outing, netting a stoppage-time free kick to complete a dramatic 2-1 comeback against Brighton at Craven Cottage.",
      "Sitting seventh in the table and only four points off the top four, Fulham’s improved away form has been crucial, earning 10 points from their last five Premier League away games after managing just one from their first six on the road this season. Silva’s men also held United to a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage earlier this campaign and can take confidence from their last league win at Old Trafford in February 2024—though that remains their only top-flight victory at the Theatre of Dreams in their past 20 visits.",
      "Manchester United’s versatile defender-turned-attacker Patrick Dorgu experienced both elation and disappointment against Arsenal—after netting a stunning goal-of-the-season contender, the Dane was forced off with a serious hamstring injury that is expected to sideline him for around 10 weeks. Dorgu’s absence opens the door for either Matheus Cunha or Benjamin Sesko to step into the lineup, but Cunha is likely to get the nod—either operating out wide or partnering Bryan Mbeumo, who should feature on the left—following his dramatic match-winner in North London.",
      "Aside from Dorgu, United have just two other fitness concerns: Matthijs de Ligt (back) and Joshua Zirkzee (unspecified), though neither is expected to break into the starting XI at this stage.",
      "For Fulham, manager Marco Silva could have right-back Kenny Tete available again after a thigh injury, but Rodrigo Muniz and Sasa Lukic are set to remain sidelined with similar issues. The Nigerian trio of Calvin Bassey, Alex Iwobi, and Samuel Chukwueze have all returned to the squad following their Africa Cup of Nations duties, and Chukwueze will be pushing for a starting spot after coming off the bench to score Fulham’s equaliser against Brighton.",
      "Chukwueze replacing Kevin could be one of two changes on Fulham’s left flank, as Antonee Robinson was substituted after just 59 minutes last weekend and may be replaced by Ryan Sessegnon in the starting lineup.",

      "Michael Carrick has made a fabulous start to his interim spell in charge of Man United(Image: Nigel French/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are flying high after clinching a couple of vital, feel-good wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that changes aren't afoot.",
      "With just a few days before the January transfer window slams shut, United are rapidly running out of time to bolster their squad ahead of what's shaping up to be a promising second half of the season. After spending over £200million on new recruits in the summer, the Red Devils aren't expected to splurge.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha has urged the club to temporarily shelve contract negotiations with Kobbie Mainoo following his return to the starting line-up this month. Mainoo looked certain for a departure in 2026 after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim, but has started both of interim head coach Michael Carrick's two matches in charge, suggesting that his days on the sidelines are over.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The 20-year-old's United contract expires in 2027 and while talks over an extension are ongoing, Saha believes it will be best for all parties if they step back from the negotiating table for the time being and focus on Mainoo's football instead.",
      "\"People talk about contracts and stuff like this, you know, it's not good for him,\" Saha told gambling.com. \"What he has to do is score more goals, assist more, play well and progress. That's it.",
      "\"He's only a young player who, yes, maybe played for England - and has a World Cup to look forward to. He has to improve. That's it. Why are they thinking about contract extension, moving away, looking at [Scott] McTominay's career or whatever? It's wrong. Just play, just play, just play, improve every day. It's two games, that's not enough.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's contract expires next year(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"He needs to score maybe ten goals, and then become the main man in midfield with Casemiro - and then people will give him the contract he wants. That's it. He doesn't need anyone else to speak about this extension, and think about this now.",
      "\"It's just about focusing on this game. He hasn't played for many months. He was on the bench. Now it's time for consistency. Get 15 games under his belt, bring him to the World Cup and see how it goes.\"",
      "While most of Man United's 2026 transfer plans are expected to be conducted in the summer, Carrick has left the door ajar for one or two deals to be completed before the January window closes.",
      "\"I think we are just working through it, never say never,\" he said speaking ahead of United clash with Fulham on Sunday. \"A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with.",
      "Michael Carrick has refused to rule out any late deals this window(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.\"",
      "Patrick Dorgu's recent hamstring injury has left United short of options on the left flank. The Denmark international had been in impressive form, excelling on the left wing in victories over both Arsenal and Man City, raising questions over whether the club will now look to the transfer market for cover.",
      "\"It is not ideal, of course it is not, we don't want to lose good players from the group,\" Carrick said. \"That is part of having a squad and assembling a squad to be able to cover certain things. We have got players who can do that. It is the nature of the beast, unfortunately.\"",

Business has been subdued at Old Trafford this month, as Michael Carrick focuses on achieving success in the Premier League with his existing squad.",
      "United are yet to confirm any incomings or outgoings in January, but that could change if recent reports surrounding Kone prove accurate. The 19-year-old is believed to be close to securing a loan switch to Lausanne for the rest of the campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, the defensive midfielder has been working with the Swiss Super League side for several days whilst awaiting the final details of the transfer to be completed.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS purchased the Swiss club in November 2017 and have subsequently incorporated it into a wider portfolio of European clubs, including OGC Nice and a stake in United.",
      "Given United place considerable trust in their academy starlets, it is believed that Kone will head to Lausanne for the next phase of his development. It is anticipated that the Mali youth international should receive substantial playing time with Lausanne, particularly as one of their regular midfielders, Souleymane Ndiaye, has been sidelined for up to three months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The club announced on their official website: \"Souleymane Ndiaye had a very encouraging start to the season, enjoying the confidence of the coaching staff and notably making his first start in Skopje against Vardar during the UEFA Conference League qualifiers.",
      "\"After being sidelined by several injuries for several weeks, he made his return to competition at the beginning of 2026. He came on as a substitute against Servette FC, then against BSC Young Boys, a match in which he provided an assist, contributing to Lausanne's first victory at the Wankdorf Stadium in over 13 years.",
      "\"Having suffered from pain in both shoulders for several months, the player and the club have mutually agreed to opt for surgery in order to resolve these problems in the long term. FC Lausanne-Sport wishes Souleymane Ndiaye a speedy and full recovery.\"",
      "United may be wise to be monitoring Kone's progress carefully, given they may look for a new addition in midfield this summer. Casemiro confirmed earlier this month that he'll depart the club when his contract runs out at the end of the campaign, bringing to a close an impressive four-year spell with the Reds.",
      "Announcing his departure on Instagram, the Brazilian wrote: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "Sekou Kone is set to leave Manchester United on loan",
      "Despite being linked with a host of midfielders in recent times, including Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson among others, it seems that United will bide their time and make their move in the summer transfer window rather than rushing into any hasty deals.",
      "However, with a wealth of talent emerging from the youth ranks - including Kone, Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer - it may not be long before these academy stars get their chance to shine on the big stage.",

      "Fernandes has become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes. He came close to leaving United last summer, but rejected the chance to join the Saudi Pro League.",
      "While Fernandes has been impressed with the impact Carrick has made as interim manager, he wants to see who the next permanent boss will be - and if United get back into the Champions League.",
      "The 31-year-old knows his next deal will be the last major one of his career, and that he needs to cash in. United would have to offer Fernandes a new and improved deal of around £400,000-a-week, to stand a chance of keeping him. His current deal runs until 2027, but has a buy-out clause of £60m.",

      "Dorgu has been in fine form for the Red Devils in recent weeks but injured his hamstring in the 3-2 win over Arsenal last weekend. It has since been claimed the Denmark international, 21, could be absent for as long as 10 weeks, sparking fears Carrick will be deprived of a key player for a significant period.",

      "Michael Carrick can plan for the final months of the season without the worry of fixture overload(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",
      "According to the bookmakers, Claudio Ranieri’s side were still not favourites to win the title. To a large extent, that was understandable. After all, two powerful, deep squads were breathing down their necks and Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs were playing some very decent stuff.",
      "And Leicester had finished 14th the season before. But what the bookmakers and a lot of fans and pundits did not factor in was the respective workloads.",
      "Leicester only had their remaining 15 Premier League games to deal with. Fifteen matches in 15 weeks. It turned out that, during that time, Arsenal and Spurs would play 21 times while Manchester City would play 25 times.",
      "Arsenal finished second, ten points behind Leicester. Spurs were a point further away in third, with City 15 points behind the remarkable champions. Of those last 15 matches, Ranieri’s men won ten, drew four and lost only one - a slightly controversial narrow defeat at the Emirates that saw Leicester reduced to ten men after taking the lead.",
      "In those last 15 matches, they scored 26 goals and conceded only eight. For those who put great importance on the relative workloads in the second half of the season, this was considerable weight to their argument that fixture demands can play a pivotal part in the final standings.",
      "Matheus Cunha's strike at the Emirates gave Michael Carrick his second win in two matches as Manchester United boss(Image: Getty)",
      "And a decade on, Manchester United will add a bit more weight. A decade ago, the bookmakers got it wrong when Leicester City - when leading after 23 games - were still not favourites to win the title and they have got it wrong now by having United at odds against finishing in the top four (albeit narrowly at 5/4). They should be way shorter than that.",
      "Naturally, commentators and a lot of supporters are calling for calm after the dramatic and successful start to Michael Carrick’s tenure. But a dispassionate look, not only at the fantastic victories over Manchester City at Old Trafford and Arsenal at the Emirates but at the physical demands of the remainder of the season, tells you why Carrick and United fans should be bullish.",
      "Harry Maguire has got a World Cup incentive to perform well in the final 15 games of the Premier League season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Around the training complexes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and others, the phrase you will probably hear most is ‘red zone’. Players in the red zone. Players having to have minutes managed. Presumably, we are not going to hear that from Carrick.",
      "This season, United have played 25 games across all competitions. That compares to 36 for Chelsea and Manchester City (who both played in the Club World Cup in the summer), 35 for Liverpool (if you include the Community Shield) and 33 for Aston Villa.",
      "United now have 15 games left in 15 weeks. Liverpool and Aston Villa have a minimum of 18 games left, while City and Chelsea have a minimum of 19 games. And most, if not all, those teams will face more.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is the latest casualty at Liverpool as injuries pile up for Manchester United's top-four rivals(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Considering his recent form, the injury to Patrick Dorgu is bad news for United and for Carrick, but the manager has a largely fit squad with plenty of options. It was one heck of a bench Carrick named at the Emirates. Eight of United’s remaining fixtures are at home and Carrick has a core of English players - Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and possibly even Mason Mount - who know they have 15 club games to prove they are worthy of a place in Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad.",
      "Carrick is a very impressive character, a very likeable individual, a very well-respected figure in the game, with a very good reputation at the club. The party line would probably be that it is way too early to judge, that there should be no knee-jerk reaction to two stellar results.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made his thoughts on Man United's midfield clear(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already revealed his dream midfield maestro for Manchester United. After confirmation that Casemiro is set to leave Old Trafford when the season ends, focus has naturally shifted to who could step into the Brazilian's shoes.",
      "United have been linked with a host of prominent targets, such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba. The expectation is that the club will invest heavily during the summer window to strengthen the middle of the park, especially with Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future also uncertain.",
      "However, Ratcliffe cannot land his 'dream' acquisition, as that particular star has been retired for more than a decade. In 2024, the INEOS chairman was asked which former United icon he would revive at their peak to feature under then-head coach Erik ten Hag - and he barely hesitated.",
      "\"I think I'd bring Paul Scholes,\" he said on The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast. \"That's the player that they are sort of most missing.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"They've got a couple of players who are not Roy Keane but - Casemiro and [Kobbie] Mainoo - they're sort of quite defensive midfielders, you know? But they don't have a Paul Scholes or an [Andreas] Iniesta.\"",
      "Since Ratcliffe took charge of football operations in February 2024, the Red Devils have spent in excess of £400million on new arrivals. During the 2024/25 season, recruitment efforts were clearly focused on shoring up the defence, with Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu all signed to reinforce the back line.",
      "In 2025/26, attention shifted sharply to attacking reinforcements, as United reshaped their frontline by bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With those positions now strengthened, the spotlight is firmly expected to fall on midfield recruitment in the upcoming summer window.",
      "Paul Scholes is Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 'dream' midfielder(Image: Daily Mirror)",
      "Very few available players can mirror Scholes' combination of technical excellence, creativity and precise distribution. Even so, reports indicate that United are ready to pursue one or two top-tier additions in order to complete their squad overhaul.",
      "Casemiro has been a pivotal presence in the middle of the park, registering 150 appearances over three-and-a-half seasons following his move from Real Madrid. Although his form has fluctuated, his experience and influence will be difficult to replace, particularly given Manuel Ugarte's struggles.",
      "The Uruguayan has featured from the start in only seven league games this season and speculation suggests he could be sold in the summer unless his situation improves under interim boss Michael Carrick.",
      "Casemiro will leave United at the end of the season(Image: Gareth Copley, Getty Images)",
      "Mainoo has also faced uncertainty, having fallen out of favour during Ruben Amorim's tenure. Carrick, however, quickly reinstated the England international, awarding him starts in back-to-back wins over Manchester City and Arsenal - marking his first league appearances of the season.",
      "With doubts surrounding United's midfield options and Ratcliffe's long-standing admiration for Scholes well known, the club's next transfer decision could shape the next chapter of their rebuild.",
      "With uncertainty swirling around United's midfield and Ratcliffe's admiration for Scholes well-documented, the club's next move in the market could define the next phase of their rebuild. And if they can find even a fraction of the control, creativity and authority Scholes once provided, it may finally give Old Trafford the heartbeat it has long been craving.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "We know about players using interest from Manchester United to secure improved deals at their current clubs, as Sergio Ramos hinted and Craig Bellamy confirmed. However, other players have seen their fate impacted by actual clauses involving the Premier League club.",
      "United were among the Premier League's big spenders during the summer window, forking out over £200million to bring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens to Old Trafford. It is worth noting that none of the four joined from one of United's historic rivals, Manchester City or Liverpool - indeed, no player has joined United from either of those clubs in the Premier League era and on a couple of occasions, they even had later moves blocked.",
      "Brahim Diaz was in the headlines early this month for his penalty miss in the Africa Cup of Nations final. Back in 2019, though, his name was associated with a unique clause inserted when he left City for Real Madrid.",
      "According to reports at the time from ESPN, Madrid's swoop, which would cost them up to £22m including add-ons, also carried a 15 per cent sell-on clause. If Los Blancos ended up selling Brahim to United, though, the amount would reportedly rise to 40 per cent.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The one-cap Spain international, who later redeclared for Morocco, spent three years on loan at AC Milan but didn't end up joining the Rossoneri permanently. He was welcomed back to the Bernabeu by Carlo Ancelotti, winning the Champions League in 2024 and remaining part of the picture under Xabi Alonso before the manager's spell in charge came to an early end.",
      "He wasn't the only one to leave a Premier League big-hitter for a Spanish giant and then face a Man United clause. Luis Suarez left Liverpool for Barcelona in 2014, but when the time came to leave Camp Nou, he wasn't allowed to move to Old Trafford.",
      "United weren't allowed to sign Luis Suarez from Barcelona in 2020(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Barca had seen Neymar leave for Paris Saint-Germain in a record-breaking 2017 deal and didn't want a similar fate to befall Suarez. They were understood to have named PSG and United, as well as their own fiercest rivals, Real Madrid, as no-go destinations for the Uruguayan.",
      "The striker expressed his frustration when it was time to leave Camp Nou. He ended up joining Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2020 and winning La Liga under Diego Simeone, but there was a soreness about how he was treated in Catalunya.",
      "\"What really bothered me was when they told me that I was old and that I could no longer play at a high level, be up to [the task of fronting] a great team. That's what I did not like,\" Suarez told France Football in 2021.",
      "\"If I hadn't done anything at a club like Barca for three or four seasons, I would have understood. But, every year at Barca, I scored more than 20 goals per season. I have always had good statistics, just behind Leo [Messi].\"",

      "Jose Mourinho pulled off a remarkable victory(Image: Carlos Rodrigues, Getty Images)",
      "With no European football to focus on in 2025/26 following Ruben Amorim's disappointing 15th-place finish last season and failure to secure the Europa League crown in May, Manchester United supporters will have enjoyed plenty of choice regarding which games to watch on Wednesday evening.",
      "And a famous Jose Mourinho victory may have provided Red Devils fans something to smile about amidst the club's absence. The Portuguese coach pulled off a stunning win over Real Madrid, and in doing so ensured Marseille did not qualify for the next round of the competition, leaving potential United target Robert De Zerbi's job hanging by a thread and a resignation has reportedly been handed in.",
      "Benfica's encounter with Real Madrid at the Estadio da Luz was a sight to behold on Wednesday evening. From a neutral standpoint, the fixture, which concluded 4-2 in the hosts' favour, delivered everything any quality evening under the floodlights should provide: abundant excitement, an underdog overcoming the odds, and last-gasp theatrics.",
      "While Real Madrid looked likely to also secure their place in the round of 16 headed into their match with a struggling Benfica, fate had other plans for Alvaro Arbeloa. Mourinho's side needed a miracle to have any hopes of qualifying for a knockout play-off place, given they trailed Marseille by three points and goal difference.",
      "An already monumental challenge became what appeared to be an impossible mission for the Portuguese heavyweights when Kylian Mbappe broke the deadlock 30 minutes into the contest, but Benfica were resolute in their refusal to surrender without a battle. Andreas Schjelderup equalised six minutes afterwards, before Vangelis Pavlidis sparked optimism for the home side on the cusp of half-time with a calmly taken spot-kick.",
      "Schjelderup appeared to set Benfica firmly on course to pull off a remarkable comeback nine minutes into the second period by completing his double, but Mbappe netted his second of the night four minutes later to deflate the home supporters' spirits.",
      "As word reached the Estadio de Luz regarding Marseille's 3-0 thrashing by Club Brugge during the final moments of Benfica's encounter with Madrid, it represented a final opportunity for Mourinho's team, who required just one additional goal to leapfrog the Ligue 1 contenders into 24th place.",
      "Two dismissals for Madrid during added time handed Benfica a significant boost, as Fredrik Aursnes prepared to deliver a high free-kick into the penalty area. Mourinho was spotted encouraging as many players as he could muster into the box, including goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, for one final gamble.",
      "In remarkable scenes, the keeper got the better of Madrid's backline in the aerial battle, heading home beyond a helpless Thibaut Courtois before racing away in celebration. The final whistle blew shortly after, as the home supporters went wild, recognising they had miraculously secured their place in the Champions League play-offs and been thrown a lifeline towards the knockout rounds.",
      "Anatoliy Trubin scored a dramatic winner for Benfica(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Due to his tactical approach, Mourinho might just have spared Manchester United a considerable sum in their search for a new manager. Whilst Michael Carrick has flourished at Old Trafford since taking over from Amorim, there are suggestions he may not be offered a permanent position when the season concludes.",
      "Carrick has merely accepted a caretaker role until the summer, when United are expected to review their choices and possibly settle on a more experienced boss with greater credentials, irrespective of Carrick's performance during the latter half of 2025/26.",
      "Although Oliver Glasner is presently the frontrunner, another figure who has emerged in discussions is Roberto De Zerbi. Should United determine they favour the current Marseille manager over Glasner or alternative candidates, Mourinho may have just assisted his former employers.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi could be headed for the doors of Marseille(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Reports from France on Thursday afternoon indicated that De Zerbi's position is under serious threat following Marseille's exit from the Champions League, with claims that he was absent from Clairefontaine where his squad were preparing for Saturday's fixture against Paris FC.",
      "RMC Sport also reports that talks are ongoing between all parties to reach a conclusion regarding the manager's future at his current club. Whilst nothing has been finalised yet, United would be spared having to pay compensation to Marseille should he be dismissed in the coming days, weeks or months, as he would be available as a free agent.",
      "This would represent a significant advantage for the Red Devils, particularly given they may be reluctant to spend heavily on managerial appointments following Amorim's catastrophic spell at the club. United are believed to have paid Sporting CP approximately £10million to secure his services at Old Trafford in November 2024, as he was still under contract with the Portuguese giants at that time.",
      "And considering they've just forked out a substantial sum to dismiss him earlier this month, combined with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's cost-cutting philosophy, it would be highly surprising if the Red Devils were to make the same mistake in their renewed search for a new permanent manager.",

      "The former Brighton chief, 46, joined the French giants back in the summer of 2024 and his stock remains high in the Premier League off the back of his impressive stint with the Seagulls. However, De Zerbi is in 'great danger' of the sack after failing to get Marseille through the league phase of the Champions League.",

      "He said: \"I hope that the players are aware that tonight is a professional foul. I've lost games in my career, I've rarely felt that sense of shame, being able to concede six goals in two games. I want it to have consequences on the rest of the season.\"",

      "United spent £200million to change their front line over the summer, with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha arriving. But the dismissal of Ruben Amorim earlier this month - and the positive impact made by Michael Carrick - has prompted the club's hierarchy to bide their time on further business.",

But there has been a shift inside the league, with clubs now trying to recruit younger up-and-coming stars who will retain, or increase, their value.",
      "There is more bad news from Al-Hilal for United, too, with Fabrizio Romano saying that the club are now in the final stages of agreeing a new contract for Ruben Neves.

      "Man Utd have been told to suspend contract talks with midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. (Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "Ex-Manchester United forward Louis Saha has called on the club to postpone contract negotiations with Kobbie Mainoo and, for the time being, focus on giving him more playing time after regaining his place in the XI under Michael Carrick. The 20-year-old's Old Trafford future appeared uncertain during the opening half of the season, as he battled to secure regular first-team football under ex-manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese head coach suggested Mainoo was competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a spot in their midfield - sparking whispers about a potential January departure. Following Amorim's exit and his restored role under Carrick, Mainoo has demonstrated his ability, delivering impressive displays in Premier League wins against Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Questions persist regarding the academy product's long-term prospects, though, despite holding a contract at Old Trafford until 2027, with suggestions that United are eager to commence discussions about enhanced terms and an extended deal. Yet Saha believes the emphasis should remain firmly on football matters.",
      "Saha told gambling.com: \"No, no, no, I think this is like good talk for the media and his agent and all that, to him. What he has to do is score more goals, assist more, play well and progress. That's it.",
      "\"Whatever, like that, people talk about contracts and stuff like this, you know, it's not good for him.",
      "\"He's only a young player who, yes, maybe played for England and has a World Cup to look forward to. He has to improve. That's it.",
      "\"Why are they thinking about contract extension, moving away, looking at McTominay's career or whatever? It's wrong.",
      "\"Just play, just play, just play, improve every day. It's two games, that's not enough. He needs to score maybe 10 goals, and then become the main man in midfield with Casemiro - and then people will give him the contract he wants. That's it.",
      "\"He doesn't need anyone else to speak about this extension, and think about this now. It's just about focusing on this game. He hasn't played for many months. He was on the bench.",
      "\"Now it's time for consistency. Get 15 games under his belt, bring him to the World Cup and see how it goes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been given more of a chance since the departure of Ruben Amorim.(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "There's optimism that following a shaky beginning to the campaign under United's previous manager, the dugout switch can finally unlock Mainoo's full potential once more, as he's demonstrated previously. When Saha was questioned whether Mainoo's treatment was harsh or warranted, he said: \"It was a bit of both because, obviously, Amorim had different plans. So on those plans, it needed a bit of a different type of player in midfield.",
      "\"That doesn't mean at all that Kobbie Mainoo was not a good player. It's just that he wasn't fitting the style of Amorim, so that's why it's like, okay, fair to him.",
      "\"He's the manager, he decided to challenge the player and make him improve in a certain way to actually bring something else to his game. Because maybe Amorim was really fixed on that, really focused on that piece.",
      "\"I think maybe in some games he was wrong, in some others he was not. Some, as I said, we definitely needed more legs or more confidence, more, let's say, capacity to break down the opposition. It was not the case.",
      "\"We were too slow and, now, because of a different type of game and rhythm, we managed to get Mainoo and other players in that kind of frame where those guys are playing without the need to run around like a chicken without a head.",
      "\"So it's a different type of mentality, and every manager learns; they are still learning. Even [Sir] Alex Ferguson - at his age, in his prime, was still learning some games where, okay, I made these mistakes.",
      "\"I think Amorim will see a few things that he could have done better, and a few he did really well. Michael Carrick will make mistakes as well, and Kobbie Mainoo could be less of the focal point, because he's going to be in a team that's working.",
      "\"The strikers play their part, the midfielders play their part, and the defenders. Like, I see Maguire and Martinez; it's the core that needs to be very strong, not just one player. That was maybe the kind of mistake that has been made",
      "\"You know, the kind of foundation where a team provides the challenge, and more than players provide challenges. If there were no Bruno Fernandes, or if he's not performing, you're dead. That was the problem for United. It's over. The team needs to be working together, having an advantage physically, mentally and technically.\"",

      "Barcelona have an option to buy for £26m come the end of the campaign. And given his form, the Catalans look likely to do that. Rashford has notched nine goals and provided 12 assists in 31 appearances in all competitions - a record that includes a strike in Barcelona’s 4-1 win against Copenhagen in the Champions League.",
      "And it was after that triumph that the on-loan United attacker admitted that he needed time to get to grips with playing under his new head coach.",

      "“If they do have time then the backline have to adjust. But it’s our way of playing, it brings an intensity to the game. I think when we play at this intensity it’s difficult for teams to match us.",
      "“For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to because you can’t let them rest on the ball. Whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure. So it’s a little bit different to what I’d done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it’s really good.”",
      "Flick has also given his verdict on Rashford’s performances in Spain and appears to be a big fan. He said: “I’m very happy with Marcus Rashford. Speed. Finishing. Control. He has amazing quality, really.”",
      "Rashford scored his ninth goal of the season against FC Copenhagen(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Speaking before the Copenhagen game, Flick pointed to Rashford as an example to the club’s younger players in the wake of Dro Fernandez’s controversial move to Paris Saint-Germain. He said: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season.",
      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].\"",

      "Maguire is now 32. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal, and believes the likes of Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can be developed into having a long-standing centre back partnership.",
      "While United still have the experience of Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on. But Maguire still has a lot of backing and support from senior figures at United. The England international has proved in recent games he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League.",
      "While his knowledge and experience of being at United since 2019 has seen him become a defensive mentor to the likes of Yoro and Heaven. Interim manager Michael Carrick has not been consulted, when it comes to Maguire's contract situation.",

      "The youngster featured for Darren Fletcher's Under-18s team in the FA Youth Cup clash with Derby County last week, entering as a substitute during the 2-1 fourth round triumph. It represented Kai's long-awaited debut at United's famous home ground, nearly nine years after his dad played at the Theatre of Dreams for the final time, though he's already played for the Under-18s in less illustrious surroundings.",
      "Wayne and his wife Coleen observed from the stands, despite Kai previously forbidding the former United and England skipper from watching his matches. Coleen has previously said Kai was determined from an early age there was little point in Rooney attending his youth team games.",
      "This was because of the fear that supporters would mob the former England star for signatures, which prevented him from actually viewing his son's performances. But there was no risk of that at Old Trafford, where he sat alongside Michael Carrick - the interim manager of United's first team - in the directors' box.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Speaking afterwards on his BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show, the England legend revealed the opening four words Kai uttered to him during the journey home from making his debut at the famous ground were: \"The pitch was massive.\"",
      "Rooney then dispelled the myth that the Old Trafford pitch is genuinely larger than at other Premier League stadiums. \"Steven Gerrard always used to say to me how big the Old Trafford pitch is, which it actually isn't because it's the same maximum size as a lot of grounds in the Premier League. But the surroundings make it feel bigger,\" he said.",
      "Discussing his paternal pride, the 40-year-old continued: \"Kai got moved up to the Under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton. It was a proud moment and I'm delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.\"",
      "Wayne and Coleen Rooney were at Old Trafford to watch son Kai in action(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "Kai was just 15 when he played his first minutes with United's Under-18s in August 2025. As it happens, the match came against Everton, where his father began his career and enjoyed a second spell after leaving United.",
      "He has featured sporadically for the side in the intervening months with an injury setback limiting his involvement. He has consistently caught the eye when playing, despite being one the youngest players in the squad after being fast-tracked up the ranks.",
      "Wayne and Coleen are parents to three other boys - Klay, Kit and Cass. Klay is also progressing through United's youth ranks, whilst Cass is treading his dad's path at Everton's academy, though Kit has already 'retired' rather than pursuing a career in football.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has just brought up six years at Manchester United",
      "Michael Carrick was a young coach on the backroom staff at Manchester United when Bruno Fernandes signed for the club in January 2020. Six years on, the then former player and new boy have been reunited as head coach and captain in what is another Old Trafford reset.",
      "Fernandes completed his initial £47million move from Sporting six years ago on Friday and made his debut two days later in a draw with Wolves. Now he is the beating heart of the team and, restored to an attacking midfield role by Carrick, is still proving himself as the club's most important player.",
      "The 31-year-old has 103 goals and 97 assists in 312 games for United, but he came close to leaving last summer when there was interest from the Saudi Pro League. His future is again uncertain heading into this summer.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "But Carrick has no doubt how important Fernandes is at Old Trafford, having seen the immediacy of his impact in January 2020 and the quality he still has now that the 44-year-old has returned as the club's sixth head coach since Fernandes joined.",
      "\"I've seen the impact he had as soon as he got here. I was obviously here, so I've seen it at close quarters,\" said Carrick. \"He had a huge impact straight away in so many ways. You could see the passion and how much he wanted to do well straight away.",
      "\"You've seen the quality and that's carried on all the way through and his consistency really of performances, his level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and physically be able to do it. So credit him for it in that respect.\"",

      "Fernandes has won just two trophies in his six years at United, the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024, and there is no doubt that the quality of his performances deserves more silverware.",
      "He reopened the debate over his future recently, suggesting that United wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the courage to tell him, and that he has a clause in his contract that could see him leave again this year.",
      "Carrick insists the club captain is happy and committed to United at the moment and said any discussion over what comes next will wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to we want to improve as a team,\" said Carrick. \"We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "\"That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham and Bruno's fully committed.",
      "\"There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.\"",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick has spoken to the media this afternoon ahead of Sunday's visit from Fulham in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick confirmed Joshua Zirkzee has returned to training at Carrington this week following his short time out with injury. He also refused the notion that Zirkzee was looking to leave Old Trafford before the January transfer window shuts.",
      "However, there was bad news for Patrick Dorgu. Carrick said the injury is more on the serious side than they first thought and that he will be out for a period of time, albeit a timescale has not been set.",
      "When asked about any late January transfer window moves, Carrick refused to rule out but he was calm about the situation and working with the squad he has at his disposal. The interim head coach reiterated the importance of Bruno Fernandes and insisted Mason Mount remains an important member of the team despite his chances being limited since Ruben Amorim left.",
      "Take a look back at everything Carrick said below...",
      "That is the end of our coverage on the MEN blog. Make sure to stay tuned to our website for more build-up to this weekend's game.",
      "Carrick has told Manchester United it would be \"bang out of order\" to show any complacency against Fulham on the back of two stunning wins in his first games in charge. Carrick has guided United to victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, beating the Premier League's top two in successive games to move up to fourth in the table, but the challenge this weekend will be very different.",
      "United have produced perfect game plans to take on City and Arsenal but they will be expected to dominate against the Cottagers at Old Trafford and beating sides below them in the league at home has been a challenge at times this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Carrick has refused to rule out the possibility of Manchester United signing somebody before the transfer window closes on Monday, after being dealt with a blow with the news that Patrick Dorgu has picked up a hamstring injury. Dorgu had been in fine form for United and started the past two games on the left wing, scoring against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he is now out for a couple of months after picking up the injury at the Emirates.",
      "United have insisted all January that they would only make a move for a player who was a long-term target this month and the chances of that happening were receeding, but Carrick suggested conversations around recruitment were still going on.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the first part of Carrick's press conference. Those quotes have been tidied up and we shall hear more from Carrick in the second part of his press conference later.",
      "Big fan of Mason, there is so many good things to like about him. His quality to start with, his attitude, personality. That's why we have a squad, certain times, certain games, certain players will play. As we work through the season, that will come to fruition. I like Mason a lot and he is an important player for this team and this club.",
      "I don't think we need to make too much of it, we are where we are. The feeling in the group, around the squad, the results we have had and going into the next game, I don't think the past is too relevant in that respect in terms of what has worked before. I think the boys are in a good place going into the game. It is a tough game, a really tough challenge. Marco has got them into a really good team. All of a sudden Fulham is a different game because we are at home. Taking anything for granted is bang out of order really and it might be the case the flow of the game is the same as the last two. There is no shame in that. We will deal with game in front of us and we will do whatever it takes to come out on top.",
      "I have seen the impact as soon as I got here. I was obviously here so I saw him in close quarters. He had a huge impact straightaway and in so many ways. You could see the passion, you could see how much he wanted to do well. Straightaway you could see the quality and that has carried on all the way through. His consistency of performances and level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and being physically capable to do it. There is a lot to credit him for, in that respect. Of course, we all want to win things, we all want to get better and to improve as a team, we want to be successful and that is something we want to work towards together but Bruno has been fantastic since I have been here, he was fantastic when I was here before. Nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "Let's not get too far ahead. We are working towards this game and we are talking about the window now and it is closing in a few days. That is on the agenda a little bit but my main agenda is getting through the game with Fulham on Sunday and Bruno is fully committed. No issues at all with that. Things further down the line will be addressed towards the end of the season. Everything is positive at the moment and there is no reason to be anything otherwise.",
      "Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group. It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time. That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.",
      "I think we are just working through it, never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with. We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.",
      "It is not ideal, of course it is not, we don't want to lose good players from the group. That is part of having a squad and assembling a squad to be able to cover certain things. We have got players who can do that. It is the nature of the beast, unfortunately.",
      "You have got to play with feeling, emotion, excitement. It is something we speak about. The tactical and technical side is one thing but what we have just touched on is totally something else. The boys have been there in training and in games, meetings and everything around the place they have been there in everything we have asked of them, with everything we have asked. Licha has epitomised that with how he has gone about every day and certainly in the games. We are aware about what it has taken to have the couple of weeks we have had. A couple of weeks is a couple of weeks, it is good but it is two weeks. We are definitely aware it is something we need to extend for longer. We need to respect the game, what it takes to win games, how hard it is and how good a team Fulham are. That is definitely at the forefront of our minds.",
      "Consistency is the key to success it is one of the most difficult things to achieve. It takes so much, it takes a level of performance, a level of mentality, intensity and concentration and actually being able to cope emotionally with the ups and downs of what this game brings and moving onto the next. There is so many things that kind of go into it. That is what we are working towards it, we have had a great couple of weeks - two big results. There is big games coming up. It is about keeping the mind in the right place as much as the emotions to go onto the next game just as we have done the previous two.",
      "Josh is back training this week, which is good news. He has been out for a short amount of time, first training with us since we have been here so that is great to have Josh back. Pat unfortunately is going to be out for a period of time. Still working through how long that is going to be. Disappointing because he has had such a big couple of weeks, we weren't sure if it was a little bit of cramp or if it was something more serious, at the moment it is looking a little bit more of a serious note. A few weeks out, how many weeks? We will have to wait and see. It is disappointing for all of us and Pat, he is in such a good place but unfortunately it is part of football and something you have got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.",
      "De Ligt is not training with us yet. Just working through the process of getting him back as soon as we can.",
      "Carrick is here and the press conference is about to begin. Stay tuned for updates...",
      "We are just 15 minutes away from hearing what Carrick has to say ahead of United's clash with Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United will not move for Cole Palmer, the Chelsea and England star, this summer for two key reasons. Firstly, and simply, United bosses know that Palmer, a boyhood supporter of the club, is out of the club's price range this summer. And secondly, an attacking midfielder is not on the club's list of priorities when it comes to strengthening the side.",
      "United invested almost £135million in the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, while also spending big on a new No.9 in Benjamin Sesko. With Amad making rapid progress too, they aren't short of options in attacking positions, and believe other areas need greater attention this off-season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "When Carrick sits down in front of the media this afternoon, there is a number of topics which could come up. Here's what we expect him to discuss in 45 minutes:",
      "We are just one hour away from the start of Carrick's press conference! Carrick will be sitting down at 1:15pm with his quotes embargoed until 1:30pm. Once the embargo lifts, we will have everything the interim boss has to say.",
      "If Michael Carrick wants to take the Manchester United job permanently, he has got off to the best possible start winning over the hearts and minds of everyone at Old Trafford. Thanks to his success as a player, the fans were already willing to give the former midfielder a fair go. The boardroom and the existing players were always going to be the ones he would find it more difficult to convince. While Ineos chose to put their faith in Carrick until the end of the season, there is a sense the appointment was made to give them more time to sort a long-term plan.",
      "Had Ruben Amorim left at the start of the summer, it would have been surprising if Carrick was anywhere near the conversation to replace him. Therefore, the 44-year-old needed to convince Ineos he is more than just a caretaker keeping things ticking over - should he want the job permanently.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal. It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United bosses are yet to decide on what to do about Harry Maguire - with club chiefs understood to be split over the future of the veteran centre-back. Maguire, now 32, will become a free agent in June, and has not been offered a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford. He is allowed to open talks with other clubs - and his representatives from 'Triple S Management' have been in dialogue with some from across Europe..",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal. Instead, he believes young duo Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can develop into a long-term partnership, while United also have Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on - a duo still in the mid 20s but whom boast a wealth of experience.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Good morning and welcome along to the United press conference blog! The Reds welcome Fulham to Old Trafford this weekend with spirits high after brilliant wins over City and Arsenal. Carrick is likely to be in a good mood but only if the news surrounding Dorgu's injury is good. The Dane limped off during the defeat to the Gunners and while Carrick suggested it was cramp, reports claim the winger could be out for ten weeks with a hamstring complaint. United fans are also set to protest against the ownership before the game and Carrick could well be asked about this in his press conference.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN's Manchester United live transfer blog on Friday, January 30.",
      "The end of the January transfer window is nearly upon us and United are expected to be busy in the final few days. Transfer business could still happen at Old Trafford before Monday's February 2 deadline.",
      "Despite a quiet window so far, United have been linked with some big moves in the last couple of weeks. Cole Palmer is the big name after reports suggested the Chelsea star was homesick.",
      "Recently, Barcelona's Raphinha has emerged as a new target. The switch to a back four means United are expected to prioritise more attackers in the summer, with a new left winger needed.",
      "On the pitch, we'll hear from Michael Carrick today ahead of United's Premier League clash against Fulham. After beating Manchester City and Arsenal in their last two games, United will be hoping to cement their Champions League hopes.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With that said, we’ll keep you updated with the latest news right here.",
      "Chelsea have put a €200million (£173m) price-tag on Cole Palmer to ward off interest from the likes of Manchester United. According to Fichajes, that's the price United will have to pay if they want to sway him to Old Trafford.",
      "However, even that may not be enough for the Blues, who have also said Palmer is \"untouchable\" and is expected to remain where he is. He also signed a deal keeping him at the club until 2023 when he arrived at the slub in the summer of 2023.",
      "Michael Carrick's sobering comments on Patrick Dorgu suggests Manchester United will be without him for a while. The interim boss said: \"Pat, unfortunately, he's going to be out for a period of time. We're still working through how long that's going to be,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"We'll have to see, it's disappointing, he's had such a big couple of weeks, Pat. We weren't sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or whether it was something a little bit more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious note.",
      "\"So, it'll be a few weeks for that. How many weeks? We'll have to wait and see. So, that's disappointing for all of us really, and for Pat, he's in such a good place, but unfortunately it is part of football and it's something we've got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.\"",
      "If he is to be out for a pivotal few weeks, it beggars the question as to whether United should strengthen in the attacking areas he would have filled.",
      "Manchester United legend Jaap Stam has told his former club to sign Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. He told TeamTALK: \"I really like Carlos Baleba at Brighton and think he could replace Casemiro at Manchester United.",
      "“I like Frenkie de Jong a lot too, but it looks as though he’ll be staying at Barcelona. Manchester United need to be looking for a replacement that has good legs and the engine to run up and down the field. They also need to be very good with the ball too. Baleba can do that.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo looks to be stepping up his levels and has been performing very well. Alongside him, you need a player who has quality on the ball, who can defend well, and can at times also join in the attack, get into the box and maybe score or create goals for his teammates.”",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that Joshua Zirkzee could be allowed to leave Man United on loan, with 'negotiations underway' with Juventus.",

      "You could see the passion, you could see how much he wanted to do well. Straightaway you could see the quality and that has carried on all the way through.",
      "His consistency of performances and level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and being physically capable to do it.",
      "There is a lot to credit him for, in that respect. Of course, we all want to win things, we all want to get better and to improve as a team, we want to be successful and that is something we want to work towards together but Bruno has been fantastic since I have been here, he was fantastic when I was here before. Nothing but good things to say about him.",

      "The 44-year-old was brought in mid-season to guide the club through the remainder of the campaign, after Ruben Amorim's spell at United came to an abrupt conclusion.",
      "With the Premier League standings still fluid, there's a feeling that European qualification remains achievable if Carrick can navigate the team successfully.",
      "The initial indications are promising, with strong displays and results against Manchester City and Arsenal, hinting that there's plenty more potential to be unlocked.",
      "Whilst the outcome of the remaining fixtures is yet to be determined, Keane appears to have altered his stance on the interim manager after merely two matches.",
      "During an appearance on Stick To Football, he stated: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",

      "\"Yeah, but I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.\"",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",

      "Michael Carrick has impressed with two wins in two at Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",

      "That appeared to highlight a past dispute between the two, but the interim boss has kept his attention firmly on matters at Old Trafford.",
      "Whilst it may have taken some persuading, wins against both Man City and Arsenal have certainly strengthened Carrick's credentials for the permanent manager's position.",
      "It's not merely the results, but the displays as well, which have demonstrated the proper balance of resolute spirit alongside attacking sharpness.",
      "Though it might still be premature for many to assess the former midfielder on such limited evidence thus far, a clearer picture of his team's true capabilities may emerge when they face Fulham this weekend.",
      "Carrick isn't letting it go to his head, though, and he's unlikely to be drawn into speculation about remaining as permanent manager any time soon, telling his side to stay \"humble\" as they look to push on.",

      "Senne Lammens comes to clear another corner against Arsenal",
      "Senne Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal.",
      "It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "In contrast, Lammens looked unflappable. The trust his defenders have quickly developed in him was made clear by Harry Maguire's Instagram post on Monday. The image showed Lammens surrounded by at least 13 players and included the captain 'Come on Senne Lammens punch another one clear for us\".",
      "It was a calm and composed performance from a young goalkeeper developing a reputation for just those traits. Lammens is just 23, which is no age for a first-choice goalkeeper, and is also relatively inexperienced. He made just 68 appearances in Belgium's top division before signing for United for £18.2million this summer.",
      "That was a battle won by the club and the scouting department, particularly goalkeeping talent spotter Tony Coton, who liked the look of Lammens. It was a gamble to sign a goalkeeper from Belgium and throw him straight in at Old Trafford, but he has had a good season and has the longevity that Emiliano Martinez doesn't. The Argentine was the man that Ruben Amorim wanted in goal.",
      "Lammens was so composed on debut that he was serenaded with chants of 'Are you Schemichel in disguise?'. His work with the ball at his feet has been risk-free and he is commanding in his box. There have been none of the jitters that accompanied the sight of Bayindir competing for a high ball.",
      "Senne Lammens has impressed since joining(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also exudes calm to those in front of him, unlike Onana. Lammens is an organised goalkeeper capable of making good decisions. With Onana, you were never quite sure what was going to happen next, and that kind of uncertainty can spread to a defence.",
      "As you would expect from any young goalkeeper, Lammens hasn't been faultless, but his errors haven't been as glaring as those committed by Onana and Bayindir. He didn't have a great game in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth and could have done better with Everton's goal in their win at Old Trafford. Compared to what came before, these are minor quibbles.",
      "In fact, the best thing you can say about Lammens is that nobody is really talking about him, and for a goalkeeper, that is a good position to be in. If your goalkeeper is attracting a lot of attention, it is rarely good news.",
      "Lammens' name was prominent again on Thursday morning, but for his goalscoring rather than his goalkeeping. Anatoliy Trubin's dramatic header for Benfica against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday was a stunning moment, and Lammens knows how it feels to score against the Spanish giants, albeit at a slightly different level.",
      "He did just that for Club Brugge against Real Madrid's youngsters in the UEFA Youth League back in 2019. His header secured a point in a 2-2 draw. He has already been up for a corner for United this season, adding to the chaos at Tottenham when Matthijs de Ligt got an injury-time equaliser.",
      "Maybe one day Lammens can follow in the footsteps of Peter Schmeichel by scoring for United. For now, just trying to get close to the standards he set in goal for the club is enough.",

      "Cole Palmer celebrates scoring at Old Trafford",
      "Cole Palmer couldn't hide his anger on his last visit to Old Trafford. Returning to a stadium he used to frequent as a young Manchester United supporter, he endured a miserable 20 minutes before a recurrence of a groin injury that has wrecked his season for club and country.",
      "Palmer pointed to the problematic groin when he became the third Chelsea player to be substituted in a disastrous opening to the match last September. He grabbed his heavy jacket to shield himself from the torrential rain and trudged down the touchline towards the tunnel.",
      "The 23-year-old might well hope for a happier return at some point in the future. Born in the United hotbed of Wythenshawe, Palmer's allegiances to the red side of Manchester have never been a secret. A photo of him wearing the 2010/11 home kit often surfaces on social media.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The question is whether he will ever get to wear the red of United again. There are people who grew up with Palmer who believe he will want to make that happen at some point in his career.",
      "Speaking in January of this year, he talked about the enjoyment he gets from going back to Old Trafford and the memories it stirs in him. Plenty of professional footballers cast their loyalties aside once the sport becomes their job, but it seems Palmer still has a soft spot for his boyhood club.",
      "That has never affected his professionalism at Chelsea. He has scored four goals against United for the Blues and is tied down at Stamford Bridge on a contract that lasts until 2033.",
      "Cole Palmer had a difficult time of it on his last return to Old Trafford(Image: (Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images))",
      "A return to Manchester is almost impossible to see at the moment, but that doesn't mean it should be written off for good. Circumstances would need to align, but if they did, Palmer would likely jump at the chance. A few months after signing for Chelsea, the uncomplicated Mancunian was talking about the difficulty of life in the capital.",
      "“London is different to Manchester, in terms of how big it is, and off the pitch doing stuff on my own, it’s difficult,\" he said while on England duty.",
      "He is nearly three years on from that now. He returns home to see friends and family regularly, but his frustration this season stems from those fitness issues. He has played just twice in eight Champions League fixtures and has started just 10 of 23 Premier League games, completing 90 minutes on just three occasions. His progress has stalled, and his place in England's World Cup squad is vulnerable.",
      "Chelsea's new head coach, Liam Rosenior, this week played down reports linking Palmer with a move to Old Trafford and said he had no reason to seek guarantees he wouldn't be sold.",
      "\"There's no reason for assurance. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere. There's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation. That's where I'm at,\" he said.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. I've had numerous conversations with him. Our thoughts are on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him. He loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player. You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth. There's no point in having a discussion about it.",
      "\"It's simple. Cole is an incredible player. I'm not surprised at the timing. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there are people unsettled. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him back on the pitch.\"",
      "Palmer is simply not going to be going anywhere this summer. A move to United is something he would be open to at some stage, but there are clear roadblocks to that.",
      "His lengthy Chelsea contract, for starters, and his status as someone who is seen as untouchable at Stamford Bridge. This season might be heading towards being a write-off, but he has plenty of credit in the bank. There is also the issue of whether United would want him or could afford him.",
      "Cole Palmer in a Manchester United shirt as a child",
      "As a left-footed attacker, there is no room for him at his boyhood club. Patrick Dorgu, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo can all play off the right, while Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha are options at No. 10. United's priority lies in midfield, and if they strengthen the attack, it will be on the left wing, a position Palmer is unsuited to.",
      "There is no doubt that Palmer returning to Manchester to sign for United would be one of the biggest transfers in Premier League history. It would turn heads and be a serious coup. Director of football Jason Wilcox knows Palmer from their time together at the Manchester City academy.",
      "There would also be a romanticism to it. Palmer grew up idolising Wayne Rooney. He was so devoted to United that he would sometimes wear club kit to training with the City academy, just to remind himself of his loyalties as much as anything.",
      "If anything, maybe United missed their chance back then. Academy coach Colin Little told the Talk of the Devils podcast last year that Palmer was close to moving across town at the age of 16, only to stick with City. His struggles to nail down a spot in the first team at the Etihad led to his £42.5million switch to Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "He has lit up the Premier League since then and is regularly considered one that got away for Manchester City. Maybe he's one that got away for Manchester United as well. One of their own who was born down the red, but whose professional journey so far has taken in the Etihad and Stamford Bridge, but not Old Trafford.",
      "That's not going to change this summer. But that doesn't mean it will never happen. There might come a time in the next few years when Palmer sees himself back in red.",

      "Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha celebrate the Brazilian's winner at Arsenal(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United bosses are yet to decide on what to do about Harry Maguire - with club chiefs understood to be split over the future of the veteran centre-back.",
      "Maguire, now 32, will become a free agent in June, and has not been offered a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford. He is allowed to open talks with other clubs - and his representatives from 'Triple S Management' have been in dialogue with some from across Europe..",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal. Instead, he believes young duo Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can develop into a long-term partnership, while United also have Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on - a duo still in the mid 20s but whom boast a wealth of experience.",
      "However, England international Maguire still boasts a lot of backing and support from senior figures at United. And he has proved in recent games that when fit and focused, he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League.",
      "Behind the scenes, his knowledge and experience of being at United since his £80million switch from Leicester City in 2019, has seen him become a defensive mentor to the likes of Yoro and Heaven.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Interim boss Michael Carrick has not been consulted on the subject of Maguire, when it comes to his contract situation. However, Carrick has let it be known Maguire is still valued, and remains an integral part of the team's future.",
      "It's understood Maguire is reluctant to move abroad and uproot his young family. He knows his best chances of winning more England caps in the future will be improved if he remains at Old Trafford. And he is willing to accept a reduction of his £200,000-a-week wages.",
      "Co-owner Ratcliffe lacks experience when it comes to running a football club, and there are serious questions around whether he understands the bigger picture when it comes to some of United's senior players.",
      "Brazilian midfielder Casemiro has already announce he will leave in the summer, and there's a chance skipper Bruno Fernandes could do the same. United already have a problem when it comes to leaders among the club's playing contingent, and losing the aformentioned duo and Maguire would further expose the problem.",
      "United are in rebuilding mode but defence is not one of the priorities. And if Maguire is still capable of being a colossus in the biggest games, like he has been in the recent wins over Manchester City and Arsenal, it would make no sense to let him walk out of the door.",
      "There's no doubt Maguire has had tough times during his Old Trafford career, frozen out by managers looking for something else - and of course being stripped of the captaincy by Erik ten Hag.",
      "But he has shown remarkable character and resilience to come back fighting and prove those who doubted him wrong. Ultimately he outlasted both Ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "Michael Carrick has supported the academy.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC/Getty)",
      "Wayne Rooney has praised Michael Carrick and his staff for attending Manchester United academy games. Rooney believes that support for the club's youth system had been \"missing\" before Carrick's return.",
      "Carrick attended an Under-21 game at Leigh Sports Village last Tuesday and showed further support for the Under-18s at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup. He was joined by his staff and both occasions.",
      "Ruben Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Rooney sat alongside Carrick in the directors' box at Old Trafford to watch the U18s because his son, Kai, made an appearance from the bench. And United's all-time top goalscorer believes it's important to have first-team representation at academy fixtures to show support to youngsters.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Rooney said: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy, which is important for that football club. I have a different focus watching my son.",
      "\"Potentially in the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest. t was great to see them all.",
      "\"He [Kai] has upped the age group to play in the Youth Cup. He helped them get the win. It was a proud moment for me. Even on Saturday, they were all [first-team staff] at the Under-16 game as well before they travelled to London [to face Arsenal]. It has been missing. I have been quite vocal on this.",
      "\"It has been missing in the last few years. It is great to see that coming back into the club. When we had a Sunday game, after training, we used to finish training and go and watch the academy games.",
      "\"That was the norm. That is what I have known at Manchester United. With my two lads in the academy, I haven’t seen that. It was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players, and the players’ parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.\"",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could change his manager's mind and earn a starting role, Amorim, without any prompting, said: \"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Toby Collyer in the press conference, saying: \"He’s from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United.\"",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates after Manchester United's win over Arsenal(Image: (Marc Atkins/Getty Images))",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe was delighted after Manchester United’s win over Arsenal. Carrick was summoned for talks with Ratcliffe in the Emirates Stadium tunnel after the Reds moved into the top four with a 3-2 victory over the Gunners.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead just before the half-hour mark when Lisandro Martinez put the ball through his own net, but Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a horror backpass by Martin Zubimendi to draw his side level before the break.",
      "Patrick Dorgu then fired United ahead, but Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for the Gunners when he bundled the ball home from close-range.",
      "But Matheus Cunha had other ideas, as his stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. Following the game, Carrick held talks with Ratcliffe, but when put on the spot about what was discussed, he gave very little away except revealing his boss was a very happy man.",
      "“No, not much as you would expect, I think,” he told Viaplay. “There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",
      "“Last week was good for different reasons. This one is pretty special. Two good games – it’s about what’s next now and moving forward.”",
      "Reflecting on the win in the capital, Carrick said: \"We understood the start of the game was going to be like that, as much as we tried to turn the momentum in our favour.",

      "Before he continued: \"We were having a decent spell and seemed to be coming into the game when they scored, which was disappointing. Again, we showed the character to come back and there were stages in the game where you have to defend.",
      "“They make you defend the box really and it's challenging at times, but I thought we had enough in the game to keep believing in the confidence and I always fancied us to score.",
      "“The goals were fantastic goals, some of the football was good and we looked dangerous at certain times. There’s other times you have to defend. It was a performance with a bit of everything.”",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",

Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Solskjaer and Carrick contended for the interim job this season.(Image: 2021 Alex Livesey - Danehouse)",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he has spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating him to the Manchester United interim job. Carrick, Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered to take charge of United for the remainder of the campaign, but Carrick landed the role.",
      "United sources described Carrick as 'impressive' throughout the interview process, and he made a dream start to his interim role by overseeing a stunning victory against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas in August. The Norwegian was responsible for Besiktas crashing out of Europe and was axed after just seven months in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick got a first taste of coaching as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and he was retained when Solskjaer took over. Carrick has remained in touch with Solskjaer since working with him during that spell.",
      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",
      "Carrick after beating Arsenal in November 2021.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I think the confidence I'm taking going into the game is what we've seen since I've been here between me and my staff in terms of the game itself, training, how the boys have gone about it. Games from three or four years ago. It's done. It's in the past,\" he said.",
      "\"So as much as the experience kind of helps you in certain moments, I think it's a totally different game on Sunday and two teams going into it, looking forward to it in good shape.\"",
      "Speaking about United's game plan at the Emirates on Sunday, Carrick said: \"I think it's just playing to what we feel the game needs, really.",
      "\"It's never the same. Even if you come in half time and you've had a good performance for 45 minutes, I'm never one that likes to say same again because it's never, ever the same again. You've got to build on it. So it won't be kind of copy and paste.",
      "\"I think there's new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, we need to be at our best. And if we are our best and we're there, we feel we've got a good chance.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",
      "This has fuelled fresh speculation regarding a possible exit from Man Utd, with Saudi Pro League teams and Bayern Munich mooted as potential destinations for the midfielder, who has sparkled in Michael Carrick’s first two games as interim boss.",
      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’.",

      "10) Kai Havertz (Arsenal) – £280,000 a week\nArsenal had to give Havertz a little bump up when they signed him from Chelsea, where he was already on a quarter of a million per week. That sweetener adds up to £1.5million a year.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak is being paid £14.56m a year, an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player. Which he will have to justify when he’s back from injury.",
      "",
      "8) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest. So it’s especially sickening for the Merseysiders that he may miss the rest of the season.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "5) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money up to this season, but it is now a matter for debate.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. The Brazilian is earning his coin again but only until the summer when there will be no renewal.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. A £2.6million-a-year pay rise was viewed as more than worth it to keep the Egyptian around – and to spare the cost of replacing him – but half a season later, we’re considerably less sure.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "Roberto De Zerbi has reportedly ‘offered to resign’ from Marseille after their embarrassing exit from the Champion League while club chiefs consider whether to sack him.",
      "An excellent first campaign in charge saw them qualify for the Champions League, but inconsistency has cost them this season, with a 3-0 defeat to Club Brugge on Wednesday ensuring they finished 25th in the group phase of Europe’a elite competition, and will therefore play no further part.",
      "The club’s sporting director, Medhi Benatia, pulled no punches with his words post-match, though he seemed to direct his ire at the players rather than De Zerbi.",
      "He said: “I hope that the players are aware that tonight is a professional foul. I’ve lost games in my career, I’ve rarely felt that sense of shame, being able to concede six goals in two games. I want it to have consequences on the rest of the season.”",
      "It was reported by RMC Sport on Thursday morning that Marseille chiefs were considering sacking the Italian boss, who’s reportedly on Manchester United’s list of potential candidates to take permanent charge of the Red Devils at the end of the season.",
      "Questions were asked when De Zerbi didn’t take charge of Marseille training on Thursday, and later in the day it was reported by Foot Mercato that the 46-year-old has offered to walk away.",
      "It’s been claimed that talks are said to have taken place between all parties, with a formal announcement on what happens next expected to be made shortly.",
      "French football journalist Julian Laurens said he was “not surprised” by the news of De Zerbi’s imminent departure.",
      "“It was his failure very much because he could not motivate the team, it was the 30th game this season with a 30th different lineup in the starting XI.",
      "“He never really found the solution. They were beaten far too easily by Liverpool last week at home and that is what cost them – and I am not surprised because things were not going right.”",
      "Marseille sit third in Ligue 1, seven points of league-leaders Paris Saint-Germain, and Laurens claims the former Brighton boss has been “at war with the French media” through some difficult times.",
      "“It is difficult, he has been at war with the French media for a long time now, really clashing pretty much every press conference, every week,” he added.",
      "“We know how emotional he gets and how emotional he is, and I think sometimes maybe it will come back onto decisions like tonight, but it sounds like a very De Zerbi kind of reaction.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand reckons Man Utd need to hire one of two “lunatics” as their next permanent boss after the Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim last week.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly performed a U-turn on Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, who is ‘no longer the favourite’ to replace Michael Carrick.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils should attempt to sign Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi as Ruben Amorim’s successor.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi will definitely be considered for the permanent Man Utd job in the summer.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have a ‘contingency plan’ regarding their head coach situation as they have four managers on their ‘exciting shortlist’.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur’s decision on whether to sack head coach Thomas Frank will be determined by one ‘pivotal’ factor."

      "After a tremendously fun Big Midweek of UEFAball it’s back to the bread and butter of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "But don’t worry, it’s still big. Very big. And a lot of that’s down to the fact we’ve got Spurs v Man City to enjoy. There are few more reliable fixtures for some kind of nonsense or other, and Spurs – the 14th best team in England but the fourth best in all of Europe – are currently in the mood for delivering piping hot nonsense at frankly dangerous levels.",
      "Liverpool, too, would quite like to add some of their continental brio to their domestic offerings, while DNA-powered Man United reviver Michael Carrick must now prove he can do it in the non-blockbuster Sunday 2pm slot.",
      "",
      "You know what’s going to happen, don’t you? We know it, you know it, Pep Guardiola knows it. Thomas Frank probably doesn’t know it, but he doesn’t know much of anything these days.",
      "But yes, obviously, Spurs are obviously going to win this game. Rarely if ever has the fundamental paradox of Tottenham-City games applied more than it does here, to wit: the less likely a Tottenham win logically appears to be, the more likely it is to happen.",
      "And right now a Tottenham win in any game – obviously this only applies to any game of proper football in a difficult competition, not tish and fipsy like the Champions League – is a highly illogical outcome.",
      "Spurs have just come through the gentlest imaginable run of fixtures, a January of almost cartoonish ease with which to get themselves back into contention for the European spots, and somehow come out the other side of it in the heat of a proper relegation battle having won not a single one of their last five Premier League games. They’ve lost back-to-back against two teams whose winless Premier League runs extended to double figures before their appointment with the good doctor, and coming minutes away from making that three on the bounce at Burnley.",
      "Meanwhile they’ve been casually winning games in Europe like it’s nothing. In the last three months, Spurs have now won twice as many Champions League games (4) as they have Premier League ones (2).",
      "A team that now, as an apparent point of principle, insists upon conceding at least two stupid and easily preventable goals in every single Premier League match they play has kept more clean sheets in the Champions League than anyone else.",
      "This is Spurs heritage. This is what they do. Spursy has never been purely about the spectacular ability for the disastrous and humiliating; it has always required the ability to occasionally and often entirely inexplicably hit absurd heights to make the pratfalls so much bigger and funnier.",
      "And for many years now, Man City have been a key punching bag along the way in the set-up for whatever nonsense Spurs are building up to. While for the last couple of seasons Spurs have perfected this wonderful new bit of being a clinical force in Europe but worse than ever before domestically, they’ve quite rightly never abandoned the ever-bankable ‘improbable victory over Pep Guardiola’s Man City’ bit.",
      "They’ve won their last two trips to the Etihad 4-0 and 2-0, and also knocked City out of the Carabao last season.",
      "This latest instalment is unfortunately at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Burnley and Brentford remain the only Premier League teams this season to leave empty-handed, but does come with added banter potential from not just Spurs’ own stupid form but the fact last weekend’s results have got City right back on Arsenal’s coat-tails in the title race.",
      "It’s still a bit early in the season for it to become a true repeat of the great 23/24 final-week showpiece, especially with Spurs so uncomfortably close to the bottom three. But it is nevertheless a game that has either a win-win or lose-lose element to it for Spurs, depending on your outlook.",
      "And it gives us the latest chance to wheel out one of our very favourite stats. Since Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018/19, Spurs have taken 18 points from their 15 Premier League games against them. Over that exact time period, Spurs have 23 points from 15 Premier League games against Man City.",
      "Now we know Wolves were quite good for some of that time, but for a lot of that time City were the most relentless collector of Premier League points Our League has ever known. Yet Spurs hold a 7-6 winning record against them over a time period that includes only the very last not-very-good-actually bits of the Pochettino era and all the awful crud that’s followed. And we’ve not even mentioned the infamous Champions League quarter-final.",
      "We have no idea why it keeps happening as often as it does, but we can only assume it will keep happening for as long as Spurs remain so resolutely, utterly and determinedly Spurs.",
      "",
      "Spurs aren’t the only team using the Champions League to mask their domestic failings, with Liverpool managing to even finish above the all-conquering European night Lilywhites after thrashing Qarabag to finish third in the standings and achieve some level of cathartic release after the loss of the most misleading unbeaten run on record with that late defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "And like Spurs, Liverpool now face a tricky game in which to try and port some of that European feel-good vibe to a misfiring Premier League campaign.",
      "They’re not exactly the same, sure. Liverpool are trying to win an undignified scrap for the Champions League placings and Spurs are trying not to get actually relegated, but the point stands.",
      "Newcastle are Saturday night’s opponents for Arne Slot. The lowliest of the English teams in the Champions League having finished all the way down in a perfectly decent 12th, and it’s fair to say that they used up a bit more gas in battling gamely if in the end not that meaningfully to a 1-1 draw against the holders PSG on Wednesday night.",
      "It was a result that left both of them outside the top eight, and burdens Newcastle with another couple of games in a crucial month as they now try to avoid finishing outside the top five in England.",
      "",
      "Unai Emery may be rueing his decision to start Ollie Watkins in a broadly meaningless final game of the Europa League league phase after Villa’s star striker limped off in the first half with what looked like a hamstring issue.",
      "But things would be a sight worse if they hadn’t managed to tie up a deal to bring Tammy Abraham back to Villa Park. It’s a rather neat marker of Villa’s rise that Abraham’s season at Villa Park in 2018/19 involved scoring 25 goals to get them out of the Championship, and he will have rather different targets for the remainder of this campaign.",
      "Watkins’ injury makes Abraham potentially an even more important signing even more quickly for a team whose sheer lack of alternatives goes some way to explaining why Watkins was being used in such a low-wattage game in the first place.",
      "Abraham will now, we assume, be thrust straight into the action and charged with the small matter of instantly providing the goals to keep Aston Villa’s title challenge going. Best of luck, Tammy.",
      "",
      "The wins over City and Arsenal were extraordinary and thrilling. But the reality is that even at their lowest ebbs United have, under all their various failures of post-Fergie managers, quite often managed to summon up sufficient muscle memory to give the teams that used to be their direct rivals a rare old game.",
      "Even under Amorim they would sometimes take points off your Citys or your Arsenals or the Liverpools of this world.",
      "What United have been less good at, particularly in the Ten Hag and Amorim eras, is reliably sorting out the vast glut of decent mid-table teams that you get in your modern Premier League now.",
      "As such, and as dreary yet contrarian as it feels to say it, what we see from Carrick and his side this weekend against Fulham may well tell us more about his and their long-term prospects than the magnificent and attention-grabbing nonsense we’ve had so far.",
      "",
      "Wrexham’s march through the divisions may not yet be done as they launch an improbable bid for the play-offs in the Championship, the division that was supposed to bring Hollywood FC back to reality.",
      "No escape from reality for Sheffield Wednesday, who remain seven points away even from being able to end the season where everyone else began it.",
      "",
      "The European champions are still operating some way short of their brilliant continent-conquering best this season.

      "With all six English teams in this season’s Champions League reaching the knockout stages – and five of the six finishing in the top eight to proceed directly to the last 16 – it now looks certain England will once again receive a bonus spot in next year’s competition.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season are all still involved as we head into the play-offs and last 16. Every other country has by now lost at least one of their teams.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals, all of whom have now started losing teams from their own equations while England power on with a full quota.",
      "With English teams securing five of the eight automatic spots in the last 16 of the Champions League via first, third, fourth, sixth and eighth-place finishes, England have pocketed a huge haul of final-position bonus points to further extend their lead here. Even play-off-bound Newcastle have added plenty more points to the kitty for finishing 12th.",
      "Aston Villa finished second in the Europa League standings for another huge bonus-point boost, with Nottingham Forest safely into the play-offs from 13th. Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. With all nine teams still standing, England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "We only have a year’s worth of data under the current format to go on, but worth noting that third-placed Italy finished with 21.875 last year, which means England are already only about a point away from a total that would have been enough for a top-two finish last time out.",

      "Unlikely to hold off the big leagues currently behind them, but Porto and Braga both finishing in the top six of the Europa League standings with Sporting seventh in the Champions League has thrown a good chunk of bonus points into the pot – and any points Portuguese teams rack up only have to be divided by five.",

      "Gary Neville has criticised Ruben Amorim’s treatment of Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, stating that the ex-Red Devils boss “killed him” with one decision.",
      "Mainoo only started 16 times under Amorim during his 14-month reign as head coach.",
      "He played 40 times in total but was competing for a starting spot with Bruno Fernandes, which Amorim stated publicly, all but confirming that he would never play.",
      "Manchester United legend Neville has singled out the decision to say Mainoo is fighting for Fernandes’ place, claiming that the Portuguese coach publicly “killed” the 20-year-old.",
      "“I must admit, I never liked the handling of Mainoo,” Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast. “I think we talked about that a lot on this show. I never liked the handling of that.",
      "“When he (Ruben) said at the start of the season that it was him or Bruno [Fernandes], I never agreed with that. It killed him. It killed him publicly. And then he never put him in the team at all, apart from Grimsby.”",

      "Neville added that Mainoo’s performances in Michael Carrick’s two games proved that Amorim was wrong to freeze out the England midfielder.",
      "“When you watch Kobbie now in the two games, that was nearly pushing a talented player out of the club before he’d even really had a chance to perform,” he continued. “You look at him now in these two matches.”",

      "Darren Fletcher took caretaker charge of two United matches following Amorim’s dismissal and was replaced by Carrick until the end of the season.",
      "Fletcher immediately decided to reinstate Mainoo to the starting line-up and those minutes set him in good stead to thrive in Carrick’s opening two fixtures, wins against the Premier League’s top two, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Mainoo played the full 90 minutes in both matches, partnering Casemiro in a deeper role, with Fernandes as a No.10 behind Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He provided the assist for Matheus Cunha’s winner at Arsenal on Sunday and already looks back to his very best, which is also a significant boost for England ahead of this summer’s World Cup.",
      "When Mainoo broke into the United team under Erik ten Hag, he was only 18 years old, and less than eight months later, he was starting in the European Championship final for his country.",
      "Mainoo made his England debut in March 2024 in a friendly against Brazil at Wembley, and he featured in six of the Three Lions’ seven Euro 2024 matches, including the final defeat to Spain.",
      "He has not played under current head coach Thomas Tuchel, who replaced previous manager Gareth Southgate, but if he stays fit and maintains this level of performance, he should be included in the German’s squad for the March friendlies against Uruguay and Japan.",

      "Ian Wright has questioned why Man Utd legend Gary Neville has insisted that Michael Carrick “shouldn’t get” the permanent job at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick was given the interim role as head coach until the end of the season at Man Utd after the Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim earlier this month.",
      "Man Utd then plan on appointing a new permanent manager in the summer with many top managers likely to be out of work after the season and World Cup.",

      "Man Utd have beaten arch-rivals Man City 2-0 and Premier League leaders Arsenal 3-2 in Carrick’s first two matches with his next test coming against Fulham at the weekend.",
      "Carrick has led Man Utd into fourth place in the Premier League, which would guarantee the Red Devils a place in next season’s Champions League if they were to finish there, but Man Utd legend Neville doesn’t think they should offer him the permanent role.",
      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Michael shouldn’t get the job at the end of the season, in my opinion. And I’m saying this really unemotionally, right?",
      "“It’s nothing to do with what two weeks ago, where to be fair, I agree with Roy, that no one would have mentioned Michael for the job, right? If you’re going to earn your stripes and manage one of the biggest clubs in the world and handle the pressure that’s going to be thrown at you, I think you have to have that years of experience personally.”",
      "In response, frustrated Arsenal legend Wright replied: “So why did Manchester United give it to Amorim? I’m not having that.",
      "“If he goes in now and he’s proving that he can do it, off the back of this result, what are you talking about?”",
      "“He should get the opportunity to see if he can do it. If you’ve given it to Amorim.”",
      "Surprisingly, another Man Utd legend Roy Keane insisted that the Red Devils should give him the job after claiming over the weekend that they shouldn’t appoint Carrick.",
      "Keane said: “I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.”",
      "Seemingly ready to point out Keane’s previous opposition to giving Carrick the permanent job, Neville said: “You said the other day, Roy…” but Keane across him and added: “I don’t think it’s the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "“Yeah, but, I’m sticking to my guns. I’ve said my piece, I think that he’s got the job, and then if he gets it in the summer then you go; ‘Listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it’s a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "“I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he’s doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn’t get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "“But just cause you’re doing well at United, it doesn’t mean he’ll do well at another club. He’s got the players back, it’s all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he’s took advantage of it.”",
      "Neville doesn’t believe Arteta will give Eze the “freedom” to express himself at Arsenal despite his insistence to the contrary.",
      "Spurs haven’t won in five Premier League games so we all know what they’re about to do to Manchester City, while the Michael Carrick era properly begins.",
      "Gary Neville has called on Arsenal to show their title-winning mentality, while Ian Wright fears the Gunners’ season could “peter out”.",
      "Gary Neville admits he is “absolutely startled” after Michael Carrick won his opening two games as interim Manchester United manager.",
      "It turns out Manchester United chiefs are actually pretty good at transfers, and a veto of a Michael Carrick request will be another win…",

      "Chelsea have reportedly put a price tag on Cole Palmer amid speculation that he could move to Man Utd in the summer transfer window.",
      "Since joining Chelsea in a bargain £40m deal from Man City in 2023, Palmer has contributed 41 goals and 19 assists in 82 Premier League appearances.",
      "Those figures have attracted attention of the biggest clubs in world football but Palmer has had a quieter year, missing half their games through injury.",
      "Despite only playing 14 times this season, there are rumours that Man Utd are looking to make a move for the Chelsea superstar in the summer.",
      "There were rumours last week that he is ‘unsettled’ at Stamford Bridge and that Palmer would consider leaving Chelsea for Man City if Pep Guardiola leaves in the summer.",
      "However, a fresh report on Monday indicated that Palmer ‘would be open to a sensational transfer to Manchester United’ in the summer with the Chelsea attacker ‘missing his hometown of Wythenshawe’.",
      "READ: No Man Utd players but two transfer targets in top 10 for passing under pressure",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on Thursday that Palmer is a ‘key part of the project’ at Stamford Bridge and that he has ‘got zero coming’ out of the Chelsea star’s camp about a potential move.",
      "There has already been talk of a potential offer worth as much as €120m (£104m) but Spanish website Fichajes insists that Chelsea have ‘set his release clause at €200m (£173m), a figure that clearly demonstrates their intention to secure their star player’.",
      "Chelsea ‘are not facing financial difficulties that would force them to sell’ and they believe the €120m mentioned elsewhere ‘falls far short of Palmer’s true value’.",

      "Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Champions League Debrief podcast, Osman said: “I felt like Chelsea would go to Napoli and win and get that statement result. Napoli are struggling with numbers and injuries but you got the feeling that Chelsea weren’t just there to limp through.",
      "“Tactically they were a little bit poor in the first half but Liam Rosenior made a good change in the second half with Cole Palmer as he was then able to join up with Joao Pedro.",
      "“It brought Joao Pedro to life and allowed him to make runs so Chelsea grew in strength. The longer the game went on, the more you felt like Chelsea would end up winning it.",

      "It turns out Manchester United chiefs are actually pretty good at transfers, and a veto of a Michael Carrick request will be another win…",
      "It has long been the perception about Man Utd that they have been very poor at transfers since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, and this is true to a certain degree.",
      "Man Utd have got a lot wrong in the transfer market, but there has been a turning of the tide since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team took over.",
      "Ratcliffe and co. have been far from perfect regarding other matters (i.e., with his brutal cost-cutting programme), but they have been pretty on the money with transfers.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is their only potential blot on their summer recruitment, while the doubts about the January 2025 signing of Patrick Dorgu have started to evaporate as he has thrived in an advanced role.",
      "And even better work has been done on outgoings: In the summer, Tyrell Malacia was their only ‘bomb squad’ member to stick around, with Man Utd managing to offload Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund on their teams with significant fees secured in all but one of these deals (Sancho is out of contract in the summer and will inevitably leave on a free transfer).",
      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "This business enabled Man Utd to invest £230m on signings last summer, and they are well-placed to be in a position to spend even more in this summer’s window as cash will come in via the sales of Rashford and Hojlund, while they could also benefit from Mason Greenwood’s sell-on clause and Champions League qualification.",
      "United’s wage bill will be further boosted by the exit of Casemiro, who is confirmed to be leaving upon the expiry of his contract instead of accepting a pay cut to remain at the club.",
      "And the Red Devils also look to be going this correct route with Harry Maguire, who finds himself in the same boat as Casemiro in terms of contract.",
      "Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reporter Nathan Salt explained why Maguire is ‘increasingly unlikely’ to remain at Man Utd despite Carrick’s admiration of the England international.",
      "“He’s played well in the past two games – winning the man-of-the-match award at Arsenal – but it feels increasingly unlikely,” Salt said.",
      "“United have had ample opportunity to get Maguire on to fresh terms but there appears to be limited willingness at this stage to do so with his contract now around five months from expiry.",
      "“Carrick is a fan of Maguire but senior United figures are keen to see next season’s minutes go to Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, two young players that United believe will be the bedrock of the backline for years to come.”",
      "The Athletic’s Andy Mitten has since added that ‘Maguire’s future will likely boil down to money and the length of the contract being offered’, while he ‘needs to be playing every week and United’s view is that if he’s doing that, the case for a new contract is a much stronger one’.",
      "But the reality is that Maguire is unlikely to retain his current importance for much longer.",
      "Like Carrick, Maguire has benefited from circumstance, returning to fitness and form at a time when Man Utd are on a rare upswing and while Matthijs de Ligt is unavailable.",
      "Maguire has been really good for Man Utd in their last two games, but he is still unlikely to be ahead of De Ligt in the pecking order once Carrick (or his successor) has a fully fit squad, while Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are also there to replace him.",
      "Had Casemiro signed a cut-price extension to remain at Man Utd, his wage would still have been among the highest in the squad and it would have been difficult to justify when he would have been a bit-part player behind Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson next season.",
      "And with INEOS setting a precedent regarding how they will handle ageing players and their expiring contracts, it should be expected that Maguire follows Casemiro out of the door for a new adventure with his head held high.",
      "This would be the right step for all parties and another move in the right direction for INEOS.",
      "Spurs haven’t won in five Premier League games so we all know what they’re about to do to Manchester City, while the Michael Carrick era properly begins.",

      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann has urged the Reds to consider a move for the Man Utd defender, with a Bundesliga star among two alternatives.",
      "Man Utd are set to reject any request from Michael Carrick to renew Harry Maguire’s contract as they look to the future, according to reports.",

      "Unfortunately the last actual update on that was Liam Rosenior saying ‘LOL no’ (we’re paraphrasing, obviously; just imagine ‘LOL no’ but about 873 per cent more LinkedIn) and that’s no use at all.",

      "“Players like Palmer sometimes want to move on and experience something else. Maybe he’s bored or unhappy with the system at Chelsea – he hasn’t seemed himself this season.",
      "“I’d however like to see him stay there because they’ve put a lot of faith in him when other clubs didn’t. There comes a point where he should ask himself: ‘Chelsea have helped me a lot, can I help them before I potentially leave and go somewhere else?'”",

      "“If you’re talking about signing a top midfield player to sit in Manchester United’s midfield, the range of cost is clearly £80-100m, which has with it £20m of amortisation cost per annum,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“It’s one step forward cutting yourself off from a very high cost of an older player, but Casemiro has to be replaced and there’s lots of risk with all of these acquisitions.",
      "“Manchester United in particular have recruited in midfield many players where it hasn’t worked, and then you’re stuck with a very high cost that’s very hard to move. I mean, Ugarte is a perfect example. Again, you just have to see how it pans out.”",

      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16 last season.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 17:18, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."
