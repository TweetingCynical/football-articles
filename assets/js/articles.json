      "Alvaro Carreras continues to receive praise from Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso as the former Manchester United player's transfer market value soars. Carreras was a United player from 2020 until 2024 after joining their academy from Madrid's.",
      "The left-back never featured in a first-team match for the Red Devils and was sent on loan to Preston North End and Granada before a subsequent stint at Benfica rejuvenated his career. Following an impressive half-season in Portugal, Carreras joined them on a permanent deal in the summer of 2024 for €6m plus a potential €3m in add-ons (£7.8m).",
      "His maiden full campaign in Portugal turned out to be a success and Real decided to act swiftly and secured the full-back's services. Now returned to the Spanish capital, Carreras has been making his mark and Alonso cannot resist lauding the former United player.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising; it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras hasn't missed a single minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season, and that form has resulted in his value skyrocketing.",
      "Transfermarkt values Carreras at £31million after being snapped up by Real for £38million in the summer. Meanwhile, United's ever-present full-back Diogo Dalot is only worth £26million in the current market.",
      "That is the same as Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee. As for Patrick Dorgu, signed by Ruben Amorim as the first choice for the left flank, he is currently valued at £22million, the same as Noussair Mazraoui. After Carreras' summer move to Madrid, United did manage to pocket an extra £7.5m due to their sell-on clause, but they might end up ruing his sale.",

      "Marcus Rashford has shown solidarity with ex-Manchester United team-mate Jadon Sancho after the latter's difficult league debut for Aston Villa. Rashford is on loan at Barcelona having left Old Trafford in July.",
      "He had endured a difficult start to life in Catalunya with some members of the Spanish press claiming the European powerhouses were going to try and cancel his loan, reports which were soon rejected by the club. After his brace in their 2-1 away victory over Newcastle United in the Champions League, it looked as if Rashford was beginning to settle.",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, made his first Premier League appearance for Villa at the weekend. The duo have maintained their friendship from their time together at United and England, which have both had many difficult moments.",
      "Last season, Sancho stirred up controversy among United fans when he announced Rashford was now 'free' after moving to Villa on loan. Rashford's stint at Villa Park rejuvenated the 27-year-old and his performances were enough to convince Barcelona to take a chance on him this season.",
      "Villa did not take up the option to sign him permanently, meaning Rashford and Sancho found themselves in the so-called Red Devils' 'Bomb Squad' after being deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho could have made a permanent move to Chelsea at the end of last season, but he returned to Old Trafford after failing to agree on wages with Enzo Maresca's team. It's rumoured the ex-Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund player reached out to Rashford about a potential move to Villa, who offered a glowing endorsement.",
      "On Sunday, Sancho made his first appearance for Villa in the Premier League, but it didn't go as planned. Unai Emery's side couldn't overcome 10-man Sunderland at the Stadium of Light, drawing 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on the recent match, Sancho uploaded a photo of him playing for Villa with the caption: \"Unfortunate not to get the win over the weekend, head up and go again to make things right!\"",
      "Rashford was quick to show his support to his former team-mate, responding with a red heart emoji to the winger's message.",
      "While Sancho is finding his feet at Villa Park, Rashford is experiencing ups and downs of his own. His brace in his Champions League debut for the club was a huge statement, particularly with Lamine Yamal currently nursing an injury.",
      "He was then dropped for Barcelona's next match against Getafe by Hansi Flick after reporting late for a team meeting before the clash. He made up for his poor time-keeping by helping create their crucial third goal in a 3-0 victory.",
      "Rashford has two goals and one assist in six appearances for Barcelona. He will be eying even more when his side travel to face Oviedo in their next match on Thursday, before they play host to Real Sociedad on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United have some time to rest ahead of their trip to Brentford at the weekend with no European or Carabao Cup action. It means Ruben Amorim will have a full week to prepare for the Premier League clash.",
      "United beat Chelsea last time out thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, with the latter also receiving a red card on the stroke of half-time.",
      "United could end up being referred to the Premier League for an investigation after Maguire decided to interfere with the multiball protocol after his substitution against Chelsea. Footage has emerged of the defender departing the Old Trafford pitch after being taken off, and kicking a ball off one of the cones to send it to rolling towards the home crowd.",
      "Technically, Maguire broke one of the Premier League rules by doing this, as the rules state that not interfering with the system is crucial to \"ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "The rule also reads: \"Participants (including but not limited to players, substitutes, occupants of the technical area or any other club personnel) must not interfere with the multiball system, the match ball or the replacement balls at any time.",
      "\"Any failure to follow the multiball protocol will be referred to the Premier League for further investigation and possible regulatory action under the Premier League rules.\"",
      "It is unclear if the footage has been sent to the league's hierarchy or if Maguire has been spoken to.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Sesko to follow in Ruud van Nistelrooy's footsteps at United's training ground and storm off if he continues to receive poor service in front of goal.",
      "The Slovenian striker is yet to find the net for the Red Devils in the Premier League, making five appearances. Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the ex-United defender criticsed Sesko's performances, saying: \"In the first half, against 10 men, he's had six touches. Six touches! I think the responsibility goes to the striker as well [as other players].",
      "\"In today's game there's enough at your disposal technology-wise and clip-wise that you can get it in black and white on the iPad and say to your team-mates, 'You know when you got in that position, look where I am.'\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to highlight how Van Nistelrooy once stormed off the training pitch when he became frustrated with Cristiano Ronaldo's lack of service from the wings - much like Sesko could be feeling with Amad's current form out wide.",
      "He added: \"It's decision making in the final third that's going to set him free or it isn't, and he's got to try and dictate to a lot of those players either through runs that make it so obvious or physically telling them after a game.",
      "\"They're the type of conversations he has to have because I know Ruud [van Nistelrooy] was having that.",
      "\"I saw Ruud van Nistelrooy walk off the training field because Ronaldo did too many step overs and he wasn't playing it when he wanted it. You've got to find it from somewhere to make your team-mates know, and that will be the making of him.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford is lighting it up in La Liga and the Champions League for Barcelona - and the Catalan giants may be tempted to make his loan move permanent.",
      "Currently, United value the forward at £35million and have no recall clause in his contract; meaning that the 27-year-old will spend his entire 2025/26 season in Spain if all goes well.",
      "However, Barca are hoping to make this loan switch a permanent one and believe they can secure the England international's services for just £26m. While Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be keen to let Rashford leave on the cheap, the boyhood United fan doesn't see a way back at his old club even if he does well abroad.",
      "While Barcelona and United continue to hash out a potential permanent fee for the experienced attacker, Rashford will continue to let his football do the talking as he prepares for a big season and summer ahead.",
      "Matheus Cunha made a return to the United squad on Saturday against Chelsea, coming on as a substitution in the 64th minute for Noussair Mazraoui. However, there are few other injury returns on the way, with Lisandro Martinez remaining unavailable for Amorim.",
      "Diogo Dalot, on the other hand, had been sidelined with a muscle injury that has kept him ruled out for both United and Portugal. However, United confirmed on Tuesday that the defender has returned to training ahead of the clash with Brentford, and may be in contention to return to the matchday squad.",
      "Meanwhile, Martinez has been recovering from a knee injury that occurred last season, which forced the defender to undergo surgery in February.",
      "Since then, the centre-half has returned to training and is building up fitness ahead of a return to Amorim's line-up. No return date has been given at this time, although it looks like Martinez can't be far off of joining up with the rest of his teammates on matchday - even from the bench.",
      "Casemiro is now also unavailable for United, though it is through suspension rather than injury. The Brazilian was sent off during United's win over Chelsea, meaning he will miss the trip to Brentford at the weekend.",
      "He could return to the matchday squad for United's fixture against Sunderland early next month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Garnacho, 21, was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge all summer after being informed he had no future at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim towards the end of the 2024-25 campaign. He didn't become a Blue until late in the summer transfer window, though, swapping Manchester for London in a £40million switch.",
      "The Argentina international was handed his first Chelsea start by Enzo Maresca in Tuesday night's meeting with Lincoln after failing to come off the bench in the Blues' 2-1 loss away at United on Saturday - and he did not receive a warm welcome by the Imps, whose fans also serenaded him with a chant of \"You're f***ing s***\" when he was substituted on the hour mark.",
      "Prior to that, Garnacho's every touch was booed by home fans at the LNER Stadium as Lincoln fought to pull off one of the biggest cup shocks of the season. And as Garnacho struggled to make an impression in the first half, Lincoln hit the front through Rob Street following a defensive mix-up from the visitors.",
      "Some gleeful Manchester United fans revelled in seeing him fail to impress against League One opposition. One fan wrote on social media: \"Garnacho is being substituted against Lincoln. Yeah! We weren't the problem.\"",
      "Others were quick to point out the attacker had struggled to register a goal contribution in his three appearances for Chelsea so far, with plenty posting \"003\". Another fan wrote: This Garnacho downfall … lol. He made the worst decision joining Chelsea!\"",
      "Fortunately for Garnacho and Chelsea, they spared their blushes with a second half rally as quickfire goals from Tyrique George and Facundo Buonanotte helped turn the game on its head shortly before Garnacho was withdrawn.",
      "Garnacho's early withdrawal was likely due to his lack of action in pre-season for Manchester United after it became clear he would be leaving the club. The winger will be hoping to build on his first Blues start at the weekend when Chelsea host Brighton at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Complications from ankle surgery and the subsequent infection means Rangnick will now remain in hospital for an extended period. He initially underwent ankle surgery in June but was forced to undergo an emergency operation due to complications in July. His ankle issues saw him undergo another operation last week, with Bild saying Rangnick's infection is the 'serious reason' behind his extended stay in hospital.",

      "Manchester United have reached out to offer Amad support after he was on the receiving end of online abuse over the weekend. Amad deleted all his Instagram posts after United fans criticised his decision to share a photo of himself with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The United winger posted a photo of himself posing with Garnacho's Chelsea shirt alongside his former team-mate, who was holding up his United shirt. The meeting between the two came after United beat Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "Although he didn't get onto the pitch after Robert Sanchez's early red card for Chelsea, it was Garnacho's first trip back to his former club following a £40million transfer in the summer. Amad is friends with the Argentina international, who is also represented by the same agency, but the post did not go down well with fans.",
      "The 23-year-old was abused by some supporters and reacted by deleting all his Instagram posts and all but one of his posts on X. The Sun reports that United checked on him on Monday and offered support.",
      "Despite his reaction to the backlash, Amad is understood to be okay. After playing the full 90 minutes against Chelsea, he will be hoping to keep his place in the side for when United travel to face Brentford in the league on Saturday.",
      "United have a full week to prepare for the trip to west London, having already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup. While most Premier League sides are involved in the third round competition in midweek, United were beaten on penalties by Grimsby Town in the second round in August.",
      "Amad has featured in all six of their matches so far this season, starting all but one fixture. He has so far contributed just one assist for the struggling side, who sit 11th in the Premier League following their second win of the campaign on the weekend.",
      "Garnacho left United under a cloud in the summer after falling out with Amorim in the final few games of last season. The 21-year-old was told he had no future at the club and became a part of the 'bomb squad', forced to train with fellow exiles Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Garnacho was only made two brief substitute appearances for Chelsea so far, against Brentford and Bayern Munich, and stayed on the bench at Old Trafford following Sanchez's early red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson was known for his strict discipline, and it seems that even video games on the team bus weren't safe from his wrath. The insight comes from former Red Devil Paul Scholes, who shared the anecdote on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and fellow ex-United star Nicky Butt.",
      "The conversation started when McGuinness mentioned a tale told by Old Trafford icon Wayne Rooney. The club's record goal scorer suggested that part of United's incredible success during his time at the club was due to the bonds formed while playing video games on the team coach.",
      "A number of United players, including Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea and Wes Brown, would participate in sessions of SOCOM on the PlayStation Portable.",
      "However, despite Rooney's assertions, these gaming gatherings didn't sit well with Sir Alex, who was famed for his iron-fisted leadership.",
      "When quizzed about Rooney's comments, Scholes said: \"I didn't play those games, it was more the younger lads in the group.",
      "\"The PSP (the PlayStation Portable) and SOCOM, and I can hear them all f*****g shouting from the back of the bus, and it's sort some of shooting game, a war game, and it's all you could hear and it was f*****g annoying.\"",
      "McGuinness chimed in, asserting that bus journeys to and from matches were usually filled with card games rather than video games.",
      "Scholes added: \"I do remember the boss going down the back of the bus saying, 'Shut the f**k up - because they're all shouting at each other, 'We're on our way to Arsenal away here, what's wrong with you?'\".",
      "However, he did admit that there might have been some camaraderie benefits from the group gaming, saying: \"Sometimes it's quite funny as they are having a right go at each other at the back and there is a bit of camaraderie and it's a team game as well.\"",
      "\"I really believe a big part of our success was playing on the PSP,\" said Rooney. \"It got us communicating more - we used to play it on the plane, on the team bus.",
      "\"It would be me, Rio [Ferdinand], Michael Carrick, John O'Shea, Wes Brown. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go and revive people when they get killed and it was a massive part of our success - ask any of those players, it was brilliant.\"",

      "Manchester United demonstrated this summer that there are times when a sale is necessary, regardless of whether the deal is ideal for the club or not. Alejandro Garnacho had to be sold in the last transfer window as his relationship with the club was causing more harm than good.",
      "Marcus Rashford was a similar case, albeit to a lesser extent as it seemed he may not have completely severed all ties, but based on the evidence, it was still right to let him go. In retrospect, the Reds made a terrible mistake in letting Scott McTominay leave the football club.",
      "Like Garnacho and Rashford, United profited from the deal, making the books look healthier once he departed for Napoli. However, unlike his former teammates, McTominay was not a problem at United.",
      "His previous manager Erik ten Hag even expressed regret at letting the Scottish international go. Ten Hag hastily decided that he needed to bolster defensive midfield but instead of trying to offload Casemiro, who remains one of the highest paid players at the club, he sold an asset who is now taking the football world by storm.",
      "Remarkably, in his first season in Serie A, McTominay managed to flourish more than anyone anticipated. His tally of 12 goals and six assists marked the best season of his professional career, proving instrumental in Antonio Conte's side clinching the Serie A title.",
      "However, his redemption arc was only fully realised on Monday night when he ranked 18th in the Ballon d'Or standings, ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Florian Wirtz. And let's not forget, there wasn't a single United player to be found anywhere near the Top 30.",
      "At the time, the decision to sell McTominay seemed like a short-term move that hadn't been thoroughly thought through. While no one could have predicted his sensational season in Italy, the 28-year-old's story should serve as a warning for United's future decisions.",
      "History already seems set to repeat itself under Ruben Amorim, with Kobbie Mainoo's future looking increasingly uncertain. He requested a loan move in the summer, which was rejected, and so far, there's little indication that United will be able to satisfy his concerns before the January transfer window opens.",
      "If Mainoo were to 'do a McTominay', he would be better positioned to succeed given his younger age and less inconsistent form at Old Trafford. Failing to address Mainoo's concerns though could once again lead United to make a short-term decision that ultimately hampers the club's long-term progression.",
      "Mainoo is keen to remain with United, which is why he only requested a loan move. However, the rigid adherence to captain Bruno Fernandes could push him towards a permanent exit.",
      "Fernandes' contribution to the team is undeniable, but there's a real chance he could depart next summer. If Mainoo has already been forced out by then, United could find themselves in a tricky situation where they have to replace both men.",
      "Amorim needs to start grooming Mainoo now to be Fernandes' successor. It's clear that he has the talent for it, and United is a club known for giving young players a chance.",
      "If United are to learn anything from McTominay's success, it should be that sometimes it's better to nurture the next generation from within rather than selling them off for quick cash. If Mainoo does leave, it would demonstrate that the Reds haven't learned their lesson, at all.",

      "The 23-year-old has already made his presence known on the bench during the Manchester derby, but head coach Ruben Amorim insists there's no guaranteed number one keeper in his squad. \"No, nobody has a place that is his place,\" he responded when quizzed about whether Bayindir was his first choice following Andre Onana's loan move to Trabzonspor.",

      "Chelsea attempted to snap him up in the summer with a £12million bid, falling short of Milan's £21million asking price. It's understood that United bigwigs have recently been in talks with Maignan's representatives, who also manage £65million summer signing Bryan Mbeumo.",

The on-loan Manchester United forward began last week brilliantly with a spectacular two-goal display for the La Liga club away to Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "But the 27-year-old found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench for Barcelona's 3-0 victory over Getafe on Sunday after widespread reports in Spain claimed he arrived two minutes late to a team briefing. Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now cautioned Rashford that his conduct is \"not good enough\" whilst supporting Barca boss Hansi Flick's uncompromising stance on punctuality.",
      "It follows the Mirror reporting that the two clubs remain significantly apart regarding an agreement on the transfer fee needed to make the England international's loan switch permanent. Barcelona are believed to be eager to sign Rashford at a knockdown price of £26million, whilst United are hoping to secure closer to £35m for their academy product.",
      "Foster voiced his frustration over Rashford's latest indiscretion, despite lauding him for recapturing his best form in the Newcastle clash.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Rashford got a couple of goals, it was a fantastic performance and he just looked proper. It was old school Marcus Rashford and we love to see it.",
      "\"Then he goes and gets dropped at the weekend because he was late for a team stretching session on the morning of a game. The way that Barcelona have dealt with it, you can tell Hansi Flick doesn't take any s***.\"",
      "Foster later added: \"It's disrespectful and I understand people going, 'Oh, he's [only] a minute or two late,' but it doesn't matter. There are 29 other people there who are waiting for you. If you can't get the basics right, then it's not good enough.\"",
      "Rashford isn't the only player to fall foul of Flick's strict discipline code, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and most recently Raphinha all facing sanctions for similar infractions. Rashford was expected to start the Getafe clash on the left flank of Barcelona's attack, but Ferran Torres was selected in his place.",
      "Despite being left out, he displayed no visible signs of annoyance and entered the fray to replace Raphinha at the interval. Rashford shone on the right wing, setting up Dani Olmo's decisive third goal that sealed victory.",
      "Rashford is spending the campaign on loan at Barca after falling out with United boss Ruben Amorim. He spent the latter half of last term on loan at Aston Villa before switching to the Nou Camp.",

      "Former Aston Villa star Stan Collymore has predicted Manchester United will soon be 'sniffing around' Unai Emery to replace Ruben Amorim. Current Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after a dismal start to the season - the club's worst since the 1992/93 campaign.",
      "Currently languishing in 11th place in the Premier League, United also suffered an embarrassing League Cup defeat at the hands of Grimsby Town. The club's rocky start follows a disappointing 15th place finish last season - their lowest in the Premier League era.",
      "Adding insult to injury, they were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May, meaning Old Trafford has no European football for the first time in over 10 years. With Amorim's position becoming increasingly precarious, it's no surprise that some of Europe's top managerial talent are being linked with the job.",
      "One such name is Villa's Emery, who was rumoured to be in the frame during Erik ten Hag's troubled tenure at United last year. Despite a slow start to the season with Villa, Emery's work in Birmingham has been widely lauded.",
      "His potential departure from Villa Park seems more plausible following the exit of the club's President of Football Operations, Monchi, on Monday, as he and Emery have been closely associated. Now, Collymore has weighed in on the unexpected news from his old club.",
      "\"Monchi. Lots of social media with others in recruitment about how hard they worked (so do others, especially Brighton and Bournemouth) which struck a chord with Villans as the going was good,\" he said via X (Twitter).",
      "\"But I make it three resounding successes in the market (players who play for the first team, not jiggery pokery for PSR) in Tielemans, Rogers and Pau out of a 20+ incoming of players. That's average recruitment at best. Emery wanted him and this now raises the question as to whether Unai's tenure will now grind to an end of season halt (*fires starting pistol on speculation every week about United, etc etc etc) or whether Unai has agreed with my analysis, biffed off a great friend but \"business is business\" and a new shiny recruitment guy comes in with a better strike rate.",
      "\"Said on here a few weeks back that recruitment at a club like Villa has to be at 80+% success rate in order to compete so that's the task for the new person. I hope Emery strikes up a rapport with someone new and gets his mojo back, doubles down and commits to the long haul.",
      "\"He's not of our neck of the woods though, he'll have suitors in Spain, probably one or two big Italian clubs and should United be serious about change then they'll have a sniff too, why wouldn't they, they can offer almost unlimited resources to back up what Villa did last season with multiple seasons of serious cash support.",
      "\"The next 48 hours will tell everything. If he's bullish and wants to stay, you'll see it as he's a straight talker. If he doesn't look at the camera, fidgits with his ear and doesn't answer 'do you see your long term at Villa?' then the owners and new recruitment guy need to get a list together quickly in case he exits sooner or end of season. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. UP THE RECRUITMENTLESS VILLA.\"",

However, Casemiro was also shown a red card just before half time, and Trevoh Chalobah capitalised on some slack defending to head home with 10 minutes left.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been spared by the Spanish media after being dropped for arriving late to a pre-match meeting. Despite his superb match-winning brace against Newcastle in the Champions League last week, the on-loan striker found himself on the bench for Barca’s La Liga clash with Getafe on Sunday.",
      "Rashford came off the bench at half-time and set up a Dani Olmo goal as Hansi Flick’s side strolled to a 3-0 home win. Since the game, it has been widely reported in Spain that Rashford was cut from the starting line-up after being two minutes late for a team rendezvous.",
      "His tardiness has been attributed to filling out an electronic form, which the club requires every player to complete each day. The Manchester United loanee wasn’t late for the pre-match activation session, due to start an hour later, but Flick, a strict disciplinarian, insists any player who doesn’t arrive on time doesn’t start the following game.",
      "Rashford isn’t the first player to be affected by the German coach’s team rules, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and, most recently, Raphinha being dropped for similar reasons. Rashford was reportedly due to start the Getafe game on the left side of Barca’s attack, but Ferran Torres got the nod instead.",
      "His response to his omission was telling, though, with no suggestion that he sulked about being dropped. After replacing Raphinha at the break, Rashford impressed on the right side of the attack as well as laying on Olmo’s game-clinching third goal.",
      "While the Spanish media has largely overlooked aside Rashford’s indiscretion, former Spain international Lluis Carreras wasn’t so lenient as he backed Flick’s methods. He said via SER: “I can’t imagine being late to a training camp. It shows the coach that you're not fully focused on the match.",
      "“Since you haven’t been focused, I’ll give you half so you can stay involved in the game. Raphinha [who scored twice after coming on against Valencia] showed that with two goals, Rashford with an assist, and it seems logical to me.”",
      "But it was all positive from Rashford after the game when he took to Instagram. “+3 points, vamos equipo [let’s go team],” he wrote with an image of himself in action.",
      "When questioned about his decision to bench Rashford, Flick insisted he was managing the forward’s workload, saying: “For Rashford, it’s normal not to play. Matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes.",
      "“You saw that with Fermin. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.",
      "“We scored three goals, and it's not always easy to score three goals against a strong team. I don't want to talk about the opponent; I want to talk about my team. We must focus on our game and our plan.” Barca, who are two points behind leaders Real Madrid, visit Real Oviedo on Thursday.",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has made an astonishing claim as he accused Marcus Rashford of 'quitting' after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old got off the mark for the Catalan club in the Champions League with a brace that sunk Newcastle United last week.",
      "The forward also chipped in with an assist during their weekend 3-0 triumph against Getafe, extending his impressive beginning since his latest temporary switch from Old Trafford. Rashford has returned to the headlines following his positive performances but it comes after his unceremonious exit after being cast aside under the Portuguese tactician.",
      "Rashford expressed his desire to explore his options after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. Late in the summer transfer window, his move to a Champions League club came to fruition.",
      "His displays for Unai Emery's outfit secured him a recall to the England squad after slipping down the hierarchy under Thomas Tuchel's predecessor, Gareth Southgate.",
      "While Scholes acknowledged Rashford's ability, he hammered the 27-year-old's mentality regarding his behaviour during his troublesome period with United.",
      "\"There's no doubt the talent that kid has got, it's ridiculous, he's shown up in a big game, and that second goal was brilliant,\" he said.",

      "\"You've got a massive 80,000 there, whatever it is, every single week that you have to put a bit of effort in.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Anderson has been ordered to serve prison time over a reported failure to pay child maintenance. The 37-year-old has been warned he can be held behind bars for 30 days unless he hands over the £142,000 he is said to owe.",
      "The decision was taken on September 3 by a family court judge in the retired footballer’s southern Brazilian home city of Porto Alegre but only emerged overnight.",
      "Brazilian press say international Anderson, who won the Premier League four times with United after signing for the club from Porto in July 2007, will be confined to his cell.",
      "He'll be closely supervised under a tough 'closed regime' if there is space for him in local jails unless he makes an eleventh-hour payment.",
      "They are reporting he will be allowed out to study or do community work during the day, but have to return to his lock-up at night, under a more lax 'semi-open regime' only if there is prison overcrowding. The court decision is understood to be based on the alimony payments Anderson owed as of July 28.",
      "The former footballer, who also played for Fiorentina in Italy and Internacional in his homeland before hanging up his boots aged just 31, has yet to make any official comment.",
      "His lawyer Julio Cezar Coitinho Jr confirmed to local press the case involved minors but said he couldn’t comment because of a secrecy order. Anderson was said to be father to four children in 2015 and NINE children at the start of last year when he recalled his time at United in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper.",
      "He revealed he and his former Portuguese team-mate Nani were “adopted” by Cristiano Ronaldo for nearly a year while they slept at his house, saying their beds were stretchers.",
      "He said: “I thank him very much. He adopted me. We lived at Ronaldo's house for almost a year. We left because we wanted to leave. For him we could have stayed there. We didn't spend anything. The guy took us to training, fed us, had a cook for us. There was a swimming pool inside and outside the house, a jacuzzi, and a tennis court.\"",
      "Anderson was capped eight times for his country. He made his Brazil debut during the 2007 Copa America, which they went on to win. He also played for the Brazil Olympic football team during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, helping them secure the bronze medal.",
      "He scored his first goal for United in the Audi Cup friendly tournament against Boca Juniors in July 2009, two years after signing a five-year contract with the club to become its second Brazilian player after Kleberson.",
      "Anderson signed a new four-and-a-half year contract with United in December 2010, switching to Brazilian club Sport Club Internacional on a free transfer during the 2014-15 season after falling out of favour.",

      "Rio Ferdinand claimed Benjamin Sesko may have to take a leaf out of Ruud van Nistelrooy's book and walk out of training if he wants his Manchester United team-mates to know what his demands are.",
      "The Slovenian's goalless start to life at Old Trafford continued on Saturday as he fired a blank against 10-man Chelsea. Sesko was hauled off at half-time, which was not a glowing assessment of his performance, with the striker largely ineffective during his time on the pitch.",
      "Sesko was signed for £74million and that price tag is set to hang over him until he finds the back of the net. Ferdinand couldn't believe his lack of involvement in what was a dominant first-half display for the Red Devils - in part owing to his lack of service.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"In the first half, against 10 men, he’s had six touches. Six touches! I think the responsibility goes to the striker as well [as other players].",
      "\"In today’s game there’s enough at your disposal technology-wise and clip-wise that you can get it in black and white on the iPad and say to your team-mates, ‘You know when you got in that position, look where I am.'\"",
      "Ferdinand referenced scenarios where Amad, playing out wide, had the opportunity to find Sesko but didn't.",
      "As a result he's recalled how Van Nistelrooy, who scored 150 times in Manchester, once walked off the training pitch when Cristiano Ronaldo didn't cross him the ball to him and believes Sesko could benefit from a similar act.",
      "He added: \"It’s decision making in the final third that’s going to set him free or it isn’t, and he’s got to try and dictate to a lot of those players either through runs that make it so obvious or physically telling them after a game.",
      "\"They’re the type of conversations he has to have because I know Ruud [van Nistelrooy] was having that.",
      "\"I saw Ruud van Nistelrooy walk off the training field because Ronaldo did too many step overs and he wasn’t playing it when he wanted it. You’ve got to find it from somewhere to make your team-mates know, and that will be the making of him.\"",
      "Sesko arrived with a reputation as one of Europe's best young strikers. He had impressed at RB Leipzig.",
      "But so far in Manchester, Ruben Amorim has started him from the bench in three of his five games, albeit the 22-year-old has not furthered his case when he has started.",

      "Brazilian legend Ronaldinho remains one of the most painful 'what if' stories in Manchester United's modern era. The Red Devils were tantalisingly close to landing the 2002 World Cup champion's signature in 2023, but a dramatic eleventh-hour U-turn saw the future Ballon d'Or recipient choose Barcelona instead.",
      "The mesmerising attacker was allegedly mere days away from being unveiled as United's latest marquee signing during the club's pre-season American tour in the summer of '03. Yet even Sir Alex Ferguson's magnetic appeal couldn't compete with the irresistible pull of the Catalan giants.",
      "Ronaldinho subsequently became the planet's finest footballer whilst in Spain. He claimed the Ballon d'Or in 2005 whilst securing two La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2006.",
      "In his memoir, Sir Alex revealed precisely how near the Brazilian transfer came to completion. \"I had agreed a deal to bring him to Old Trafford. Carlos Quieroz [United's assistant manager at the time] was there and would vouch for that,\" Ferguson wrote.",
      "\"The attempt to buy Ronaldinho reflected the fact that United have always sported talismanic players. I was always hunting for that kind of talent. My line of reasoning was, 'We're getting £25m for Beckham, and we're getting Ronaldinho for £19m. For God's sake, wake up. It was a steal.\"",
      "Among them was former United midfielder Paul Scholes, who revealed he went from getting ready to welcome the then-PSG star to trying to tackle him in a friendly just days afterwards.",
      "Speaking on Robbie Savage's Savage Social podcast, Scholes said: \"We were away at pre-season and I think they were as close as announcing him and giving him the number, but he ended up changing his mind last minute and he signed for Barcelona.",
      "\"It's strange really because that pre-season tour we were playing against Barcelona, so we were all excited. We thought he was going to bring something special, almost like what (Eric) Cantona brought to the team. Then three days later we're playing against him in Seattle, so everyone's trying to kick him! We were trying to beat him because he didn't sign for us.\"",
      "Ronaldinho told El Enganche in 2014 that boardroom changes at Barcelona, plus the club's track record of nurturing Brazilian talent, swayed his decision.",
      "\"Everything was beautiful and happened fast. A great friend of mine was about to become a part of the Barcelona board: Sandro Rosell,\" Ronaldinho said. \"I was almost on my way to Manchester United and only the details needed to be put onto that deal. But in the last minute Rosell called me to tell me they would win the election. That made everything happen fast. I wanted to play in Barcelona.",
      "\"I had the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of my idols. I was proud to play where Romario, Ronaldo and Rivaldo had played and I had the chance to be Barcelona's new 'R.' I loved that.\"",
      "While United may have missed out on Ronaldinho, Sir Alex soon after snapped up a young talent named Cristiano Ronaldo, and as they say, the rest is history.",

      "Mainoo is desperate to start regularly for United again after slipping down the pecking order.",
      "The 20-year-old wanted to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request. The MEN have been told Mainoo did not want to leave his boyhood club permanently, and only wanted a loan for the sake of regular minutes in an important season.",
      "The youngster has reacted positively to the denial of his loan request and is focused on forcing his way into United's starting team so that he can represent England at the 2026 World Cup.",

I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",

      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this term. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",

      "Manchester United’s trip to Brentford on Saturday has been given an extra edge following the fall-out between the two clubs over the summer sale of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The lunchtime kick-off sees Mbeumo return to his old club for the first time since his acrimonious £65million - rising to a potential £71m with add-ons - move to United.",
      "Mbeumo completed his move on July 21, but the switch was overshadowed by a row between the two clubs, with United accusing Brentford of trying to drive up the forward’s price, as well as asking him to lower his wage demands to enable them to command a bigger transfer fee.",
      "United sources also claimed Brentford put pressure on Mbeumo to join Tottenham or Newcastle instead, but the Cameroon international - a boyhood United fan - was adamant he would only move to Old Trafford and dug his heels in over the move.",
      "United had two bids rejected before making it third time lucky by landing Mbeumo, but the Old Trafford hierarchy were keen to let it be known how dismayed they were with what they perceived to be Brentford’s underhand approach to the negotiations.",
      "While Mbeumo can expect a positive reception from Brentford fans on his return, it remains to be seen if the ill-feeling over the saga of his move to United creates a frosty atmosphere between officials from both clubs on Saturday at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "What is certain is that United have struggled at the west London stadium in recent seasons, since Brentford gained Premier League status in 2021, since when they have established themselves as a solid top-flight side.",
      "Although their first visit there - under interim boss Ralf Rangnick- ended in a 3-1 win, United legend Cristiano Ronaldo’s petulant strop overshadowed that triumph.",
      "The following season, Erik ten Hag’s United suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat in only his second game in charge, ordering his players to report for training the following day to run 14km - the distance they were out-run by their Brentford counterparts.",
      "On his second visit to Brentford, Ten Hag looked to be heading for victory thanks to a 96th-minute goal from Mason Mount, his first for United, only for Brentford to level in the 99th minute to snatch a 1-1 draw.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s first visit to Brentford back in May ended in a 4-3 defeat, with the United boss looking to reverse that result on Saturday by winning back-to-back league games for the first time since taking charge, following Saturday’s hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea.",

      "When he returns to Brentford on Saturday, Bryan Mbeumo can console himself with the fact he will not be subjected to the kind of vitriolic abuse Manchester United fans reserved for Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Mbeuemo returns to his former club for the first time since his £65million summer move to United, where the home fans are sure to show their appreciation for their former striker, rather than barrack him for leaving.",
      "Unlike Garnacho, who was taunted and barracked by United fans as he warmed up during United's 2-1 win over Chelsea, Mebumo's departure from Brentford was nowhere near as toxic as that of the Argentina winger, hence his likely returning hero's welcome.",
      "On leaving Brentford, where he spent six years, scoring 70 goals from 242 appearances, Mbeumo showed his class by producing a thank you video for the west London club and its supporters, for the journey they shared.",
      "The video depicted Mbeumo in a spaceship, ready to take off on his new adventure with United, but not before reflecting on some stand out memories of his time at Brentford, which played out on a TV screen. The final message on the screen read: “It's time to take off. Thank you Brentford for everything, forever. I will always love you and miss you all.”",
      "Contrast that with Garnacho's petulant and acrimonious exit from United – despite him posting a message with a similar sentiment on social media - and it is easy to see why Mbeumo will not be greeted with rancour and rage on his return to the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo has hit the ground running at United and made an positive start, all the more impressive for a player who was behind the rest of Ruben Amorim's squad in his pre-season programme and did not make his debut on the US summer tour until the final game, a 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta.",
      "The 26-year-old forward was restricted to 45 minutes at Mercedes Benz Stadium and was given 74 minutes in United's final pre-season friendly, against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, which ended in a 1-1 draw.",
      "Despite lagging behind others in terms of his pre-season plan, Mbeumo has started all five of United's Premier League games and only been subbed in one – last Saturday's win over Chelsea, when he was replaced by Mason Mount with 21 minutes left.",
      "By the time he left the pitch, Mbeumo could reflect on another productive performance, not least in drawing the foul that saw Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez shown a straight red card for taking him out after just four minutes.",
      "Mbeumo anticipated Benjamin Sesko's headed flick-on from keeper Altay Bayindir's fine long-range delivery, the United forward's speed and awareness giving him a crucial edge in drawing away from his closest pursuers, Moises Caicedo and Wesley Fofana, before getting to the ball ahead of Sanchez, whose instinct was to halt his progress by foul means.",
      "After his side's hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea, Amorim was asked about the move that yielded the red card for Sanchez and said United had played to Mbeumo's strengths in making early runs in behind opposing defences, something he did with regular success at Brentford.",
      "“With Brian it's something we saw in the characteristics of the player playing for his last team,” said Amorim, asked about the move that led to Sanchez's red card. “You can feel it in every detail, every run, every touch, Brian is really aggressive in his runs, so we want that, we want to use the good things that he had in his former club and those characteristics are really important for us.”",
      "With two goals already – he was denied a sublime volley in the Manchester derby by an equally spectacular save from Gianluigi Donnarumma – Mbeumo is already shaping up to be United's best signing of the summer and on Saturday can prove that by returning to haunt his old club.",

      "Jason Wilcox recently said he \"prays\" that will get the opportunity to turn Manchester United around.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested Wilcox has the 'best set of eyes in football' and eventually promoted him to become the director of football following the shock decision to axe Dan Ashworth.",
      "Wilcox is close to Ratcliffe and has been empowered to oversee football operations, so it was fascinating to hear him say he hopes he'll get the chance to return the club to its former glories, which suggests he is perhaps fearful for his future in Manchester after United's disappointing start to the season.",
      "After the Manchester derby defeat, Wilcox spoke at an event at Old Trafford for ex-players and it was illuminating to hear him speak about his challenging start to working at United. YouTube channel Man Utd The Religion recorded interview.",
      "“It has been a rollercoaster,\" said Wilcox. \"I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it’s been a real challenge, I can’t lie. I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy.",
      "“And we’ve just been working so hard behind the scenes. There’s been a lot of work that’s gone on to change the staff. I know in the media, there's an awful lot of coverage around the redundancies.",
      "“But the football club needed to go through a period of transformation, without a doubt. Forget the redundancies. The whole structure of Manchester United needed to change… I would have done it from a sporting side. I did the same at Southampton, at Man City.",
      "\"It's important we have a leaner workforce that provides accountability and responsibility for people. It's really sad to see people lose their jobs, but it needed to be done.\"",
      "He continued: \"Now we’ve got a platform to rebuild. I didn't realise how big this club was, even though I've competed against this club as a player and as a coach. This club is a wonderful club.",
      "“I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel it's not 'will we win again', I think it's 'when will we win again'. It's going to take time and it's not a quick fix, especially now with the regulations.",
      "\"We needed to change the playing squad. We've made some really good additions this summer. Sometimes taking players out of the squad is as important as the players you bring in.",
      "\"We have to bring back the culture and respect back to Man United, whether you work for us, or play against us, you feel like you're part of something special. I'm extremely proud, I'm extremely privileged, but I am extremely frustrated as well because we can't fix it quickly enough.\"",
      "The interview has gained traction because it's rare to hear Wilcox speak in public - he is usually only quoted alongside the announcements of new signings. It was refreshing to hear him speak candidly.",
      "Will Wilcox get the chance to turn it around? That depends on the results this season. United made an awful start to the campaign, but the outlook is already much better after the win against Chelsea.",
      "If Ruben Amorim fails, it will not reflect well on Wilcox, but he won't be the only boardroom member who could face consequences. Omar Berrada, United's CEO, oversaw the appointment of Amorim, and Ratcliffe will point fingers if the Portuguese fails in his mission to succeed.",
      "The breadcrumbs would lead back to Wilcox and Berrada. Ratcliffe has entrusted the pair to mastermind a Premier League title and they would be questioned if sacking Amorim is eventually necessary.",
      "The good news is Brentford and Sunderland look winnable before the October international break, and Amorim has a golden chance to win back-to-back league games for the first time.",
      "However, if the situation worsens this season, even Wilcox and Berrada might not be safe.",

      "Despite Casemiro being sent off in the fifth minute of first-half stoppage time, United managed to hold on, even though Trevoh Chalobah reduced the deficit with 10 minutes remaining.",
      "This win alleviates some of the pressure that had been mounting on Amorim following their loss to Manchester City in the derby. They now look ahead to away and home matches against Brentford and Sunderland respectively, before their next significant challenge - a trip to Anfield to face Premier League leaders Liverpool after the October international break.",

It is anticipated that central midfield will be the next area United focus on, with players such as Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Ruben Neves all recently linked with a move to United.",

      "Rashford might have been stuck in traffic or slept through his alarm. And it was just two minutes, but he is paid handsomely to do his job and should be able to follow Flick's rules at Barcelona.",
      "Manchester United wouldn't have been shocked to hear of Rashford's punishment for being late to the meeting, as there have been concerns about his off-field behaviour in recent years.",
      "Rashford was not axed from the club after a boozy jaunt to Belfast. Erik ten Hag was furious at the trip, but believed it would be detrimental to freeze Rashford out of his plans and disciplined him instead.",
      "Ruben Amorim was not as forgiving when he saw something he did not like with Rashford in December. The academy graduate was dropped for the Manchester derby and sent on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona offered Rashford the perfect opportunity to breathe life into his career. Most pundits predicted that Rashford would be a success - La Liga is a weaker league and a change of scenery was expected to do him good - and his performance at St. James' Park was a reminder of his ability.",
      "\"I am not surprised,\" Flick said. \"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills and finishing are unbelievable. I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there.",
      "\"In the second half, it was. For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy. He is an important player. When we spoke before the season about what we needed in the team, we felt we needed a player like him. When we had this chance [to sign him], I said we have to do it. He's an outstanding player.\"",
      "Flick added that Rashford's display had represented the \"first step\" and reiterated he needed to make \"the next step.\" The German was hinting at consistency, but Rashford was denied the chance to build momentum due to his lack of punctuality.",
      "Rashford came off the bench against Getafe for the second half to record an assist. His talent has never been in doubt, but Rashford must strive to become a model professional to get the best out of his career.",
      "Amorim's stance on Rashford has ultimately been vindicated by the events of the last week.",
      "Rashford sparkled against Newcastle, a fixture in his home country with millions of British eyes tuned in, but he needs to produce those displays each week.",
      "It was brilliant to see Rashford in full flow against Newcastle, but everyone was thinking: where is this level every weekend? He is capable of so much but has struggled for consistency.",
      "His failure to produce those consistent performances and concerns about his behaviour away from the pitch have prevented him from bridging the gap to become a world-class player.",
      "Consistency is the hardest part of football, however, it shouldn't be difficult to follow club rules. Rashford's lateness shouldn't be blown completely out of proportion - it was only two minutes after all - but it's not the first time he's been disciplined.",
      "He has been given a chance he cannot afford to waste at Barcelona. It would be a huge shame to see him squander an opportunity to kick on in his career because of more discipline issues.",

      "Midfield is expected to be a priority for Ruben Amorim’s side as they plan for the winter window, with the problems in the position well-documented.",
      "United are expected to retain their interest in Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. The club contacted the Seagulls about a possible summer move, but were told that they would need to offer a price of around £115 million for Brighton to even consider selling.",
      "That caused United to walk away from any potential deal before the deadline.",
      "Even if Brighton’s stance softens in the January window, it will still be an expensive deal to do for United. They could, therefore, start to look at alternative options.",
      "One of those could be Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher. According to Fabrizio Romano, the club had a loan offer for Gallagher rejected by Atletico towards the end of the summer window.",
      "But the latest reports suggest that United could be given a second chance to complete a move for the former Chelsea midfielder.",
      "Mundo Deportivo (via SportWitness) reports that Gallagher will be available for around €60 million (£52.4m) when the January transfer window opens. United are said to be one of the clubs monitoring the situation.",
      "That asking price would be around half that United could expect to pay for Baleba if they return for the Brighton man in January.",
      "So far this season, Gallagher has started just two of the six games in all competitions, playing the first half of the season opener against Espanyol and then playing just over an hour of the Champions League clash against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "He has been named as a substitute for the other four matches, although he has come onto the pitch in the second half of all four of those games.",
      "The report indicates that Gallagher may find it hard to cement a place back in Atletico's starting XI for the rest of the season. The player is not a perfect fit for Diego Simeone’s system.",

      "The sanction from Hansi Flick came just days after Rashford's match-winning double against the Magpies in the Champions League. The brace was the first two goals for the forward since his well-publicised move to the La Liga giants in the summer, from United.",
      "Despite being dropped to the bench for the visit of Getafe, the attacker came on to provide an assist for Dani Olmo in their 3-0 win on Sunday. Rashford got his move to a Champions League club during the summer transfer window after Aston Villa failed to trigger the buy option in his contract.",
      "There is a similar clause in his agreement with Barcelona that could permanently end his association with United after progressing through the ranks to become an academy graduate.",

      "\"Rashford can’t be unprofessional, it’s not right,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"We know that if Rashford is ready and if his attitude is right then there's a player in there.",
      "\"He was sensational against Newcastle. The second finish in particular was amazing. But you can't be unprofessional.",
      "\"Why should everyone hang around just for you? Why should everyone else be on time but you be late? It's not right.",
      "\"I guess if he wants to stay there, particularly only being on-loan, you can't do that when you're at a top club like Barcelona because there'll always be someone to take your place.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if you're two minutes late or 20 minutes late. You're late and your teammates have to wait for you. Why should they all be on time and you not?\"",
      "Rashford took to social media on Tuesday in his first public post since the incident. The 27-year-old said he is back in 'focus mode' ahead of Barca's clash away at Oviedo on Thursday night.",

      "Of the five changes made by Ruben Amorin in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea, that of Harry Maguire was perhaps the most curious.",
      "Maguire, restored to United's starting line-up in the Premier League for the first time this season after three sub appearances, was replaced by Leny Yoro after 70 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim gave no specific reason afterwards for the change, but given it was Maguire's first start this season, it is safe to assume he was replaced to protect him from injury.",
      "Amorim has spoken often about the dangers players face in games when they enter the “red zone” and are more susceptible to injury, hence why he makes so many in-game defensive changes.",
      "Given Maguire was immense on Saturday in the centre of United's three-man defence, with Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw equally impressive either side, those within the stadium were understandably puzzled by his withdrawal with 20 minutes plus added time remaining.",
      "But Amorim's thinking in making the switch was clearly to protect Maguire, who has surely now cemented his place in the United manager's first-choice back three, along with De Ligt on his right and Shaw on the left, after his rousing display against Chelsea.",
      "Yoro may have started all four of United's Premier League games until the weekend, but he struggled in the abject 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City the previous weekend, which is why Maguire came back into the starting line-up.",
      "Maguire's towering display, complemented by the equally dogged and disciplined performances of De Ligt and Shaw, makes it unlikely Amorim will want to change his three centre-backs for Saturday lunchtime's trip to Brentford.",
      "One Maguire moment on Saturday, as the swirling rain fell on a filthy night, drew nearly as big a cheer as both United goals. With five minutes to go until half-time, Maguire chased down a 50-50 ball with Chelsea's Joao Pedro and got to it first, sliding across the turf to send it emphatically out of play and clear the danger.",
      "The clearance drew a huge cheer from United fans, with the decibel level increased when Maguire picked himself back up off the turf and purposefully but subtly barged into Pedro as he ran to get back into position, sending a clear message to the Chelsea striker that he was not to be messed with.",
      "The aggressive clearance and belligerent barge into Pedro demonstrated Maguire's confidence on Saturday, something he has struggled with at times during his turbulent six-year United career, but which now looks restored, allowing him to produce his best form.",
      "Maguire's aggressive and focused approach was shared by De Ligt and Shaw, the former making a vital last-ditch clearance to block a cross with Chelsea pushing for an equaliser, the latter making an equally important recovery tackle on Andrey Santos to halt a dangerous breakaway late on.",
      "Before the Chelsea game, Maguire was presented with a framed shirt and pictures to mark his 250th appearance for United, which came with his substitute appearance in the derby loss at City six days earlier.",
      "The milestone underlines Maguire's enduring value and importance to United, despite his much-maligned status outside of the club. As well as his defensive reliability, Maguire has proved effective at the other end of the pitch, plundering 16 goals, including six in the 89th minute or later, three of them winners and one last-gasp equaliser.",
      "At a time when United need stability, aggression and balance at the back, Maguire's return to the side and his return to his imposing best could not have come at a better time as Amorim seeks to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking charge.",

      "It seems incredulous, as he approaches a year in charge of Manchester United, that Ruben Amorim has failed to win back-to-back Premier League games.",
      "Amorim's record of nine wins from 32 Premier League games is pitiful, but of just as much concern is his failure to carry over the winning formula from those games into the next one.",
      "Even David Moyes, who lasted just 10 months at United - the same length of time Amorim has been in charge - won back-to-back league games on seven occasions during his ill-fated spell in charge.",
      "At Brentford on Saturday lunchtime, Amorim will once again try to string successive league wins together and build on the momentum and confidence gained from Saturday's gritty 2-1 win over Chelsea at a rain-lashed Old Trafford.",
      "Victory at the Gtech Community Stadium in the early kick-off would propel United up to the dizzy heights of a top-five place, before the later games kick off.",
      "More importantly, it would provide tangible proof of the progress Amorim claims to see every day in training, but has yet to be translated into matches in terms of consistency of results and performance.",
      "After every league win under Amorim – and they have been hard to come by, let's be honest – it has been a case of one step forward, two steps back, a false dawn for United's manager, players and fans, with their ongoing failure to make winning a habit.",
      "After a rousing 4-0 win over Everton in only his second game in charge, Amorim delivered his notable “a storm will come” soundbite and it did so three days later, as United went down 2-0 at title-chasing Arsenal.",
      "Despite that defeat, hopes were high among United fans after their late smash-and-grab 2-1 derby win at local rivals Manchester City, but again they capitulated in their next league outing, humiliated 3-0 at home to Bournemouth three days before Christmas.",
      "United had to wait until January 16 for their next win, a 3-1 triumph over Southampton, but reverted to type three days later, going down 3-1 at home to Brighton. Subsequent wins came over Fulham, Ipswich, Leicester and Aston Villa in the final game of the season, but none were backed up by another triumph.",
      "Defender Luke Shaw was honest enough to admit United's lack of consistency has been their biggest failing, not just under Amorim, but his predecessors, and admitted the team have to start putting together winning runs if they want to start challenging towards the top end of the table again.",
      "Shaw, speaking after the Chelsea win, said: “We spoke about it a lot this week - winning this game, winning three points and moving on to the next. The standard we have to set is how we did in the first-half. It's about being consistent and maintaining the levels, not just for 30 minutes or 45 minutes. It's where we need to get to if we want to be a top, top team at the top of the league.",
      "“I felt like we were going to win. I think that's how we have to feel every game. We have to feel like we're going to go into the game and win. That doesn't matter who we play, home or away, we have to have that mentality every game – that we're going to win. We've got to go into games with that mindset.”",
      "Shaw was spot-on in his assessment of United and the mentality they need to develop if they are to become a successful team again. But actions speak louder than words and on Saturday in west London we will discover if Amorim's players can turn rhetoric into results and achieve back-to-back wins under him for the very first time.",

      "Former Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho got off to a tough start to life at Chelsea in his first start for the Blues since his summer move to Stamford Bridge, playing just 59 minutes of the Carabao Cup third round clash as Ruben Amorim's transfer decision was vindicated.",
      "The former United winger was given a frosty welcome by home supporters on his way into the LNER Stadium and was booed throughout the game by the Lincoln faithful.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side struggled with the Imps' long balls into the box and physicality in the opening stages. So much so, that Garnacho was left in a heap on the floor after a tackle from Lincoln City defender Tendayi Darikwa.",
      "The Blues were awarded a free kick, much to the annoyance of the home support, with the Argentinian rolling around in pain, which only intensified the boos as the 21-year-old got back to his feet.",
      "As the half wore on, Maresca's side did appear more comfortable, but a calamitous error at the back gifted the home side a goal on the brink of half-time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's cross-field ball didn't have enough on it to reach Trevoh Chalobah. Ivan Varfolomeev beat the Blues man to the ball, nodding it down into the path of Rob Street, who finished well, finding the bottom corner from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "There was no changes at the break for Chelsea, despite their poor first 45 minutes and the Blues' boss got an immediate response through Tyrique George, who hit a first time volley in off the post from the edge of the area to equalise just two minutes into the second half.",
      "George then turned provider for Facundo Buonanotte in the 49th minute to put Chelsea ahead. Despite creating one opportunity, it was a rather uneventful evening for Garnacho who was replaced after 59 minutes by fellow summer signing Willian Estevao.",
      "The Chelsea winger looked rather unhappy on his way to the bench with the Blues holding out for a 2-1 win to avoid a potential banana skin. It was that facial expression that United supporters saw all too often towards the end of his Old Trafford tenure.",
      "The Argentinian was an unused substitute following the 2-1 defeat to United at the weekend, denying him an Old Trafford return outing. Amorim's comments about the winger spoke volumes in the build-up to the Chelsea game, with a reluctance to talk about Garnacho.",
      "\"Guys, I'm not concerned about that,\" the Portuguese head coach said. \"I just want to win games. I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, if the other player is going to play well.",
      "\"They are good players and they will play well if things happen. I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",
      "Judging by his performance against Lincoln, it's fair to say the early signs show Amorim was vindicated with his decision to part ways this summer.",

      "Legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson used to storm to the back of the club bus and lambaste members of his squad for being too loud while playing video games.",
      "The revelation came courtesy of former United midfielder Paul Scholes, who was speaking on the The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and former Red Devil Nicky Butt.",
      "It began as McGuinness brought up a story told by Old Trafford legend Wayne Rooney. United's all-time top scorer claimed part of the club's astronomical success, during his time at United, was down to the relationships the players forged while playing video games on the team bus.",
      "Several United players would get involved with the game, SOCOM on the PlayStation Portable, including Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea and Wes Brown. Despite Rooney's claims, the gaming sessions didn't go down well with Sir Alex, who was renowned for ruling with an iron fist.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Asked about Rooney's claims, Scholes explained: \"I didn't play those games, it was more the younger lads in the group.",
      "\"The PSP (the PlayStation Portable) and SOCOM, and I can hear them all f*****g shouting from the back of the bus, and it's sort some of shooting game, a war game, and it's all you could hear and it was f*****g annoying.\"",
      "After McGuinness interjected, claiming bus trips to and from games are typically were players engage in card games, and not video games, Scholes added: \"I do remember the boss going down the back of the bus saying, 'Shut the f**k up - because they're all shouting at each other, 'We're on our way to Arsenal away here, what's wrong with you?'\".",
      "Although, he did concede that there may have been some benefit to the group gaming, adding: \"Sometimes it's quite funny as they are having a right go at each other at the back and there is a bit of camaraderie and it's a team game as well.\"",
      "Rooney won five Premier League titles and a Champions League title during his time at United. Speaking on his self-titled podcast the ex-Everton star opened up on how playing the online shooting game helped to get his team-mates talking more.",
      "\"I really believe a big part of our success was playing on the PSP,\" said Rooney. \"It got us communicating more - we used to play it on the plane, on the team bus.",
      "\"It would be me, Rio [Ferdinand], Michael Carrick, John O'Shea, Wes Brown. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go and revive people when they get killed and it was a massive part of our success - ask any of those players, it was brilliant.\"",

      "Manchester United showed this summer that there are occasions when you simply have to sell whether that means the deal is perfect for the club or not.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho needed to be sold in the last transfer window as his relationship with the club was causing more harm than good. Marcus Rashford was similar, albeit to a lesser extent as you feel he may not have burnt all his bridges but, on the balance of evidence, it was still right to move him on.",
      "Looking back now, the Reds made an awful error allowing Scott McTominay to leave the football club. Like Garnacho and Rashford, United benefitted from raking in 'pure profit' on the deal so the books looked a lot rosier once he left for Napoli.",
      "But unlike his former teammates, McTominay was not an issue at United. His previous manager Erik ten Hag even spoke with regret at letting the Scottish international leave.",
      "Ten Hag made a snap judgement that he needed to strengthen defensive midfield but instead of trying to offload Casemiro who remains one of the highest paid players at the club, he sold an asset who is now taking the football world by storm. Incredibly, in his first season in Serie A, McTominay managed to blossom more than anyone expected him to.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "His 12 goals and six assists was comfortably his best season of his professional career and he proved to be the key weapon in Antonio Conte's side as they lifted Serie A. However, his redemption arc was only completed fully on Monday night when he finished 18th in the Ballon d'Or rankings ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Florian Wirtz.",
      "And, let's not forget, there was no United player to be seen anywhere near the Top 30. There was a feeling at the time that the decision to sell McTominay was a short-term decision not thoroughly fleshed out and while nobody could have predicted such a sensational season in Italy, the 28-year-old should be used as a cautionary tale for United moving forward.",
      "History is already threatening to repeat itself under Ruben Amorim with Kobbie Mainoo's future starting to look in serious jeopardy. He requested to leave on loan in the summer and while this was rejected, there has been little sign so far that United will be able to appease him in time for the January window opening.",
      "If Mainoo was to 'do a McTominay', he would be better placed to succeed as he is considerably younger and his form at Old Trafford has not been as inconsistent as his predecessor's. Failing to address Mainoo's concerns would once again open United up to making a short-term decision which ultimately hinders the long-term progression of the club.",
      "Mainoo wants to stay with United hence why he only requested to leave on loan but the persistence of sticking so frigidly to captain Bruno Fernandes could force him away permanently. Nobody can question what Fernandes brings to this team but there is a real possibility that he could leave next summer and if Mainoo is already forced out by then, suddenly United are in a real pickle.",
      "Amorim needs to start blooding in Mainoo as the successor to Fernandes. We know he has the quality to do that and we also know that United is a club built on giving youngsters a chance.",
      "If United are to take anything away from McTominay's success it should be that sometimes, it is better to look within for the next generation rather than selling it off for a quick buck. Mainoo's exit, should that scenario transpire, would show that the Reds really don't learn any lessons, at all.",

      "The on-loan Manchester United winger started last week on a high with a stunning two-goal performance for the La Liga giants away against Newcastle in the Champions League. However, the 27-year-old was dropped to the bench for Barcelona's 3-0 win over Getafe on Sunday after it was widely reported in Spain that he was two minutes late to a team gathering.",
      "Barcelona are understood to be keen to secure Rashford's services at a bargain price of £26million, while United are hoping to realise closer £35m for the academy graduate. Foster expressed his disappointment over Rashford's latest transgression, despite praising him for turning back the clock with his display against Newcastle.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Rashford got a couple of goals, it was a fantastic performance and he just looked proper. It was old school Marcus Rashford and we love to see it.",
      "\"Then he goes and gets dropped at the weekend because he was late for a team stretching session on the morning of a game. The way that Barcelona have dealt with it, you can tell Hansi Flick doesn't take any s***.\"",
      "Foster later added: \"It's disrespectful and I understand people going, 'Oh, he's [only] a minute or two late,' but it doesn't matter. There are 29 other people there who are waiting for you. If you can't get the basics right, then it's not good enough.\"",
      "Rashford isn't the only player to get on the wrong side of Flick's tough rules, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and, most recently, Raphinha all being punished for similar reasons. Rashford was understood to be due to start the Getafe game on the left side of Barcelona's frontline, but Ferran Torres was chosen instead.",
      "Despite his exclusion, he showed no outward signs of frustration and came on to replace Raphinha at half-time. Rashford impressed on the right side of attack, providing the assist for Dani Olmo's match-winning third goal.",

      "The 21-year-old was denied a return on the hallowed turf on Saturday as the Londoners suffered a 2-1 defeat. Chelsea were forced to play a portion of the match with 10 men after a red card to Robert Sanchez five minutes in before the numerical balance was restored when Casemiro was sent off on the stroke of half-time.",
      "Garnacho was an unused substitute in the defeat but while he was warming, he got the reception he would've anticipated as he was jeered by supporters following his exit.",
      "In the report from DSports, they report: “Aware that his place on the roster is not guaranteed, Garnacho contacted Lionel Scaloni directly to find out his situation.”",
      "“The coach was clear: his selection will depend on his performance and prominence this season, as he is currently behind in the rankings.”",
      "The attacker has made two appearances since making the switch to Stamford Bridge.",

      "Christian Eriksen believes former Manchester United players can be too critical in the media.",
      "Eriksen said goodbye to Old Trafford on the final day of last season. He wrote a farewell post on social media to thank United fans for their support during his three seasons at the club.",
      "The creative midfielder won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in Manchester. Eriksen's contract with United officially expired at the end of July and he signed for German club Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Eriksen reflected on his time at the club and suggested recent trophy wins have been underappreciated because of United's successful history.",
      "Eriksen said: \"It probably depends who you ask. If you ask a fan, they want to be back to winning the league every year for the next 20 years like they did... this time of football it is almost impossible, to do that with so many other clubs having that many good players around. It's tough.",
      "\"I think obviously they want to get back to that to being stable as a top club, but even being there, winning the FA Cup and the Carabao in the last two seasons is something that any other club would be proud to have done.",
      "\"Then there is also the size and the image and the feeling at United - it's like it's not good enough. I think hopefully that will change. Even the Carabao [Cup] is a small thing, but at that moment it is a big thing.\"",
      "When asked about whether the opinion of ex-players has an impact on United, Eriksen said: \"You see how big the club is, how much people want to be involved with the club, even on the media attention. I think even now we speak about United here. It's just the power of the club.",
      "\"Obviously the more opinionated, the more feelings towards the club are negative, the tougher it is, because the fans follow their heroes on the TV and it doesn't help the players at the club.",
      "\"At the same time at United, as a footballer, there's always someone who has an opinion on one or the other, but you're just playing football. You try to focus on that bit, and I think United were good at that. The focus was on the game itself and not so much what people say.\"",
      "Roy Keane criticised Luke Shaw after the Manchester derby, claiming he \"gave up\" for Phil Foden's opening goal before suggesting the defender \"has been getting away with murder for years.\".",
      "Speaking after the Chelsea win, Shaw responded: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin. He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it but I think he was right.",
      "\"Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be and I think the manager knows that and the managers who I played under in the past know that.",
      "\"I’m always in the team, I’m always playing, so there must be something the managers [see and] must believe in me. I’m not getting any younger and I need to be consistent, I’ve had lots of ups and downs and it’s about keeping that consistently high level because I know I can do that.",
      "\"And that’s why last week hurt me a lot because I know that’s not my level and I think the criticism is completely understandable, I take it on the chin and listen to it and I move on.\"",

      "Former Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore has raised speculation over whether Unai Emery could become the next manager of Manchester United.",
      "Reds boss Ruben Amorim has come under increased pressure this season after United's worst start to the season since 1992/93. Amorim's team are currently 11th in the Premier League and suffered a humiliating League Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "United's shaky start to the new campaign comes after they finished 15th in the top-flight last term - their lowest in the Premier League era. The Reds also lost to Tottenham Hotspur in May's Europa League final - ensuring that no European football will be played at Old Trafford for the first time in over a decade.",
      "And with Amorim's position at M16 coming under increased pressure - many of Europe's top managers have been inevitably linked. One such name has been Villa's Emery, who was heavily linked during Erik ten Hag's struggles at United last year.",
      "Emery's stock may have slightly fallen so far this term amid Villa's sluggish start to the season, but his work in Birmingham has been widely praised. His potential exit from Villa Park may now become more realistic after the club’s President of Football Operations, Monchi, left on Monday, with the Spaniard closely linked with Emery. Now, Collymore has had his say on the surprise news from his former side.",
      "\"Monchi. Lots of social media with others in recruitment about how hard they worked (so do others, especially Brighton and Bournemouth) which struck a chord with Villans as the going was good,\" he said via X (Twitter).",
      "\"But I make it three resounding successes in the market (players who play for the first team, not jiggery pokery for PSR) in Tielemans, Rogers and Pau out of a 20+ incoming of players. That's average recruitment at best. Emery wanted him and this now raises the question as to whether Unai's tenure will now grind to an end of season halt (*fires starting pistol on speculation every week about United, etc etc etc) or whether Unai has agreed with my analysis, biffed off a great friend but \"business is business\" and a new shiny recruitment guy comes in with a better strike rate.",
      "\"Said on here a few weeks back that recruitment at a club like Villa has to be at 80+% success rate in order to compete so that's the task for the new person. I hope Emery strikes up a rapport with someone new and gets his mojo back, doubles down and commits to the long haul.",
      "\"He's not of our neck of the woods though, he'll have suitors in Spain, probably one or two big Italian clubs and should United be serious about change then they'll have a sniff too, why wouldn't they, they can offer almost unlimited resources to back up what Villa did last season with multiple seasons of serious cash support.",
      "\"The next 48 hours will tell everything. If he's bullish and wants to stay, you'll see it as he's a straight talker. If he doesn't look at the camera, fidgits with his ear and doesn't answer 'do you see your long term at Villa?' then the owners and new recruitment guy need to get a list together quickly in case he exits sooner or end of season. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. UP THE RECRUITMENTLESS VILLA.\"",

      "Man Utd have had an underwhelming start to the season with their 2-1 win over Chelsea at the weekend coming at a crucial time for Ruben Amorim after pressure was building on the Portuguese head coach.",
      "And now Amorim and the Man Utd recruitment team are looking to give him more tools in the winter window to turn the Red Devils into a successful side.",
      "Man Utd have been heavily linked with Everton centre-back Branthwaite over the last couple of years and now journalist Mark Brus insists his ‘sources expect Man United to bid £60m’ for the England international, probably in January.",
      "READ: Why Manchester United traitor Paul Scholes went too far with his attack on Marcus Rashford",
      "With Harry Maguire’s future at Man Utd uncertain, Brus describes their interest in Branthwaite as ‘serious’ with the ‘unsettled’ Everton defender keen to join a ‘top club’ in the future.",
      "Revealing the current situation surrounding Maguire, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Maguire is still seen internally, after 250 appearances with Manchester United, as a leader in the dressing room, as a very important player, and this is why his future will be a point of discussion very soon.",
      "“Ruben Amorim really appreciates Harry Maguire’s mentality. People at the club respect what Maguire is trying to do for the young players arriving at the club now, and so, Maguire’s future will surely be a topic.”",
      "One player who is unlikely to have a future at Man Utd is Andre Onana with Romano claiming it’s unlikely that he will play for the Red Devils again.",
      "Romano added: “My understanding is that both sides – Man Utd and Andre Onana himself – see this Man Utd chapter as almost closed. So, it’s very difficult to imagine Onana staying at Man Utd beyond (next summer).",
      "“Man Utd believe that Senne Lammens is going to be the goalkeeper for present and future, so unless something extraordinary happens, (Onana’s agreement) is a straight loan, and he might go somewhere else in the future, but it’s over between Man Utd and Onana, probably.”",
      "Man Utd still need to sign a defensive midfielder in the next couple of transfer windows with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba one player they are interested in.",
      "On Baleba, Romano continued: “The last performance of Carlos Baleba for Brighton against Tottenham was a poor performance. It wasn’t of the level of a player like Baleba. After the game, the coach of Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler, was very honest. He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",
      "“Baleba wanted to go to Man Utd. But he’s always been respectful with Brighton. He was keen on the move. Personal terms were never going to be an issue. The problem was only Brighton and Man Utd. Brighton might consider let him go in 2026 but in 2025 it was always a no. That situation effected the player.",
      "“I’ve told you several times that Man Utd will keep a close eye on Baleba. He’s very much appreciated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "“These performances are not at a Baleba level yet.”",
      "West Ham are reportedly assessing potential replacements for Graham Potter with Slaven Bilic outlining his plan for a potential return.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Arsenal do not want negotiations with Real Madrid target William Saliba over a new contract to go into 2026, according transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Ruben Amorim is under immense pressure at Manchester United, and Fabrizio Romano’s new update on his future has hinted that he is quickly losing support…",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, there is one reason behind Manchester United’s decision on whether to offer a “new contract” to a key star."

      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?",
      "It won’t have surprised Marcus Rashford that moving to another country has failed to extract him from the Manchester United orbit, nor perhaps how strong opinions toward him remain.",
      "But it would be interesting to hear his thoughts on Paul Scholes openly and happily explaining how “I really struggle to feel happy for him” after Rashford kickstarted his Barcelona career this past week.",
      "That is a remarkable admission, an insight which reveals far more uncomfortable truths about the personality of the pundit than it does the character of the player.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude, and his attitude at United by the time he was leaving,” Scholes continued, obviously on a podcast, obviously with Nicky Butt and Paddy McGuiness.",
      "“I thought he was a disgrace at United, and not trying, which look, if you fall out with the manager then okay. But remember, you’ve got teammates you’re playing with, you’ve got a massive 80,000 there, whatever it is every single week that you have to put a bit of effort in for.",
      "“The amount of times I saw him at Man United walking, because he wants to leave…I thought his whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.”",
      "The diatribe went on with shots at his work-rate against Newcastle – in a game he decided with two excellent goals – and culminated in a rant about Rashford being dropped for Barcelona’s next game after turning up late to a pre-match meeting.",
      "“What the f**k? How do you sleep in these days?” an increasingly incredulous Scholes asked, despite it long since having been reported that Rashford had been two minutes late because of a delay in filling out an electronic form, that he didn’t miss any of the pre-match preparations and indeed that he set up the third goal in a win over Valencia from the bench.",
      "A repeat of his past indiscretion under Erik ten Hag this was not.",
      "But that is the sort of fabrication one can only expect from a professional pundit who “really struggles to feel happy for” someone whose sacrifices and shortcomings he really should almost uniquely understand.",
      "Scholes has an important platform and authoritative voice, but also an obligation to use those properly in an arena as highly charged as that of Manchester United. If he cannot relate to and explain the pressures a professional footballer faces at the elite level and the misjudgements that can sometimes force them to make, that reflects abysmally on him rather than Rashford.",
      "The line about how Rashford “actually quit on Manchester United, and once you quit once, you’ll quit again” stood out too, as did the references to his age no longer being a defence of his actions.",
      "And at 27 that is absolutely fair. Rashford should know better than many of the decisions he made towards the ostensible end of his Manchester United career suggested.",
      "He might also justifiably point out he could have “quit on Manchester United” far sooner instead of playing through the pain of back, shoulder and foot injuries to be the most-used player by Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and second for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a 26-year-old Scholes would have been grateful not to face this constant level of withering censure and scrutiny when he made what has since been described as his biggest career regret.",
      "“I made a mistake,” Scholes has said of a moment his “head had just gone” in November 2001. “I did stupid things when I was a kid, when I was younger,” he added of refusing to play in a League Cup tie against Arsenal 24 hours after only getting 13 minutes from the bench in a defeat to Liverpool.",
      "Except he was no more “a kid” then than Rashford is now, no less responsible for his choices and actions. Scholes was fined two weeks’ wages, much as Rashford was during his infamous Belfast-based indiscretion at precisely the same age around 18 months ago.",
      "The difference is less in the players and far more in the club and its corroded culture. Manchester United in 2001 is the diametric opposite to Manchester United in 2025. The former was defined by the support network and sensational man-management of Sir Alex Ferguson; the latter protects nothing and no-one, exposing all it touches to toxicity and self-destruction.",
      "It is what Scholes and the rest of the “circle of Ferguson” so often overlook or take for granted. Their ludicrous talent aligned perfectly with the reign of a genius manager and elite structure which encouraged individual development and offered an environment in which players were protected. They speak from a position of immense ability and vast experience but also absurd fortune.",
      "Had this infernal brand of omnipresent Manchester United player-turned-pundit arrived a generation or two later, been saddled with hierarchical incompetence and intermittent coaching upheaval throughout their careers and had Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Bill Foulkes seeking out every microphone ever manufactured to actively undermine and denigrate them at any opportunity, they too might have found it tough and ultimately decided that leaving was in the best interests of all parties.",
      "Rashford did so in the knowledge that bridges had been burned on both sides, not just his. He won’t have expected a pat on the back and a pledge of lifelong support from the fans in doing so, but it also feels entirely ridiculous for one of his presumed heroes to brand him a “disgrace” who he “really struggles to feel happy for” 10 months after his last appearance for a broken club he tried to carry as far as he could.",
      "Scoring a tap-in against Southampton in the League Cup is the same as a last-minute winner at the Bernabeu right?",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "That was very stupid from Hugo Ekitike and he deserves all the criticism coming his way from Liverpool fans and others.",
      "Liverpool are flying in spite of Alisson underperforming – according to the stats – while James Trafford’s reward for the best numbers is the bench.",
      "Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford has been accused of ‘self-sabotage’ after losing his place in the Barcelona team for poor punctuality.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly be in for an unexpected boost in the transfer market next summer with PSG willing to offer more than Barcelona for Marcus Rashford."

      "Harry Kane reportedly has an exit clause in his Bayern Munich contract that could attract the attention of Premier League clubs Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Kane left Tottenham for Bayern ahead of the 2023/24 season and claimed the first trophy of his career in May, lifting the Bundesliga title.",
      "He has scored an extraordinary 98 goals in 103 matches for the German giants and has started this season in terrific form, registering 13 goals and three assists in seven appearances, including a brace against Chelsea in the Champions League last week.",
      "The 32-year-old will hit a century of goals for Bayern in only 104 games with a brace on Friday against Werder Bremen, which would make him the fastest player in Europe’s top-five leagues to reach that milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland both reached 100 goals in 105 games for Real Madrid and Manchester City, respectively.",
      "READ: Six left-field predictions of players who could win the 2026 Ballon d’Or",
      "Kane has been Bayern’s best and most consistent player since joining for around £100million, and they are reportedly in danger of losing him in the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, there is an ‘exit clause in his contract’ worth €65million (£56.8m), though he would have to ‘announce his move in the winter’.",
      "That fee for a 33-year-old represents ‘a lot of money’ but also ‘could be dangerous for Bayern’, the report states.",
      "However, that ‘doesn’t even buy half the price of Alexander Isak’ and even if Kane stays in Germany until he’s 36, ‘a model professional like him would still be tearing the Bundesliga to pieces’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Kane is said to still be keen to break the Premier League goalscoring record. It’s currently held by Alan Shearer with 260 goals. He himself has 213, all of which he’s scored for Tottenham. Should he return to his homeland in the summer after the 2026 World Cup, at the age of 33, he would have a prime chance of breaking the record.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann recently said Kane has a clause in his contract allowing him to leave next summer and backed Manchester United to sign him.",
      "He Adventure Gamers: “I think Harry Kane has a clause that allows him to leave for a certain amount next summer. I believe the reason Bayern Munich wanted to bring Nick Woltemade in this summer was because many within the club think Kane wants to go back to England after the World Cup.",
      "“I can see Harry Kane at Manchester United next season, and I think he’d do well for them,” Hamann added.",
      "“Having said that, I always felt that as a London boy, sometimes they don’t really like to go to the north. Having played for Spurs, obviously Chelsea and Arsenal might be tricky, but then again, you never know, if they give him a chance to win the Premier League.",
      "“I always felt or thought that a London club would be more favourable than a northern club, but obviously United is probably still the biggest club in England, and if they were to ask for his services, I think it would be fantastic to see him as their number nine.”",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",

      "Manchester United will reportedly push to sign Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which is bad news for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side targeted Baleba towards the end of the summer transfer window but showed no desire to meet Brighton’s £100million asking price after making an enquiry.",
      "The head coach was still strongly backed in the summer, with Man Utd spending over £200m on new signings, most notably revamping their attack with the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After spending big, the Red Devils turned their attention to outgoings in the final weeks of the window.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho both left on deadline day, but one player who stayed put despite speculation was Mainoo.",
      "READ: Man Utd told to get Southgate ‘in to restructure the whole place’ at Amorim’s expense",
      "There was intense chatter over his future after he was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games, with clubs ranging from Real Madrid to Tottenham linked. But the hierarchy, led by INEOS’ Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had no desire to let the England midfielder leave on loan.",
      "Since then, Mainoo has had limited minutes: 45 off the bench against Burnley, 28 against Manchester City, three against Chelsea, and the full Carabao Cup second-round defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has previously boiled p*ss by saying Mainoo is competing for Bruno Fernandes’ position in the team, rather than competing with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to play next to the Man Utd captain.",
      "Fernandes is not getting dropped, especially in his current form, and with Ugarte failing to impress and Casemiro suspended after his red card against Chelsea, the clamour to see Mainoo start is growing even stronger.",
      "But spending a club-record fee on Baleba would all but nail Mainoo’s Old Trafford coffin shut. While Baleba’s arrival might excite fans, their academy graduate is the last player they want sacrificed to make it happen.",
      "From a boardroom perspective, Mainoo can be sold for pure profit, a godsend for the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which only makes his potential departure more appealing.",
      "The prospect of losing him has already angered supporters, and if Football Insider is right that Man Utd will try again for Baleba in January, then the club are effectively willing to shove Mainoo out, whether deliberately or as collateral damage.",
      "The report in question states:",
      "Sources say that Ruben Amorim’s side are likely to go back in for the 21-year-old in January, and that speculation will increase again in the new year.",
      "However, United would struggle to complete a deal during the mid-season window due to Brighton’s reluctance to sell, and would have a better chance of signing the youngster next summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at over £100m… Despite this, the speculation is playing into the Red Devils’ hands, with the Cameroon international suffering a poor start to the season amid claims that his head has been turned.",
      "Indeed, Baleba’s head might well have been turned by the struggling Red Devils, and Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler suggested as much after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "“Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he’s a very young player,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“It’s all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there’s interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying, ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "“It’s even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.”",
      "Man Utd are prepared to allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window on one condition, according to reports.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘set’ their ‘price’ for academy product Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Real Madrid.",

      "Scholes said on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: “I really struggle to feel happy for Marcus Rashford.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful. The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave… His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.",

      "“For some reason, that seemed to rub certain people the wrong way. It seems like they’ve been waiting for me to have a human moment so they can point the finger and say, ‘See? See who he really is?’ – listen, I’m not a perfect person.",

      "It’s only September and we’ve all already got so much wrong about this season, from expecting an actual real-life title race like damn fools, to expecting the promoted teams to just meekly surrender as has become the style of our times.",
      "We feared for Bournemouth, like massive idiots, we thought Graham Potter just needed a pre-season, like even massiver idiots. We thought Man United would be a bit less sh*t this time.",
      "We thought Viktor Gyokeres would either fire Arsenal to the title or flop hard and the awkward bugger isn’t going to do either of those things.",
      "And let’s not even start on that ‘Chelsea title challenge’ we all talked about after the Trump World Cup.",
      "As always, you can see our pre-season predictions in full here. Laugh hard.",
      "",
      "So angry about this one already. Can’t fault Liverpool, can we? They’re doing their bit. Could hardly have looked more vulnerable if they’d tried, could they? But they’ve still accidentally won all their games despite falling entirely asleep the very moment they take a 2-0 lead.",
      "Meanwhile nobody else can even be bothered. Mikel Arteta is as timid as a tiny mouse with a suspiciously full head of hair, Pep Guardiola is cosplaying Jose Mourinho sufferball for reasons we simply cannot fathom, and Chelsea… well, we’ve got more to say about them later.",
      "Look, it’s obviously very early to be writing off the entire title race, and the main reason people are keen to do so now is in the hope they can call Liverpool bottle jobs later. They are objectively the worst very good team in Premier League history, and a lot of the teams who are better than them at this stage didn’t actually go on to win the league.",
      "But with everyone else shambling about to one extent or other and the sure and certain knowledge that Liverpool are only going to get better as they all get to know each other, it does appear like the best opportunity anyone else had to knock Liverpool off their perch this season was in these early weeks.",
      "It hasn’t happened, either through Liverpool dropping points or anyone else looking much like taking advantage if and when they do. And now it probably won’t happen. The sheer extent to which Arsenal already appear certain to finish second is truly extraordinary. World-class commitment to the bit.",
      "",
      "He is already the Premier League’s most fascinating player. Incredibly awkward, almost sarcastically un-Arsenal, and entirely incapable of fashioning or creating anything for himself, which means that in the big games where Arteta’s instinct is always going to be safety-first, Gyokeres isn’t going to get a kick. Like he didn’t against United, like he didn’t against Liverpool, like he didn’t against City.",
      "",
      "But what Gyokeres does have is an uncanny ability to stick the ball in the net. So in the games where Arteta takes off the handbrake – which across the course of the season will be a far higher percentage of games than has been the case in Arsenal’s undeniably difficult start – he’ll score a whole bunch of goals.",
      "It won’t stop people calling him a massive flop, because a lot of people seem weirdly invested in the idea of Gyokeres as a massive flop. The discourse around him is very strange, perhaps because he is such an awkward-looking player to watch. Nothing about the way he plays football screams £60m superstar in the way it does with, say, a Hugo Ekitike.",
      "He’s going to score loads of goals against all the teams that aren’t brilliant. So he’s not going to be a massive flop. Even now, the only Premier League player with more goals this season than Gyokeres is literally Erling Haaland.",
      "He is, though, going to get called a massive flop because he ‘hasn’t delivered in the big games’. He’s going to be labelled a ‘flat-track bully’ (like literally here). He’s going to be told he hasn’t done enough to shift the needle, because obviously there was no evidence last season that Arsenal might have benefited from someone to consistently score goals against teams like Bournemouth or West Ham or Newcastle or Everton or Brentford or Nottingham Forest or Aston Villa or Brighton or Crystal Palace or Fulham or, well, you get the idea with that.",
      "Above all, though, he’s going to be labelled a flop despite scoring 23 Premier League goals.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola, we owe you an apology, we weren’t really familiar with your game. We should have been, because he’s been performing minor Premier League miracles for a good while now with Bournemouth.",
      "But this is surely his greatest trick yet. Having built last season’s considerable success on the strength of his back five, Iraola has now seen four of that five stolen away by assorted members of European football’s collection of big bastards. Huijsen went to Real Madrid. Zabarnyi to PSG. Kerkez to Liverpool. And, to a lesser extent, Kepa to Arsenal.",
      "That was more than enough to place Bournemouth in the large pile of similarly asset-stripped smaller clubs about whom we had significant fear.",
      "We should have had more faith, because what Iraola has done is simply instantly build another brilliant team built on another excellent defence.",
      "A Spurs team that has scored at least twice in each of its four other Premier League games this season could barely muster a meaningful chance across 90 minutes where the sheer extent of the Cherries’ total control of proceedings was almost eerie.",
      "And that was no one-off fluke. Only Liverpool have more points after five games than a team that should by rights have been thoroughly broken by the events of the summer.",
      "And only Liverpool have beaten them, after a ding-dong opening-night battle at Anfield. Bournemouth conceded four goals that night, but have shipped only one since and an upcoming fixture list featuring Leeds, Fulham, Palace and Forest between now and the end of next month offers serious scope for continued defying of Premier League gravity.",
      "Right now they are Champions League-bound and it doesn’t even feel daft.",
      "",
      "Sure, it was often very bad indeed in those closing months of last season, but patience was needed. Potter is a details man, who needed to imprint his ideas and methods on to a squad not without its charms.",
      "As it turns out, he didn’t need that at all. What Graham Potter in fact needed was a time machine to go back to the day he took the Chelsea job and punch his past self squarely in the face and talk him out of committing career suicide.",
      "We’re almost certain there is now no chance Potter can save himself at West Ham specifically. It’s just too f*cked. What’s really wild, though, given where he was just a few short years ago is that we’re really not at all sure now how he goes about saving his career at all.",
      "Seriously, think about it. When the inevitable happens and the axe falls and West Ham appoint Gary O’Neil or Nuno to try and do just enough to avoid the ignominy of relegation, where does Potter go next? What’s his next step? Who takes a chance on him, and would he be at all interested in the sort of club that would do that anyway?",
      "He might be even more screwed in this equation than West Ham themselves, and that’s a club currently in some of the deepest despair we’ve ever seen, with a fanbase apparently only now able to agree on what they don’t want rather than what they do.",
      "That’s especially inconvenient because among those things are a terrible stadium and terrible owners that they appear rather stuck with.",
      "If you ask us, it all started to go wrong the moment the entire club tried for some reason we’ve never really understood to gaslight us all into pretending their previous much less soulless stadium had always been widely known as the Boleyn Ground and that nobody had ever called it Upton Park, actually.",
      "Seriously, why did they do that? What was the point?",
      "",
      "They won the Club World Cup! And to a less noteworthy degree the Europa Conference! They bought a load of good players again! And sold a lot of rubbish at very decent prices! But still forgot to sign an actual goalkeeper! Which is costing them really badly! And forcing Enzo Maresca to make the single worst collection of substitutions in any Premier League match ever!",
      "Ah, well. An undignified scrap with Spurs et al for fourth it shall be, then. And probably a managerial change as well. He’s just too bald.",
      "",
      "The Barclays giveth and the Barclays taketh away. While the Our League Gods have again, in their infinite wisdom, not deemed it fit to grant us a Proper Title Race they are seemingly going to grant us a good old-fashioned relegation ding-dong after all that promoted-and-immediately-relegated drudgery of the last two years.",
      "Two things were required to make this happen. Some of the Settled Seventeen looking a bit cack, and the promoted trio showing signs of competence.",
      "Happily, we have both. Even Burnley haven’t been entirely wretched, and along with Leeds and Sunderland they have now amassed 19 points from 15 games at 1.27 per game. It’s already pretty much a third of the total points tally the promoted-relegated trio managed last season at 0.57 points per game.",
      "Lovely stuff. And then throw in the catastrophic awfulness of Wolves, West Ham and even Aston Villa, with high potential for your Brentfords or even Nottingham Forests to get themselves into strife and we’ve got ourselves a proper scrap for survival.",
      "",
      "Worth its own section for the sheer scale of its wrongness. But accustomed as we’d come to seeing promoted sides struggle horribly and armed with the fact that Sunderland looked like a textbook example of a team committing the disastrous error of accidentally winning the play-offs at least a year too early in their process, it was easy to imagine they might have a Southampton-esque tilt at the Premier League’s ultimate wooden spoon.",
      "Technically they still might, of course, but we’re not afraid to admit that on the balance of probabilities a Sunderland team that has managed eight points from its first five games will probably manage to scrape together at least another four from the remaining 33.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure what there is now, because at least two members of the supposed six have been clowning about for a good while now, but what we have all been given is a reminder that you can’t just elevate anyone else you feel like into that Big X territory on the back of a couple of good seasons in and around the top six.",
      "It was a lesson that should have been learned with Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester and one that is now being delivered again by Unai Emery’s Aston Villa.",
      "Newcastle are a slightly different matter because there is still the potential for them to work out means and ways of spending themselves into elite security, but they definitely aren’t there yet.",
      "It really is worth remembering that for all their impeccable banter-club credentials, Spurs’ elevation alongside the more obviously compelling Man City gatecrashing of the old Big Four was based on far, far more than a mere couple of decent seasons on the pitch.",
      "We’ve also just now noticed that Spurs now have exactly 1961 Premier League points, which is nice for them.",
      "",
      "Turns out they are just as bad, except against teams that make a series of unfathomably stupid decisions in the opening 21 minutes.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains really quite alarmingly committed to a formation that doesn’t work with a squad that doesn’t suit it, and is now openly goading the dafties he appointed him into sacking him if they don’t like it.

      "We’re five games into the Premier League season and some of the fears over big summer signings are being realised.",
      "All of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal appear to have made striker blunders, while Chelsea have signed a downgrade and Newcastle can’t get better than Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is a ‘flat-track bully’ \nThe major concern having watched Gyokeres plunder a gazillion goals for Sporting was whether he could match or even get near those goalscoring heights against superior opposition in the Premier League. The stats are damning.",
      "He’s scored three in five games so far, two against newly promoted Leeds and the third against a Nottingham Forest side whose manager had been in place for about four minutes. Not only has he failed to score against Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City, he’s accrued an xG of 0.0 in those three games.",
      "Mikel Arteta says Gyokeres is “trying his best”, bless him, and we assume the Arsenal boss will continue to insist a lack of service is to blame until Kai Havertz returns to fitness and replaces the Swede for these big games.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens is a Noni Madueke downgrade\nIt doesn’t say much for Gittens’ standing five games into his career at Chelsea that at no point amid Enzo Maresca’s irrational substitutions against Manchester United on Saturday was there any great dismay at him failing to turn to the £48.5m winger to get them back into the game. At least Alejandro Garnacho was on the verge of being introduced before being snubbed in favour of Tyrique George and Malo Gusto.",
      "He looks like a man who doesn’t truly believe he should be there, in many ways the antithesis of Madueke, who may not have set the world alight at Stamford Bridge, but never lacked for confidence. And after his fine start at Arsenal, it feels as though Chelsea have simply nurtured, developed and improved one winger to aid their Premier League rivals and replaced him with another at the start of that journey, very possibly without the same self-belief to take those positive steps forward.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz is too lightweight\nWhile we totally understand why he’s been targeted and have absolutely jumped on the bandwagon, Wirtz has not been half as bad as the Liverpool-baiting media and fan responses to his performances would suggest.",
      "As much as anything, we all just need a stick to beat the Premier League champions-elect with right now, and much of the criticism is based around the fear of just how f***ed everyone else is when he and Liverpool actually start playing well. We’re getting the jabs in while we still can.",
      "A common slam is how easily he appears to get knocked off the ball. And he does look lightweight, but we are now all looking for examples which we’re guessing could be found by analysing the footage of plenty of Premier League No.10s. We don’t particularly remember Phil Foden or James Maddison bullying their way through opposition challenges, for example.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the new Rasmus Hojlund\nThere has perhaps been no greater sign of just how far the Manchester United stock has fallen than their fans batting away criticism of their new £67m striker after he was hooked at half-time in the victory over Chelsea by extolling the virtues of an Andy Carroll-esque flick-on from a long punt up the pitch.",
      "That was one of eight touches for Sesko in a half of football against 10 men in which he completed three passes, had no shots and didn’t attempt a dribble. He’s had five shots in 207 minutes of Premier League football. We know what you’re thinking – if only he was getting the service. Sound familiar?",
      "",
      "Liverpool don’t need Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak\nAs great headaches for a manager go, the struggle to choose between a striker who’s already got four goals and an assist and the most expensive Premier League signing of all time is a real doozy.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Slot “has to play” Ekitike after his fine start to life at Anfield, but although we would all revel in Isak continuing to watch Liverpool games rather than playing in them after escaping that whole-season reality on deadline day, Slot also sort of has to play him, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze is not a left winger\nWe don’t suppose Arsenal fans care all that much which left winger changed the game and secured victory in their Champions League opener before scoring an equaliser against their title rivals in the very next game, but you would have got pretty long odds on that player being Gabriel Martinelli at the start of the summer transfer window. Nico Williams or Rodrygo may have been more likely.",
      "Martinelli wouldn’t still be at Arsenal if they had received a good enough offer for the Brazilian, but still looks like their best bet on the left wing over Eze, very simply because Martinelli is a left winger and Eze is not.",
      "Arteta should accept Havertz-esque defeat now.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga isn’t worth £55m\nOur suggestion that Elanga may not be worth £55m to anyone else but is to Newcastle was predicated on him being able to replicate something similar to what he did for Nottingham Forest last season for his new club.",
      "Having started the first two games of the season he’s taken up a spot on the bench for the last three, which makes us wonder just how good a right winger Newcastle need to sign in order to one day displace Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens is not a No.1\nAsked whether Altay Bayindir is now his No.1 goalkeeper having started every Premier League game so far this season, Amorim insisted “nobody has a place that is his place”. He may very well have said the same thing had Manchester United signed Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, but either one of them would now definitely be in the starting XI.",
      "Bayindir may grow into the role and prove himself capable, but no right-minded United fan will have any real hope of that being the case, and they may currently be wondering why their club has spent 18 million precious pounds on a back-up goalkeeper who we can only assume is at best a minor improvement on the man currently tending goal.",
      "Scoring a tap-in against Southampton in the League Cup is the same as a last-minute winner at the Bernabeu right?",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "That was very stupid from Hugo Ekitike and he deserves all the criticism coming his way from Liverpool fans and others.",

      "Scott McTominay is officially the 18th best player in world football. He’s better than Jude Bellingham. He’s better than Erling Haaland. He’s better than Virgil van Dijk. He’s sure as sh*t better than any Manchester United player.",
      "Perhaps Rio Ferdinand should reflect on how after one season away from Old Trafford, he’s better than Declan Rice and only slightly worse than Harry Kane, who may not have been the pairing to cure all of United’s ills after all.",
      "In fairness to Ferdinand, he was against United selling McTominay to Napoli, although his steady Eddie reasoning hasn’t aged well after the Scot was named Serie A MVP in his debut season under Antonio Conte.",
      "“I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player,” Ferdinand said. “But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher.",
      "“They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that. It really doesn’t sit well with me.",
      "“With McTominay you know what you’re getting. He might not always be a nine out of 10 but invariably he’s a solid seven out of 10 and sometimes he will be an eight out of 10 and get you a goal.”",
      "But the pundit recently fell into a trap which has claimed many a Manchester United stakeholder in the last decade or so, in claiming that issues can be solved by spending a couple of hundred million on two very good footballers.",
      "“I honestly think and I’m convinced that if Man United would have got Harry Kane and Declan Rice in that window, they’re in a different place now. It goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment I think because they’re two top pros.”",
      "There’s no doubt that Kane and Rice improve Manchester United, but Tottenham finished eighth in Kane’s last season for them despite his 30 goals in that campaign. Rice led West Ham to the Conference League title but a 14th-place Premier League finish. There’s only so much one man can do for a football club failing to meet expectations, or in this specific Ferdinand-imagined case, what two men can do at Manchester United.",
      "And based on the admittedly arbitrary Ballon d’Or ranking of all footballers in every position which sees McTominay placed between Rice in 27th and Kane in 13th, neither of those potential saviours would have had anything like the impact for the Red Devils that they’re currently having at Arsenal and Bayern Munich respectively.",

      "Almost as soon as Josh King’s blind, misplaced pass led to Brentford’s opening goal he had Alex Iwobi provide an arm around the shoulder and some conciliatory words.",
      "When King was then booked on the stroke of half-time after Fulham had recovered to take the lead, the easy call for Marco Silva would have been to take him off to prevent the worst-case scenario unfolding, albeit at great expense to an 18-year-old’s confidence.",
      "But the decision to keep him on was inspired and rewarded. “Tonight will make him grow better,” said an “impressed” Silva of a player who “wanted to ball back in his feet” even after the mistake.",

      "The concern over their attacking output is warranted and Eddie Howe was right to point out that “evolving into a different team” may “take a bit of time”.",

      "Only Manchester United (1997/98), Chelsea (2005/06), Portsmouth (2006/07) and Manchester City (2015/16) have kept more clean sheets in the first five games of a Premier League season. It is something to cling to.",

      "Managers rarely if ever truly recover from “You don’t know what you’re doing” and “You’re getting sacked in the morning” chants from their own supporters; the substitution of Mateus Fernandes for Soungoutou Magassa – and not James Ward-Prowse – was merely the breaking point the inside stories of his inevitable sacking needed.",
      "But the suggestion is that West Ham will naturally botch that, giving Potter the Everton and Arsenal games before the international break as they feel it would be too difficult a start for a new coach.",
      "And said coach will be an interim appointment for about 30 games, with the obvious choice being the only manager Potter has beaten this season.",

      "The last line in particular felt incongruous, capturing the sense of defeatism which has engulfed Aston Villa since last season’s final day, underpinned their entire summer transfer window and bled into this campaign.",
      "Whatever the issues beyond PSR, they have extended from boardrooms to the dressing room and pitch. And Unai Emery, the greatest manager in the club’s history in terms of win percentage, seems incapable of solving them.",
      "His branding of these players as “lazy” and lacking “confidence” and “personality” feels like a crossroads. It goes one of two ways, either sparking a necessary period of collective and individual self-analysis or feeding into what seems to be a sort of victim mentality which has been allowed to fester at Villa Park.",
      "There is an increasing divide between those backing Emery and others who believe him to be the problem and removing him at least part of the solution.",
      "It has been an unfathomable spiral from that potentially transformative week in April when Southampton, Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle were all dispatched to the tune of ten goals. An inability to pinpoint any one broken thing is not helping, and the worst may well be yet to come.",
      "",
      "They do appear to know each other almost too well, Clive. And perhaps it should come as no surprise that the king of overthinking has imprinted some of those ideals onto his finest student.",
      "The stakes in these games are high and the reaction to the results and performances so ubiquitous that both managers did seem consumed by the consequences of a potential defeat rather than the advantages of a possible victory.",
      "Arteta forced Guardiola into a historically low amount of possession and became the first manager to ever go five league games unbeaten against the Spaniard.",
      "Guardiola compelled Arteta to pick a starting line-up focused more on stifling a relatively weak opposition at an inevitable cost to Arsenal’s own attacking strengths, as underlined by the Gunners’ two half-time changes.",
      "Neither manager really needed to react how they did to the perceived obstacles they faced, but the pressure of a heavy summer of investment already manifesting in an imposing gap to the leaders is bound to tell.",

      "There is something to be commended in Wolves going against the grain and extending their manager’s contract after starting the season with four consecutive defeats, having ended the last with three losses and a draw.",
      "But when that attempt to manufacture positivity manifests itself in a home defeat to a relegation rival having led from the eighth minute, it only feels like Wolves and Vitor Pereira are trying to convince themselves this could work.",
      "Jeff Shi extolled the virtues of “stability” and giving Pereira “time to work with the squad, to build a chemistry with new players”, but Marie Curie and Dmitri Mendeleev would struggle on that front as co-managers.",
      "A mere glance at that Wolves starting line-up is enough to conclude they do not have nearly enough of the requisite quality or experience. Sa; Agbadou, Mosquera, T. Gomes; Tchatchoua, J. Gomes, Krejci, R. Gomes; Lopez, Bellegarde; Arokodare is just a collection of random letters with no semblance of cohesion or identity.",

      "It might actually be a decent consolation to keep such company with Casemiro, but the player Manchester United identified as the Brazilian’s £100m successor is hardly taking advantage of the continued midfield mess at Old Trafford.",
      "Baleba has now been substituted at half-time in two of those starts, while being taken off in the quadruple substitution which triggered that exceptional win over Manchester City.",
      "Against Spurs it was he who surrendered possession in the build-up to the first goal and while Fabian Hurzeler ought to engage in a little more introspection when it comes to carelessly dropping points when leading at home, the manager was right in his assessment of Baleba: he’s “not a machine” and it’s Brighton’s “responsibility” to help him.",
      "",
      "An inability to see out games has been a consistent issue for Brentford these past couple of seasons. No team dropped more points from winning positions than their 30 in 2023/24, and last season only four had a worse record when ahead.",
      "This season has seen Brentford already drop as many points from winning positions (eight) as in the entirety of their first campaign in the Premier League. What was once a key strength has become a glaring weakness.",
      "And the problem with appointing a continuity candidate with no prior senior management experience is that they will struggle to change those aspects of a club’s identity. Indeed, the nature of his promotion only encouraged Brentford to maintain rather than evolve.",
      "In the face of adversity these players will lean into the long throws, the set-pieces and back fives because it’s what they know. But there remains doubt as to whether Andrews has the tactical acumen to override that muscle memory and imprint his own style.",
      "",
      "That is 58 visits to Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United in the Premier League without a single win, obviously only propagated by Everton having just three extra minutes in which they could at no point look like scoring.",
      "It is honestly a remarkable achievement. Jesse Marsch, Ian Holloway and Mick McCarthy have all won at Anfield – and they aren’t even in the top five such cases which should embarrass Moyes the most.",

      "Winless in his last ten domestic games, with those European escapades in between pretty much the entire justification behind him landing a job which could not have been more plum if it came with its own candlestick and billiard room.",
      "Postecoglou is at least under no illusions of the need to deliver the sort of immediate results which have eluded him in his first three games, even when trying to accomplish the Brendan Rodgers holy grail of trying to dismantle and rebuild an aircraft in a completely new way while it is somehow still flying and being backseat-piloted by a large angry Greek billionaire.",
      "And nine times out of ten that performance would have been good enough for a win. But it does not take a vivid imagination to see how games against Real Betis, Sunderland, Midtjylland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto and Bournemouth cause things to suddenly spiral before November.",
      "Scoring a tap-in against Southampton in the League Cup is the same as a last-minute winner at the Bernabeu right?",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "Arteta went for caution again against Manchester City and while that formula could work in the Champions League, it will never be a success in the Premier League.",
      "Mikel Arteta has revealed that the senior Arsenal players initially wanted to “kick” Max Dowman in training after displaying his tricks.",
      "That was very stupid from Hugo Ekitike and he deserves all the criticism coming his way from Liverpool fans and others.",
      "Liverpool are flying in spite of Alisson underperforming – according to the stats – while James Trafford’s reward for the best numbers is the bench."

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",

      "“His legs have been questioned, but go back to that game yesterday and it’s not all about that, they had plenty of possession. Bruno Fernandes can be fine in central midfield when he has hold of the ball.",
      "“When you are playing against better teams, there are times when you’re not going to have the ball, and that’s when you have to know the position brilliantly. Every manager is clever these days, and Pep is the very best at getting people in behind his midfield. He had Foden doing it and Bernardo doing it.",
      "“He had Doku coming inside. I’ve been there myself, you’re constantly looking over your shoulder, thinking where is my man, it’s a horrible place to be at times. If you’re on the ball all the time, then Fernandes is brilliant [in deeper midfield].",
      "“Now Kobbie Mainoo is the same I think on the ball, he can be fantastic, but he needs a proper partner next to him. I don’t think Ugarte… he’s got the legs but doesn’t have the quality.",
      "“We know Casemiro had the quality over the years but he’s slowed down now. Again, I look at my career, I wasn’t the greatest in that position, I didn’t know it brilliantly well, but the guy next to me always did.",
      "“They knew it so well, Roy Keane, Nicky Butt and Michael Carrick, they were perfect for me. I don’t think the partnership is working for any of them because they don’t know the position as well as they should.”",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that England international is likely to “force a move” away from Old Trafford in January.",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘set’ their ‘price’ for academy product Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Real Madrid.",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome."

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Even after five wins from five games there is a small yet irritatingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Finally managed to win a game without needing a dramatic late goal against Everton, but didn’t quite put to bed those ‘weirdly flaky when 2-0 up’ allegations, either.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what four defeats in the opening five games will do to you after a summer where little went right for West Ham.",
      "Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. Then any hint of renewed optimism was dashed by grim  flaw-exposing defeats to Tottenham and Crystal Palace.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "Teddy Sheringham reckons United should do away with Ruben Amorim and bring in Gareth Southgate who could fix the place up a bit.",
      "Man Utd have finalised a three-man shortlist to replace Ruben Amorim if the Red Devils decide to sack the Portuguese coach, according to reports.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Paul Merson has made a prediction relating to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, while Wayne Rooney has raised one “big question” about the game vs Chelsea."

      "Plus: Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner leaves Graham Potter on the brink at West Ham; Spurs show fight in Brighton comeback; Noah Okafor inspires Leeds' victory over winless Wolves; Nottingham Forest see the good and the bad of Ange Postecoglou",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited the training ground to meet with Ruben Amorim this week following their poor start to the season; Amorim: \"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win\"",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",
