      "Manchester United are one of the teams said to have bid for Sheffield Wednesday's Yisa Alao. (Image: James Fearn, Getty Images)",
      "Liverpool and Manchester United could miss out on signing Sheffield Wednesday's promising left-back Yisa Alao, as Chelsea are reportedly preparing to swoop in. The 17-year-old has been making a name for himself in the Championship with his recent performances for the struggling club.",
      "Both Liverpool and Manchester United have already tabled offers for the young talent, according to the Daily Mail. However, they may face stiff competition from Chelsea, who are rumoured to be ready to outbid their rivals.",
      "Alao has made his way into Sheffield Wednesday's first team this season and has been offered his first professional contract. Yet, he seems hesitant to commit to Hillsborough, leaving the door open for other clubs to step in.",
      "While Liverpool's bid remains undisclosed, it's reported that United have put forward around £400,000 plus significant add-ons. Chelsea, on the other hand, are said to be gearing up to offer £600,000, along with substantial performance-related bonuses as per the same report.",
      "Alao's decision will likely hinge on the career opportunities that the interested clubs can provide. His rise at Sheffield Wednesday comes amidst a period of instability for the club.",
      "The Owls were plunged into administration last October and have been hit with an 18-point deduction by the EFL. The financial turmoil has also resulted in unpaid wages and the club having to rely on young players to fulfil their Championship fixtures.",
      "A consortium spearheaded by James Bord has been chosen as the preferred bidder, bringing a takeover one step closer. The process is now awaiting final approval.",
      "Currently, Wednesday find themselves languishing at the bottom of the Championship table, with a dismal -7 points. Alao has been handed an opportunity following Harry Amass' return to Manchester United.",
      "The left-back spent the first half of the season on loan with the Owls, where he impressed with his performances. He has since returned to Old Traffor,d where a decision will be made over his short-term future.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Wednesday are keen to extend the deal to the end of the season. But they face competition from other Championship clubs who are expected to be able to offer a better financial package to United.",
      "Alao made his first senior appearance in the FA Cup third-round match against Brentford earlier this month. He was then selected for the starting XI in last weekend's Championship game against Portsmouth.",
      "Liverpool and United, meanwhile, have had a quiet transfer window thus far. Defender Mor Talla Ndiaye is the sole new recruit at Anfield this month, with the 18-year-old set to link up with the club's U21 team as he continues his development.",
      "Players such as Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa have been rumoured to be on their way out but a move this month seems some way off at present. So far, the only confirmed departure at Liverpool is young talent James Norris, who moved to Shelbourne on New Year's Day.",
      "United haven't been involved in any January deals yet, with no incomings and no outgoings. Toby Colleyer's return from his loan at West Brom is the only thing of note that has been confirmed this month, despite persistent rumours linking United with the likes of Ruben Neves, Joao Gomes, Yan Dimonade and Barcelona star Marc Casado.",

Michael Carrick, currently holding the reins at Old Trafford on an interim basis, got off to a flying start with a 2-0 victory over Manchester City.",

      "\"The Simeone one is really interesting,\" he commented. \"We've just had a chat about DNA. But it's interesting that Roy, who loves the club, and Gary, the same, have both mentioned Diego Simeone at different points in the last 4 or 5 months, that they wouldn't mind seeing him at Man United.",

      "David Beckham sacked close friend Phil Neville as Inter Miami manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "One of the lesser-seen obstacles for a football club owner comes when you're forced to deliver bad news to a close friend. That's what happened to David Beckham at Inter Miami when the time came to tell Phil Neville he was getting sacked as manager.",
      "Beckham and Neville were the best of friends during their playing days at Manchester United, breaking into the first team in the 1990s after both coming through United's academy. The pair were reunited in Florida after Beckham took ownership of the club, with Neville appointed as manager for their second Major League Soccer season in 2021.",
      "Inter Miami finished 11th in the Eastern Conference in Neville's first season at the helm, despite boasting talents including World Cup-winning midfielder Blaise Matuidi and former Real Madrid and Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain. They made the post-season play-offs in 2022 but lost to New York City in the first round.",
      "Neville was granted a number of new signings in the close season, including former MLS top scorer Josef Martinez. Results didn't improve, though, leaving Beckham with a tough decision to make.",
      "\"Football management is temporary, we know at some point you're going to be moved on. That was my reason for being nervous when you took that job,\" Neville's older brother Gary told his sibling on It's Called Soccer! in 2024. \"Did you think about that at the beginning or did you just see it as an unbelievable opportunity?\"",
      "Phil replied: \"[It was] both, really. The big thing is that you're not just losing a football game but you feel like you're letting a friend down as well. Becks is really strong, he doesn't buckle and he's really loyal to the people he's close to.\"",
      "When reflecting on his sacking specifically, he said: \"The day I actually got fired was probably actually harder for David than it was for me. He really didn't want to do it, he was really emotional. I was emotional too but I knew it was coming so it was probably easier for me.\"",
      "Beckham's Inter Miami franchise would go on to win MLS Cup without Neville in 2025(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Inter Miami had won just five of their first 15 league games when Beckham approved a change of manager. Tata Martino took over midway through the 2023 season, when even the summer additions of Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets weren't enough to drag them back into the play-offs.",
      "It was a different story in 2024, though, with Martino leading the team to the Supporters' Shield - awarded to the team that finishes top in the regular season - but falling short in the play-offs. His successor, Javier Mascherano, finally delivered the club a first MLS Cup triumph in 2025.",
      "Phil Neville wasn't deterred from pursuing his managerial dream by the way things ended in Miami. He took over at Portland Timbers just months later and has led the club to the play-offs in each of his first two seasons.",

      "In the context of the achievements of many big clubs, United’s performances have not been great over the past decade or so, but they have not been disastrous. Their average finishing position in the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson left has been between fifth and sixth and they have won a couple of FA Cups, the EFL Cup twice and a Europa League.",

      "They are ex-United players. They played for the famous institution. They know what it is like. That is why their views are in demand.",

      "In the case of Scholes and Nicky Butt, you could add that they are also fans of the club. But now, it seems, a lot of opinion - certainly on social media - is turning against the swathe of former Old Trafford favourites who have been less than complimentary about United.",
      "If it is a shift in attitude, it has probably been hastened by Keane’s comments about the Michael Carrick appointment and by the Scholes and Butt digs at Lisandro Martinez, to which the defender duly responded after his fine contribution to United’s derby win. The Scholes and Butt comments were a bit immature - and subsequently proven to be ill-advised - but they were hardly vicious.",
      "Martinez was entitled to respond and did so in a nicely pointed manner. It was good knockabout stuff.",
      "But the serious element in the Martinez comments was him saying that when it came to critical comments from ex-players, he is not bothered either way. That is exactly the way it should be. Criticism does not motivate him, nor does it demoralise him.",
      "Lisandro Martinez reacted angrily to negative comments from Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt(Image: )",
      "Ex-players should be allowed to say exactly what they want. This is not North Korea. What do we want the likes of Keane, Scholes and Butt to be? Cheerleaders?",
      "Gary Neville does some of that and he also does a lot of the critical stuff. And that is fine. If these guys are happy when United win and are annoyed when they lose, fine.",
      "They are ex-players, they have a strong connection with the club. Most of them are fans. To the many who are not United fans, it can become grating, for sure.",
      "But it should have no negative effect on the team. Because, seriously, if you let the paid-for jibes of a few pundits damage your game - and Martinez clearly didn’t, by the way - you don’t belong at Manchester United.",

Cascado's future at the Camp Nou is under scrutiny after finding his minutes limited under Hansi Flick, managing a series of cameo appearances in his 19 outings so far.",
      "But he has been left frustrated with his last league outing coming in the final 11 minutes during the 2-0 win over Villarreal.

      "Manchester United have been urged not to make Oliver Glasner their next manager following claims the job would be \"too big\" for him. United are currently on the hunt for a new permanent boss after sacking Ruben Amorim earlier this month.",
      "While Michael Carrick enjoyed an ideal start to life as the club's interim manager, Crystal Palace coach Glasner is among the names tipped to be Amorim's long-term replacement. The Austrian announced last week that he would be leaving the Eagles at the end of the season when his current contract expires.",
      "Glasner's position was placed under the spotlight further following Palace's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland in the Premier League as he slammed the club's decision to sell Marc Guehi to Manchester City. However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has questioned whether Glasner's success at Palace could realistically translate to Old Trafford.",
      "The ex-West Brom and Wrexham stopper also voiced concerns over tactical fit, warning Glasner could face the same issues Amorim encountered by sticking to his preferred system.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"He's the favourite to go and get the Man United job, but I just don’t think it would work out for him. I think it's too big a job.

      "Glasner fired shots at Palace bosses on Saturday, just days after announcing his intention to step down at the end of the season.",
      "He said: \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this. We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week?",

      "Quizzed over whether he might leave before the end of the campaign, he said: \"I don't know. I always have a huge appreciation for this group of players. I completely trust them. Their character is exceptional and we will stick together and turn around.",
      "\"I will never step back because these players deserve Oliver Glasner as their manager and leader and this is what I will do. Sometimes it would help if we had a little bit of support.\"",

      "David Beckham was one subject of his son Brooklyn's explosive statement(Image: Getty)",
      "David Beckham has been the subject of a scathing statement from his son, Brooklyn, who accused his father of controlling him, among other things. But the Manchester United icon's own Father's Day message from last summer says a lot.",
      "Since his 2022 marriage to actress Nicola Peltz, the Beckham family's eldest, Brooklyn, seemingly kept his distance from parents Victoria and David amid suggestions that a familial rift had formed. Their attendance or lack thereof at Victoria's 50th birthday and then David's caused quite the stir.",
      "This week, Brooklyn broke his silence in a mic-dropping fashion, releasing a six-page statement on social media filled with allegations. He claims his mother \"hijacked\" his and Peltz's wedding and that his parents have long been controlling his life.",
      "Brooklyn included in his statement that he does not wish to reconcile with his family, including father David, but the former England star posted his own statement with a vastly different tone just last year.",
      "In June 2025, Beckham took to Instagram with a picture of his four children on Father's Day and accompanied it with a heartfelt caption, which acted as a message to his kids.",
      "\"My most important and favourite job in life is being a dad,\" he wrote. \"I'm so proud of all of you and like daddy (sorry boys) tells you every single day, I will always be here for you no matter what…\"",
      "But Brooklyn apparently sees things a little differently. The 26-year-old included in his statement details of a disagreement over naming rights, and he claims both Victoria and David have been off with him since.",
      "The Beckham family has been broken apart(Image: Getty)",
      "\"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped,\" wrote Brooklyn. \"Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.",
      "\"They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since.\"",
      "Brooklyn also alleges that during his father's 50th birthday celebrations in the summer of 2025, David refused to see him unless his wife Nicola was excluded.",
      "Brooklyn married Peltz in 2022(Image: Getty)",
      "David's eldest continued: \"We travelled to London for my dad's birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him.",
      "\"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner. When he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn't invited. It was a slap in the face.",
      "\"My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand has given his verdict(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has accused former Manchester United team-mates Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt of crossing the line by getting 'personal' in their criticism of Lisandro Martinez. The defender had been mocked by Scholes and Butt in the build-up to Saturday's Manchester derby.",
      "\"[Erling] Haaland would score, then throw him [Martinez] in the net,\" Scholes joked. Butt quipped: \"Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him, you know, when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler\".",
      "Martinez, 28, ended up keeping a clean sheet as United won 2-0, with Haaland's second-half substitution after an anonymous performance the icing on the cake. The Argentina international said post-match that he didn't 'care' about Scholes and Butt's comments, and invited them to his house to deal with the matter face-to-face.",
      "The pair responded, with Butt telling Martinez to 'grow the f*** up' on their podcast, The Good, The Bad & The Football. Scholes, who said that he'd previously exchanged messages with Martinez but hasn't heard anything since he gave him his phone number, added: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.\"",

      "Now Ferdinand has weighed in on their comments. \"It's not beef, I think it's being made out to be beef,\" he began on Rio Ferdinand Presents. \"I think there has been this week some stuff that has probably been just over borderline, personal.",
      "\"I've spoken to Martinez a few times, face-to-face and online, and do you know what? He's someone who just wants to do well, he's someone who just wants to win, he's someone who just wants to get back to the standards that Man United were at.",
      "\"He's eager to understand what that looks like. He's even invited me to come into the training ground, to go for a coffee, whatever, just to sit.",
      "\"I think he's a sponge; he wants to work, he wants to learn. The way he plays, I feel, is the way he is, and he's an honest character and a good sort to have in the changing room it seems from what I hear from people around the place as well.",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have made headlines(Image: DARREN STAPLES/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"I think he's within his rights, if something's got on his nerves and he's come out and said it. The way it's been taken, I think, is probably a bit out of context.",
      "\"I don't think he's saying, 'Listen, come meet me anywhere and we'll have a tear up' - I think he's saying, 'Come on, let's have a conversation. Let's talk face-to-face, let's talk it out. If you've got an issue, let's talk about it'.",
      "\"I think he's straight as you like like that. Baring in mind, we're talking about a World Cup winner here, so he knows how to win. I had a conversation with him after the game and I think he was very just quick and clear: 'We've got a standard now, we need to gather momentum'.",

      "\"For someone in their second language, he was spot on with what he's saying. He's always wanted to have conversations with people, he's always been open to that.",
      "\"What I would say is, I think when you're talking about people, as long as you feel you could say the same thing in front of them, and you'd be happy to say it in front of them with your chest out, then it's fair game.\"",

      "Brooklyn Beckham has finally addressed the long-suggested rift with his parents, David and Victoria, in a scathing six-page statement. And a decision once made by the 26-year-old provides an insight into his severed relationship with his father.",
      "It had long been suggested that Brooklyn and wife Nicola Peltz had become estranged from the iconic family on the back of their 2022 wedding. Neither Brooklyn nor Peltz attended Victoria's 50th birthday and both were absent as Manchester United and England icon David received a knighthood. Another 50th birthday faux pas and some social media blocking followed.",
      "On Monday, the footballer's son finally broke his silence, releasing a lengthy, volatile statement that included a string of accusations. Brooklyn claims his parents controlled most of his life, and his wedding was \"hijacked\" by his mother. He explained explicitly: \"I do not want to reconcile with my family.\"",
      "But earlier in his childhood, Brooklyn made the decision not to follow his father into football, and David's response says a lot about the amicable relationship the two once shared.",
      "At the age of 15, Brooklyn decided he would not emulate his father by becoming a professional footballer. Having been part of Arsenal's academy, he stepped away from football in 2014.",
      "Since then, Brooklyn has pursued a career in modelling as well as photography, but David admitted in a 2015 interview that it broke his heart to learn the reason why his eldest left the game.",
      "\"One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, 'Daddy, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time,'\" he told ABC. \"It broke my heart a little bit.",
      "Brooklyn quit football at 15(Image: Getty)",
      "\"He said, 'Every time I went to the field, I know people are saying, This is David Beckham's son,' and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.'\"",
      "This affectionate response was mirrored by Brooklyn in 2022 when he spoke to Variety. The United icon's son admitted he was \"sad\" to give up football but insisted his father just wanted him to be happy.",
      "\"My dad wasn't sad, because he was like, 'I just want you to be happy,'\" said Brooklyn. \"But of course, I was sad. It was my whole life since I was literally two.\"",
      "This father-son bond has now been well and truly detached on the back of Brooklyn's eruptive statement, in which he painted a very different picture of his father.",
      "Alongside other allegations, Brooklyn wrote: \"For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.",
      "The 26-year-old renewed his vows with Peltz in 2025(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.",

      "Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick has implemented a new rule already(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick could reverse three bans that predecessor Ruben Amorim implemented at Manchester United before his sacking. Old Trafford legend Carrick took over from caretaker manager Darren Fletcher last week, stepping in as United’s interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "It came after Amorim was dismissed from his position as head coach 14 months into his tenure, having struggled to implement his tactical ideas effectively and seemingly fallen out with United’s director of football, Jason Wilcox, over transfers.",
      "Carrick in his first game in charge led the Red Devils to a dominant 2-0 win over Manchester City, with the performance reminiscent of the teams he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. United appeared a completely different side after just three days of training under their new boss, notably defending with intensity and using wing-play to devastating effect.",
      "That may be thanks to a new rule Carrick quickly introduced after taking the reins. According to the Daily Mail, the 44-year-old has made training sessions at Carrington shorter but more intense in an effort to improve results this season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The response from the players is said to have been positive and it was 'immediately clear' from the first session that there was a different energy on the pitch. The squad were also introduced to the new coaching team, made up of Steve Holland - who arrived as Carrick's No.2 - along with Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans as first‑team coaches.",
      "There is said to be a strong blend of skill sets and personalities within the staff, and a 'positive dynamic' already appears to be forming. Training has also placed greater emphasis on individual work with specific players and the squad are thought to be impressed by the level of detail involved.",
      "It is unknown whether Carrick has scrapped the three bans previously implemented by Amorim when the Portuguese took charge or whether he has stuck with them. One of Amorim’s non-negotiables at United was the banning of players using international breaks as holiday opportunities, with Marcus Rashford and Casemiro notably drawing criticism for travelling across the Atlantic when they had only been given a few days off training to rest.",
      "Speaking about the incident, Amorim said: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash or Case.",
      "Ruben Amorim's non-negotiables didn't bring success(Image: Nick Potts/PA Wire)",
      "\"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, emphasising the need to improve his squad's physical fitness. Amorim admitted very early on it was \"impossible\" to win the Premier League with a team that doesn’t run.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won’t win,\" he said. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won’t win.\"",
      "Manchester United looked rejuvenated in Carrick's first game in charge(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The third rule he implemented was directed at his coaches, banning them from giving out complicated instructions to his players. The former Sporting CP boss believed that if he couldn’t explain a particular idea in a single sentence, it shouldn't be communicated until it's simplified.",
      "It was claimed that the approach initially went down well with the players, given the ‘clarity’ of his instructions. But that did not appear to help in practice as his players struggled to adapt to his 3-4-3 formation even after a year in charge.",
      "It seems the players have had no such issue with taking Carrick’s instructions on board, however, given their impressive display in the Manchester Derby. They will face an even tougher test with a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, where they will face league leaders Arsenal.",

Michael Carrick kicked off his temporary stint in charge with a 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The ex-midfielder is set to leave at end of the season, with the club planning to bring in a permanent head coach. However, the triumph over City has already sparked chatter about Carrick securing the role full-time.",

Carragher sifted through, ruling out names such as Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner, and Xavi. When the dust settled, only four contenders remained: Julian Nagelsmann, Tuchel, Luis Enrique, and Eddie Howe.",
      "Discussing Howe, who has been backed to come in by Roy Keane, he said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. I think the type of football that you see from Newcastle at their best - high energy, pressing and in the future - that's not just Manchester United, that's a lot of top clubs and how they want to play.",

      "Manchester United used to be a club with a siege gun attitude. It was them against the world. Gary Neville, of all people, made a point of encouraging new signings not to talk to the press.",
      "And while Sir Alex Ferguson often used the media to his own advantage, he wouldn't think twice about being economical with the truth either.",
      "Even if it left him with egg on his face. Back in 2012, Fergie sat in a press conference in Cape Town during a United pre-season tour of the United States, and flat out denied he had signed Robin Van Persie from Arsenal.",
      "What he didn't know was at that exact moment, however, his own club had announced the signing on their official website. Oops.",
      "Fergie once banned a journalist from United for having the temerity to reveal Rio Ferdinand had got injured and would miss United's opening game of the season against Everton.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Guess what? Ferdinand missed the game through injury. In other words, the reporter in question had been punished for writing the truth.",
      "But the point is that back then, United revelled in circling the wagons and sticking together. Division wouldn't be tolerated.",
      "It was the club's mantra. It was one the club's greatest strengths and helped them engineer remarkable success. But how times have changed.",
      "So much so that some of those who once entrenched in such an attitude, are now combining or competing with one another to create a poisonous and incessant noise around their former club.",
      "A constant drone of controversial opinion. An almost unbearable Tsunami of voices that is threatening to drown one of the biggest clubs in the world.",

      "I once walked into a lift in a hotel in Rimini to find Roy Keane walking out. We didn't know each other, but his decision to look straight through me while rejecting the chance to respond to a courteous 'hello', felt childish and pathetic.",

      "Memo to Keane - if, as you suggested, Lisa Carrick is now picking the United team, then she's doing a damn fine job mate, considering how well her husband's side did against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "But the nadir is still to come. Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes chose to mock Lisandro Martinez's stature, by claiming Erling Haaland would pick him up and carry him on his back.",
      "As it turned out, Martinez stuck Haaland in his pocket during United's thumping win. Haaland was hauled off with 10 minutes remaining, and sat on the bench with a face like he'd seen a ghost.",
      "Lisandro Martinez had the last laugh after being criticised by ex-United stars(Image: Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "What Butt and Scholes came out with wasn't analysis. It was disrespectful and degrading to a fellow professional. It's tantamount to bullying. And when Martinez had the cheek to offer a response, he was told to 'grow the f*** up'. Classy.",
      "Perhaps we might now have a week off from listening to pundits spout pointless vitriol towards United. If only because their mouths are full of humble pie. The rise of the pundit is startling and relentless in equal measure. There is no escaping the noise.",
      "And where football is concerned, the right to free speech has now become so toxic and nauseous in certain quarters, that we find ourselves living in a world in which a footballer who has won a World Cup (Martinez), is so offended by comments made about him he is inviting some former greats to his house for a fight.",

      "Liverpool and Arsenal might not be in the same parlous state as United right now. But even if these two were, it's doubtful they would have the same problem with some of their former heroes.",
      "Imagine Steven Gerrard mocking Virgil Van Dijk? It would never happen. What a shame Keane & Co don't have the same love for United as they do for listening to their own voices.",

      "However, United haven't opted to add just yet, though there is still more than 10 days for the Reds to change that. Despite their inactivity in the transfer window, Michael Carrick's side continue to be linked with signing several players, with a central midfielder thought to be at the top of their shortlist.",

      "However, Casado has struggled for regular game time at Barca, starting just 10 La Liga matches this season. There is mounting speculation that he could therefore leave in pursuit of more minutes.",
      "It's claimed that Casado had been reluctant to even consider offers to move from Barca, due to the fact his lifelong dream' is to be a first-team star at Camp Nou. But Atletico Madrid have identified Casado as a potential replacement for Conor Gallagher, who moved to Tottenham for £34million last week, while United are keen on a move. The 22-year-old is thought to be contemplating his future at Barca and might be open to an exit.",

There is some United fans that would like to see Rashford return following his spell in Spain - but Murphy doesn't think that proposition is possible.",
      "When quizzed on the current state of proceedings at United, Murphy told BOYLE Sports that Rashford should focus his attention on a new challenge away from United. He said: \"I don't think Michael Carrick, or whoever gets the job, will be able to influence the club to change their approach on Marcus Rashford.",

      "Saturday's Manchester derby was the first time that he had started a Premier League match since May. Mainoo also played 90 minutes for the first time since United's infamous Carabao Cup second round tie with Grimsby Town in late August.",
      "He came straight back into the squad under Darren Fletcher. Mainoo featured for the first time in weeks against Burnley.",
      "The midfielder then started against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round. Remaining in the team when they beat Manchester City meant consecutive starts for Mainoo.",
      "Between those two games under different interim coaches, it is understood Carrick told Mainoo he would be part of his plans for the rest of this season. That information came with an instruction to focus on re-establishing himself for his boyhood club and prove Amorim was wrong to sideline him.",

      "As such, Napoli can forget about any loan move for the midfielder this month. Weeks of Mainoo speaking with the Naples club will now come to nothing after his focus changed under Carrick.",
      "The club's former midfielder spoke highly of Mainoo before taking his new job. Carrick said in an interview with Rio Ferdinand last summer: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to [build the team around them]. United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",

      "Carrick explained: \"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom.",
      "\"I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit, but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and creating and taking the ball. I think he's got a massive future.",
      "\"I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get. He's got it, and he's shown that.",
      "\"It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you, and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez has ended up in a war of words with two former Manchester United greats(Image: )",
      "The Gary Nevilles are at it again. Okay, this time it wasn't actually Neville who incurred the wrath of people at Manchester United, but the podcast personality and once-upon-a-time right-back was used as shorthand in Ruben Amorim's final press conference, and we all know who and what he means.",
      "Podcast culture is the latest battleground between the modern-day United and its greats of the past and no club seems to have it quite as bad. When the Class of '92 came towards the end of their playing days, there was always going to be intrigue at what comes next, but nobody had annoying podcasters on their bingo card.",
      "That is how they are often viewed at United, and the style of a podcast - lighthearted, engaging, different - is causing another pinchpoint. Just witness the war of words between Lisandro Martinez and Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes over the past few days as an example.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "If Martinez thought his forthright response after Saturday's derby day victory would be the end of it, he was mistaken. Butt and Scholes escalated the drama on Monday in the latest edition of The Good, The Bad & The Football.",
      "The former United midfielders tore into Martinez for having the temerity to hit back at what he clearly felt were disrespectful comments about how Erling Haaland would bully him at Old Trafford on Sunday. Part of the issue here is the format. Podcasts are different to TV analysis, and the market is so saturated that you have to stand out.",
      "As Butt said, the comments about Haaland picking Martinez up and running with him clearly weren't serious. It's the kind of thing you can't say on TV or radio, but can on a podcast. It's supposed to be funny. If anything, the biggest problem with those comments was their inaccuracy. Martinez has had several excellent games against Haaland in the past.",
      "Now that the Argentine has responded, Butt is telling him to \"f***ing grow up\". Scholes, it should be said, was much more measured, but there is no doubt the fanbase is firmly in the corner of Martinez here.",
      "Discontent at former players throwing out digs in the media has been rising recently. Podcast sofas, radio booths and pundit chairs are stacked with Old Trafford title-winners and all of them are competing to get that viral clip on social media.",
      "But here's the thing. Supporters would have a great deal more respect for the likes of Butt and Scholes if they turned their attention to the real problem at Old Trafford: an ownership regime that continues to hold the club back. The shoddy mistakes under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the years of waste under the Glazers are a far bigger problem than whether Martinez is tall enough to mark Haaland.",
      "On this subject, they are often quiet. There was a period around the European Super League when criticism grew, and Neville has raised it occasionally since, but for others, it seems to be a topic they are desperate to avoid. Far easier to take shots at the current players.",
      "Scholes said in 2023 that the Glazers had backed every manager they had hired at Old Trafford, which is a very basic view of a club that has been less than the sum of its parts and rarely invested at the right times. Butt spent nine years of his post-playing career at United before leaving, and three years ago, he said he was \"sick of people upstairs telling me about football.\"",
      "There is still an opportunity to go further, however. The ownership structure at Old Trafford remains a mess and further protests are planned at the next home game. The idea of Ratcliffe and the Glazers working together to deliver success feels unlikely.",
      "Ahead of that Fulham fixture, it will be interesting to see whether the club's former players confront the elephant in the room. Martinez vs Butt and Scholes has been great drama and I'm sure their numbers will have gone up this week. But many United fans would like to hear their views on the owners as well as the players.",

      "Dorgu scored another important goal in the Manchester derby.(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "In November, Patrick Dorgu milled about Carrington's second floor to fulfil a sponsorship duty. He was yards away from the press conference room, blissfully unaware that his manager had just knifed him.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" said Amorim. The bruising quote was splashed on back pages and spread like wildfire on social media.",
      "Amorim had explained Manchester United were conceding too many goals because his players were \"really soft.\" That was the standout line of the press conference until an innocuous last question about Dorgu.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Amorim was sacked at the beginning of the month, his ruthless comment about Dorgu was cited by United sources, who admitted that senior club figures had been unhappy with it.",
      "Amorim's forthright nature was brilliant for journalists, who were guaranteed a headline when he spoke, but less so for the people who mattered. The 40-year-old had a sharp tongue and was not afraid to speak his mind, which eventually led to talking himself out of a job after a final bombshell at Elland Road.",
      "Dorgu was still among the players who wished Amorim well after his sacking was confirmed. \"Thank you for everything, Mister. All the best in the future,\" he posted in an Instagram story.",
      "The message spoke volumes about Dorgu's maturity - and there are further examples. Last season, United were awarded a penalty against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, but Dorgu tried to overturn the decision himself with the referee while it was checked by VAR because he hadn't been fouled.",
      "During the recent 2-2 draw against Burnley at Turf Moor, Dorgu just got on with it after being stamped on by Kyle Walker, when performing theatrics would have seen Walker sent off.",
      "Dorgu has character and demonstrated steeliness to shake off Amorim's criticism in November, which might have caused greater harm to a 21-year-old without the same mental fortitude.",
      "Dorgu has responded to Amorim's criticism.(Image: 2026 Simon Stacpoole/Offside)",
      "Instead of sulking, Dorgu has trained to prove Amorim wrong. A source said the Dane \"does loads of extras\" and credited him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crosses, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The Denmark international knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed two goals and two assists in six games, representing his hottest run of form yet since his transfer from Lecce.",
      "Dorgu provided a brilliant assist for Matheus Cunha at Villa Park, and he built on that performance by scoring a superb volley in a gritty 1-0 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Following the Newcastle victory, he spoke to reporters and was asked how he dealt with Amorim's criticism, saying: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player. And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Dorgu added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up. My teammates help me as well.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, along with other members of United's senior leadership group, spoke to Dorgu after Amorim's press conference comment and he received support from the players he is closest to in the United dressing room - Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Dorgu and Hojlund pictured at Carrington in July.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Dorgu should feel more secure at Old Trafford after an encouraging month. There were growing doubts about whether he was cut out for United, but he has shown his mettle by delivering improved performances.",
      "He has looked at home playing on the wing, which started against Newcastle when Amorim played him on the flank. Newcastle's analysts in the press box were audibly confused at the start of the game, trying to work out where Dorgu was playing, and he popped up with the matchwinner.",
      "But Dorgu's recent performances on the wing may even surprise the data boffins who recommended his transfer from Lecce, as he has taken to the role like a duck to water.",
      "(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "It helps that Dorgu briefly played on the wing for Lecce, but performing in the Premier League is a different kettle of fish. He is learning on the job at one of the most scrutinised institutions in the world, and it shouldn't be forgotten that he's only just turned 21.",
      "Dorgu's goal against Manchester City was further evidence of his progress. He was picked to start in a striker-less front free by Michael Carrick, who preferred him to Cunha, and he vindicated that selection.",
      "\"I think Cunha did the hard work,\" Dorgu modestly told MUTV about his goal. “I just believed in my teammate that he would put a good ball in there, and I just closed my eyes and hoped to win.”",
      "Dorgu has gradually found his feet in Manchester, settling in the city without family joining him. Throughout the summer, staff noticed a difference in him, noting his confidence had grown after a challenging first few months at the club, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "Dorgu's confidence should receive another boost after his Manchester derby goal. He does not look very anxious any more.",

      "Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick has implemented a new rule already(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has already introduced a one change at Manchester United after his predecessor Ruben Amorim 'banned' three things before his sacking.",
      "Old Trafford legend Carrick took over from caretaker manager Darren Fletcher last week, stepping in as United’s interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "It came after Amorim was dismissed from his position as head coach 14 months into his tenure, having struggled to effectively implement his tactical philosophy and reportedly clashed with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, over transfers.",
      "In his first match at the helm, Carrick guided the Red Devils to an impressive 2-0 victory over Manchester City, with the team's performance echoing the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson. After just three days of training under their new manager, United seemed transformed, defending valiantly and using wing-play to devastating effect.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This marked shift could be down to a new rule Carrick quickly implemented upon taking charge. As reported by the Daily Mail, the 44-year-old has made training sessions at Carrington shorter but more intense in an effort to improve results this season.",
      "The players' reaction is understood to have been positive and it was 'immediately clear' from the first session that there was a different atmosphere on the training ground. The squad were also introduced to the new coaching team, made up of Steve Holland - who arrived as Carrick's No.2 - along with Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans as first‑team coaches.",
      "There is believed to be an effective combination of expertise and characters among the backroom team and a 'positive dynamic' seems to be developing already. Training sessions have also featured increased focus on one-to-one work with players and the squad are understood to be impressed by the attention to detail being shown.",
      "It remains unclear whether Carrick has scrapped the three bans previously put in place by Amorim during the Portuguese manager's reign or whether he has kept them. One of Amorim's core principles at United involved banning players from treating international breaks as holiday opportunities, with Marcus Rashford and Casemiro notably facing scrutiny for flying across the Atlantic when they had only been granted a few days away from training to rest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's non-negotiables didn't bring success(Image: Nick Potts/PA Wire)",
      "Discussing the situation, Amorim said: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash or Case.",
      "\"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, highlighting his determination to improve his squad's physical conditioning. The Portuguese manager acknowledged early in his tenure that it was \"impossible\" to win the Premier League without a team that works hard.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won’t win,\" he said. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won’t win.\"",
      "Manchester United looked rejuvenated in Carrick's first game in charge(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "His third rule targeted his coaching staff, forbidding them from delivering overly complex instructions to players. The former Sporting CP manager insisted that if he couldn't convey a tactical concept in one sentence, it shouldn't be communicated until simplified.",
      "Reports suggested the approach was initially well-received by the players, given the 'clarity' of his instructions. However, this didn't translate into success on the pitch, as his players found it difficult to adjust to his 3-4-3 system even after a year in charge.",
      "It seems the players have had no such trouble adapting to Carrick's instructions, as shown by their impressive performance in the Manchester derby. They will face an even tougher test with a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, where they will take on league leaders Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly registered an interest in Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado amid the ongoing search to bolster their midfield in the January transfer window.",
      "United decided against signing a midfielder in the summer under Ruben Amorim, instead spending their budget on three attackers and a new goalkeeper. Another figure in Michael Carrick's midfield has been tipped this January, but it's understood that a new signing will only come in at the right price.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's return to the starting line-up against Manchester City means a potential exit away from England is off the table. Manuel Ugarte, who Ajax want, and Casemiro make up Carrick's options in midfield for the remaining 16 games of the season.",

Atletico Madrid are also keen on the midfielder, who was the subject of an offer from West Ham in the summer, after Conor Gallagher's move to Tottenham earlier this month.",

It's understood that United's preference is to sell this summer and cash in for a significant overhaul of the playing squad.",

      "David Beckham has lost touch with eldest son Brooklyn(Image: Justin Goff Photos/Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United and England midfielder David Beckham has been in the headlines after explosive comments from his son Brooklyn on Monday.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed,\" said Brooklyn, 26, on his social media channels.",
      "The response to the comments has been mixed, but David's former United team-mate John O'Kane has been among the loudest football voices on Brooklyn's side. O'Kane previously lived with his one-time colleague and has been vocal about the experience, though David has previously given his own take on what he's like to live with.",
      "\"Let's just say he likes to be in TOTAL CONTROL and was OBSESSIVE on PERFECTION,\" O'Kane, who came through United's academy but left for Everton in 1998, wrote on X. \"If it took Brooklyn to say this and burn down the so-called perfect family. Brand Beckham should not come before your kids no matter what has happened!!”",

      "In 2023, however, David opened up about living with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Speaking on a Netflix documentary about his life, he indicated one way it manifested itself was in cleaning and organising his family home after others had gone to bed.",
      "“The fact that when everyone’s in bed I then go around, clean the candles, turn the lights on to the right setting, make sure everywhere is tidy. I hate coming down in the morning and there’s cups and plates and, you know, bowls,\" he said.",
      "David Beckham at the premiere of his Netflix documentary in 2023(Image: Justin Goff Photos/Getty Images)",
      "“I clip the candle wax, I clean the glass, that’s my pet hate, the smoke around the inside of a candle. I know, it’s weird,\" he admitted.",
      "Beckham has spoken about his condition before, including with ITV in 2006. In the interview, conducted ahead of that year's World Cup, he spoke about attempting to stop acting on his compulsions but being unable to do so.",
      "“I’ve got this obsessive compulsive disorder where I have to have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs,\" he said. \"I’ll put my Pepsi cans in the fridge and if there’s one too many then I’ll put it in another cupboard somewhere … everything has to be perfect.”",
      "Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has hit headlines for comments about his family(Image: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Vogue)",
      "Ahead of the release of the Beckham documentary in 2023, the charity OCD-UK called for greater understanding of how the condition can affect sufferers. It addressed media coverage of Beckham's comments and the failure to address other ways in which OCD can impact those with the condition.",
      "\"For example it (the coverage) doesn’t mention reoccurring intrusive thoughts, fears or worries or a severe impact on life, all of which a formal diagnosis of clinical OCD requires,\" OCD-UK said. \"Such reporting perpetuates the myths of OCD and stigmatises the suffering that people go through.\"",

      "Guardiola shakes hands with Carrick.(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "\"Think forward, play forward, run forward\" has been the message drilled into Manchester United's academy players across decades. It's a mindset that has been the foundation for success at the football club. On Saturday, Michael Carrick went back to basics against Manchester City to help his team produce United's finest Manchester derby performance since the 2024 FA Cup final triumph.",
      "United looked like a proper United team, limiting City to just one shot on target and having three goals disallowed for offside in a dominant 2-0 victory. It was goalless at half-time, but the home players were applauded back into the dressing room. United's fans finally recognised what they were watching.",
      "\"So different, so different,\" Lisandro Martienz told reporters when asked about Carrick's impact in training. United were aggressive, they played on the front foot, their attitude and mentality were different.",
      "Just 54 days before the Manchester derby, United limped to a humiliating 1-0 defeat to a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The difference between the two performances is chalk and cheese.",
      "Martinez's answer about Carrick's impact spoke volumes about what he and his backroom staff achieved in three days, but it also reflected badly on Ruben Amorim. United were unshackled against City, and the performance was total vindication of the decision to axe Amorim and appoint Carrick.",
      "Mbeumo celebrates after scoring in the derby.(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "Amorim secured a few memorable victories during his season-and-a-half in charge at United, with wins against City at the Etihad and against Lyon at Old Trafford the pick of a limited bunch.",
      "However, those results were secured thanks to brilliance from individuals. Amad was responsible for single-handedly turning the derby on its head in December 2024, while Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire miraculously scored late goals against Lyon. United could have easily lost both of those matches.",
      "On this occasion, United were collectively outstanding against City, and it was impossible to argue that it was a fluke. City suffered their biggest expected goals (xG) defeat in their history, which confirmed the visual impression: United were rampant and thoroughly deserved their 2-0 win.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is that Man United were better than Man City. You have to accept it,\" said a disappointed Guardiola during his post-match press conference.",
      "Carrick outfoxed the greatest manager in the Premier League after seven months out of the game. \"We've got season tickets and my family comes, so I've been to a lot of games over recent times and you get to know the players and your own eye,\" said Carrick after the game.",
      "\"Everyone has an opinion and your instincts, and then there was a few days to prepare, so the balance of how much information, what the lads could take on, being fair to them to not overdo it.\"",
      "The debate throughout Amorim's tenure was whether United would improve by playing a different formation. A big part of that was Amorim's system forced Bruno Fernandes to play in a deeper role.",
      "Fernandes was relocated to his strongest position by Carrick and, unsurprisingly, delivered a superb display. \"I've spoken to Bruno, I've known him a long time now, and I thought he was fantastic today,\" said Carrick. \"The way he played the position, he's so clever, and he takes up space.\"",
      "Fernandes is playing in his best position again. (Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Carrick's team selection was perfect. Harry Maguire was recalled and was superb alongside Martinez, while Kobbie Mainoo sparkled on his first start of the Premier League season.",
      "It was a big decision to name Benjamin Sesko on the bench given he'd scored three goals in his last two matches, but a striker-less attack of Patrick Dorgu, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad was the right choice. Carrick was spotted with his arm around Sesko during the post-match celebrations.",
      "The tactics were executed perfectly. United operated with a 4-4-2 shape at times, and they played narrow, giving City's wingers yards of space by the byline. However, when the ball was played to those wingers, Diogo Dalot or Luke Shaw would sprint out - and the forward ahead of them would drop back.",
      "Guardiola's side were unable to play inside from their wingers toward United's box, which is how they score plenty of goals in the Premier League, because of Carrick's tactical instructions.",
      "The defensive organisation made a significant difference. Carrick added Steve Holland to his backroom staff, and the result was also a huge tactical win for the 55-year-old, who oversaw the bulk of the coaching in training during Gareth Southgate's tenure as England manager.",
      "Holland arrived with bags of experience, having previously spent years advising successful managers at Chelsea. Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were key in the victory as well.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece on the touchline. Binnion was sitting behind the press box, passing down information to the bench from the advantage of a bird's eye view.",
      "Carrick hopes United can continue to soar during the remainder of the season.",

      "Senne Lammens: Lost his bearings to needlessly concede a first-half corner but made amends with a save from Max Alleyne. Good hands in the second half. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a reckless early challenge on Jeremy Doku and then a poor pass straight out of play, but did well to recover his poise after that. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Should probably have scored early in the game but excellent defensively against Erling Haaland. A real front-foot performance. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Superb sliding block on Haaland early in the second half. Read the game well and was good on the ball. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Booked in the early stages as well but coped well with Antoine Semenyo, who had Phil Foden in support in the first half. Intelligent performance. 7",
      "Casemiro: Should have scored, but excellent recovery tackle on Haaland after Kobbie Mainoo gave the ball away. A magnificent holding midfield performance. 9",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely shimmy past Semenyo a reminder of his talents. A bit careless with a loose pass to Haaland in the second half but deserves a run in the team. 7",
      "Amad: A real livewire. Tormented Nathan Ake and then got Nico O'Reilly booked inside three minutes. Could have easily had a goal and was a threat throughout. Hit the post late on. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Unlucky with the narrowest of offside calls. A sublime pass to create a chance for Dorgu and perfect pass for the goal. Bruno at his best. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu: A surprise selection but what an impact. Sharp on the ball, good first-half volley and really alert to get the second goal. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Exceptional work rate and clever movement to try and pull City's defenders out of position. Good volley to test Donnarumma and clinical with his next chance. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Made an impact at both ends of the pitch. Big tackle on the edge of his own area and assist for Dorgu's goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Little time to make an impact after coming on for the shattered Casemiro. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Thought he had scored late on but ruled out for offside. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven: A late introduction. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Malacia, J. Fletcher, Sesko",

      "Keane then shared his own opinion, insisted: \"Well maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean? We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

This is, after all, a club that values its principles enough to stick to them even when straying from them would have brought more success, at least in the short term, according to an article I wrote for this site back in 2016. Jesus of Montreal I didn’t realise it was that long ago.",
      "I have some sympathy for Glasner, because the timing of the decision to sell Marc Guehi (and therefore withdraw him from selection for the Sunderland game) was about as bad as it could get. At the same time, it seems hugely unlikely that he would not have been aware of the negotiations taking place, and must have expected this would happen eventually, so there’s no real excuse for being caught out by it.",
      "Glasner’s main mistake, however, is not spinning the story his way. His previous comments have suggested he wants about 20 first team-calibre players but wants to pick the same starting XI when everyone is fit. The first of those is the preserve of the biggest clubs, and while it’s a nice ambition to have, there’s a reason clubs the size of Palace tend to fall into the second group.",
      "While his squad on Saturday was, as Harry Redknapp might say, down to the bare bones, it was almost the perfect opportunity to make his case to the board: “I used the players I had available but they’re not ready for the Premier League yet, we need reserves who are”. Instead, he made no substitutions, even with his team 2-1 down with 20 minutes to play, a move that came across as petulance bordering on unprofessionalism.",
      "This is where I have sympathy for the board: by their standards they did spend significant money (approximately £50m) in the summer on fleshing out the squad, something they likely did knowing they’d receive a big fee for Eberechi Eze. For Glasner’s talk of having his heart broken, Palace did make a good start to the season, even without Eze. If the timeline we’ve been told about is correct, then Glasner informed the board he was going to leave at the end of his contract. Despite knowing this, they still broke their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson, a player described as a perfect fit for Glasner’s system, in January. It’s not reasonable to expect a club to spend a fortune every time their manager has a fit of pique, even if there will always be the lingering suspicion that a couple of judicious signings in the summer might have avoided all of this.",
      "Where the board deserve some credit is in (at least as of 3pm on Monday) not being so fragile of ego as to sack Glasner for his insolence. I don’t expect they’re happy about what their manager has said, but it’s definitely the reaction of a grown-up to treat it for what it is, an outburst rooted in frustration and a situation that can be mediated, if not fully repaired. It’s fair to say that plenty of club directors would not have given Glasner this much leeway and you have to wonder if potential employers are having second thoughts about appointing him.",

      "I see it’s been decided that Thomas Frank doesn’t have what it takes to be Spurs manager. He can’t deliver what Spurs fans want. But Spurs fans won’t say what ‘it’ is. What do you want? To be in the top 6 every year? Champions League every year? Title race? Ok, but ahead of who? There are 7 other teams who want all that and can realistically achieve it – which of those should Spurs be displacing? Which of the midtable sides – Everton, Sunderland, Brentford, Brighton, Palace, etc – are Spurs entitled to be ahead of?",
      "The fact bears repeating: Spurs finished *17th* last year. Obviously their fans immediately spring into action when this is pointed out: ‘oh, we won a European trophy!’ Brilliant, let me know how following in West Ham’s footsteps is working out for you. ‘Oh we were concentrating on Europe, we could have finished higher in the league, we just didn’t want to.’ Yeah ok. Maybe you shouldn’t have sacked the manager who masterminded this false rubbishness in that case? And just told him, g’day, we want to finish higher in the league this year mate. Yeah, 1st would be lovely actually mate. Have a VB.",
      "Some of this year’s games have been awful and hard to watch; some of the results have been terrible. Yes. And? Welcome to being a football fan. Everyone has to deal with this. Superclubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, etc feel they’re entitled to skip this part of the experience. Spurs are not these clubs. Their fans think they are long-suffering. They are not.",
      "Look at the defensive players Frank has got to work with: Paulinha has the brain of a dog; Udogie and Porro are complete disgracia; Spence acts like a child on Supernanny. Spurs fans won’t hear anything said against their centre backs, but they are objectively average: Van der Ven can run fast and Romero kicks people and complains a lot, wow. Maybe stop people from scoring occasionally? And Vicario.",
      "But Frank is getting a better tune out of his back 6/7 than anyone since the last time Spurs finished above Arsenal. They’ve conceded over 60 goals for the last 3 seasons in a row; this year they’re on course to concede 50. And aside from Arsenal, they have the best away record in the league – a sign that when they can keep games tight and put the onus on the opposition, they can be successful. It’s not hard to find signs that Frank is actually improving this team, if anyone has the patience to look. Granted, not relative to the imaginary version of Tottenham that their mad fans have in their heads; but relative to the one in the real world that, apart from the worst set of promoted sides since the competition started, was the *worst team* in the premier league last season. Pretend this wasn’t true if it makes you feel better, knock yourself out.",
      "Obviously, Spurs’ problem in translating this quiet improvement into more points and better home form is, constructing coherent attacks and scoring a lot more goals. But how does a new manager fix this? Richarlison is their best attacking player. *Richarlison*. Unless Ryan Mason CDXXVII can give Maddison new legs and find a 20 goal a year striker down the back of the sofa, where do the goals come from? Tel? Simons? I mean, we’re immediately talking the transfer market aren’t we?",
      "Unless the plan is to hire a new manager and tell them, you can’t sign any new players because actually we already have one of the best 4 squads in the country. If so, I have some bad news. But if it is time to sound the warchest klaxon, then it’s implicit that the current squad is not good enough for what is apparently desired. So why fire a workmen you hired less than a year ago when you’re also admitting the tools you have given him are no good?\nNeil Raines",

      "Having last season watched Rasmus Hojlund do a similarly ineffective job up top, I do get the instinct to defend Gyokeres. Having an inept striker can be an especially grating experience – even if the rest of your team is humming and producing cohesive build-up play, you’re never far from a move breaking down via the link in the team that should add that crucial iota of potency.",
      "It’s made all the worse when they show occasional flashes of quality or produce a smart finish. “See? The ability is there, consistency is what’s missing”, we tell ourselves. But when the required quality is lacking, you can’t expect a sub-standard striker to produce those flashes more regularly. Sometimes, your expensive frontman is only able to impact games sporadically because that’s his ceiling.",
      "Rob’s argument for Gyokeres doing fine doesn’t really touch on his ability though – it seems entirely based around Arsenal sitting pretty in mid-January with him in the team. Arteta picks him for the team top of the league, and he’s an actual football manager, so if you think he’s crap, you are clearly wrong sir. But it doesn’t work that way does it? Anyone who’s watched a middling amount of Arsenal this season will tell you that he’s struggled badly.",
      "Isn’t it possible, or even probable, that Arsenal would be in an even stronger position if they’d invested in a striker who was at a level consistent with the rest of their team? 10-15 points clear with no lingering doubts over their goal threat maybe? Gyokeres really doesn’t pass the eye test – poor goal return, minimal contribution, looks laboured and out of sync when he does get involved. The frequent rush to highlight his effort and attitude has been a giveaway to be honest – it’s a classic case of damning with faint praise. Hojlund often got the same sympathetic treatment when charging after a pass down a channel only for it to bounce off his knee out of play.",
      "You can be top of the league, top of the Champions League etc., but still have some weak links Rob. And it’s hard to term Gyokeres as anything other than that up to this point. You’re rightly happy with a season that’s well on track in spite of his struggles. But if it ends with a trophy (or more than one), it might be fairer to laud the strength of the squad around him than trying to say that he must be good just because Arteta made him part of it.\nKeith Reilly",

Apart from one thing: “Secondly, too much change and too many injuries means the team isn’t playing anywhere near its potential – yes yes every team has these, but how many times has changing the manager miraculously fixed everything? ”",
      "My problem with this is the way he has set up the team; it’s just so f**king boring to watch. My belief is it’s the system not the injuries or the bedding in. I’d honestly relinquish a few places in the table in exchange for some excitement. The infinite horseshoe tactic is the worst thing I’ve seen in all the years I’ve watched them play (mid 80s – god I’m old). A new manager coming in may actually release the shackles and let them play with expression and freedom we so desperately lack at the moment. Point taken though, let’s ride the season out.

Quite unprofessional, but ball boys can sometimes be a bit cheeky… However Spain pulled the same trick in the semi-final and got away with it. Noting that match officials seem utterly non-plussed to these anticss and that Pickford needs to stay focused on the game, Dean Henderson comes over to keep the towel safe personally. Unpeturbed by this the ball boys and staff continue to play capture the flag with this towel and then, Spain’s subs start going tying in on the act.",

      "So you can imagine the feeling among the England camp and fans as the ref appears to be acting, let’s say, rather generous to the Spanish team in chalking off an England goal for the softest of not quite fouls expertly preventing VAR intervention, and then giving the Spanish team a soft penalty at the other end moments later?",
      "Could you at this point really feel too shocked and appalled when, let’s say Southgate calls his players off down the tunnel in disgust, eventuality giving in to Harry Kane’s insistence that we have to be professional? Would you still really not be at the point of cheering when Pickford, bullied all match, decides to put off Ferran Torres before the spot kick?",
      "And when somehow England win the match and lift the trophy against all odds and apparently the will of literally everyone else involved in this sham of a match, and as Southgate brings his daughter out to the presser, to be greeted by heckling Spanish reporters, could you truly blame him for adjusting the medal around his neck then walking off and giving two digits to all involved?",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Manchester United) – £42.4m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",
      "MORE ON PREMIER LEAGUE SPENDING FROM F365\nPremier League net spend table over the last five years\nThe biggest spender in every Premier League season – and how they fared",
      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (22 games) – worth around £18.5m",

      "20th) Burnley (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "",
      "While it will vary due to inflation, fluctuating operating costs and other mitigating factors, it is possible to estimate how much total prize money each Premier League team will be paid in 2025/26 based on the payments made in 2024/25.",
      "1) Arsenal – £71.6m",
      "2) Manchester City – £68.9m",

      "Unai Emery has foolishly been named Premier League Manager of the Month and then conducted a weird interview hinting at issues behind the Aston Villa scenes.",
      "That might not sound like a potent combination for a prompt sacking but in this particular season it is at least an inadvisable path to go down.",
      "Emery has followed an entirely doomed succession line of Premier League Manager of the Month award winners in 2025/26: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot. And the two winners at the end of 2024/25 were Vitor Pereira and Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "In the cases of Maresca, Amorim and the entirely miserable Glasner especially they were crowned against a backdrop of hierarchical and boardroom issues which ultimately helped trigger their departures.",
      "So Emery saying Villa “are not contenders to be in the top five” and venting about “other teams with more potential than us” in a nod to Spurs hijacking their move for Conor Gallagher and Donyell Malen being sold before a replacement was secured, did not sit right with many.",
      "Jamie Redknapp called it “one of the oddest interviews I have ever seen”. Ashley Young thought it was “weird”. Stuart Pearce wondered “whether the frustration going forward will be too much for him that he can’t take this team any further”. Brooklyn Beckham was asked for comment but he’s got a lot going on.",
      "The likelihood of Emery actually leaving this season is infinitesimal; the bloke just wears his heart on his sleeve and was understandably slightly rattled by having to play David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "But in the unlikely event he does leave a post in which he holds an unimaginable amount of power and leeway, Emery would not be the first Premier League Manager of the Month to resign or be sacked in the same season.",
      "He wouldn’t even be the first at Villa Park to be hit by the curse…",

      "The Mourinho boom and bust cycle was in full flow by November 2020 when Spurs beat Brighton, West Brom and Manchester City, rounding the month off with a draw at Chelsea to consolidate their place atop the Premier League a year after his appointment.",
      "That form soon turned and by the time Mourinho was sacked in April, Spurs were barely clinging to a qualification spot for the same Europa League that Dinamo Zagreb dumped them out of despite their coach being in prison at the time.",
      "Spurs tried to hit Mourinho where it hurts, cutting ties six days before the Carabao Cup final and preferring Ryan Mason to lead them out against Manchester City. But they underestimated the Portuguese, who just counts the trophy among his collection anyway.",

      "“Our poor sequence of results stretches back more than three months,” explained West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace, mindful of what came shortly before that.",
      "The newly promoted Baggies felt compelled to act after winning three of 16 Premier League games and slipping into a relegation battle that seemed to be comfortably in the rear-view mirror by September. A home draw with Tottenham, derby spoils in a 3-1 win over Birmingham and a dramatic 3-2 victory at Arsenal, combined with beating Manchester City in the League Cup, had helped dampen the disappointment of a six-goal opening-day thrashing at the hands of Chelsea.",
      "As high as sixth at one stage, West Brom subsequently crashed towards the trap door and only the safety net of Roy Hodgson could rescue them and indeed any of us. But especially and always Crystal Palace.",

      "Few neutral, critics and even fans gave Hull City a tiger’s chance in the ocean of surviving as a Premier League team in their most recent top-flight season. Promotion had been secured through the play-offs but Steve Bruce left less than a month before the campaign began, the first team contained 13 senior players at one point and a protracted takeover looked no closer to being completed.",
      "There seemed to be no hope, although the gallows humour among those who remained was strong.",
      "Against all odds, reigning Premier League champions Leicester were vanquished on the opening day and Swansea fell to Hull too. Manchester United only escaped from the KC Stadium with a win at the end of the month through Marcus Rashford’s stoppage-time strike as Phelan orchestrated an excellent start in his unfamiliar role of being anything other than Manchester United assistant.",
      "But one league win in 18 finally forced Hull into action, perhaps a little too late for Marco Silva to get to know the Premier League. By the time they had lost 6-1 to Bournemouth in October the good Phelan had already long worn off.",

      "September 2001 was particularly flattering as Liverpool, Southampton and Blackburn were swept aside, sandwiching a goalless draw with Sunderland. A Champions League tilt at least looked possible. But from November 3 to New Year’s Day they beat only Ipswich in 11 games and the damage was done when they surrendered a two-goal FA Cup third-round lead over United.",
      "Three days after beating Derby and Charlton in consecutive fixtures, Gregory resigned in quite hilarious circumstances due to fan disgruntlement and issues behind the scenes with chairman Doug Ellis.",

      "In only four of his months as Manchester United manager did Amorim win more than a single Premier League game. And to be fair, the effort it took to muster two victories in December of 2024 and 2025, as well as January 2025, made his only October in charge look generational.",
      "It all seemed to click when Sunderland and Brighton were both sent packing from Old Trafford, sandwiching a ransacking of Anfield in a month which mercifully included no participation in the cups and thus no opportunity for Manchester United to embarrass themselves.",
      "That was probably the peak of the entire experiment. Amorim won just three of his next 11 games, but most pertinently challenged the authority of the great Jason Wilcox, to fall on his sword within a couple of months.",

      "Never a particularly natural fit in north London as a mid-table manager promoted beyond his station, Nuno started with three straight 1-0 wins over Manchester City, Wolves and Watford while navigating a Harry Kane transfer saga to send Spurs top.",

      "“We’ve got stars directing our fate, and we’re praying it’s not too late, ’cause we know we’re falling from grace” would have been a fitting way to say goodbye to the millennium’s first Premier League Manager of the Month.",
      "A draw with Arsenal and victories over Bradford and Tottenham offered a glimmer of survival hope at Hillsborough in January. What a month, huh? But of course, captain, it’s Wednesday – they won one of their next seven before Wilson was sacked and Peter Shreeves came in to steer the ship into the First Division.",
      "Wilson never managed in the Premier League again. It didn’t look particularly promising when David Blunkett led four Sheffield MPs in demanding Wednesday take action in mid-January as “this sort of situation would probably have been addressed back in November at most other Premiership clubs”.",

      "Club: Reading\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2013\nPosition when MOTM: 17th\nSacked: March 2013\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "What was the quickest case of the curse striking came in 2013, when McDermott started February as Premier League Manager of the Month and barely made it to mid-March before being rendered unemployed.",
      "Reading went on two separate runs of seven consecutive league defeats that season but January brought brief and beautiful respite with wins over West Brom and Newcastle, as well as a comeback draw with European champions Chelsea. Three more points against Sunderland on February 2 were the last McDermott would collect in his first stint as manager at the Madejski, with defeats to Stoke, Wigan, Everton and Aston Villa plunging them back into the sort of danger even the Nigel Adkins diet could not salvage.",
      "A similar fate befell Adam Le Fondre. The striker was named Player of the Month for January in a Royal double after scoring five times in four games, yet he had to wait until May for his next goal. Le Fondre still set the benchmark that season.",

      "He probably experienced even tougher times in the intervening period, winning only two of his final nine matches and having to deal with more medical professionals telling him Reece James and Cole Palmer will spontaneously combust if he keeps picking them.",
      "What Maresca clearly didn’t understand is that in English, “manage”, if you split the two words, it’s “man”, “age” – you’re ageing men. Or teenaged South American forwards.",

      "Scholes said in the latest episode of The Good, The Bad & The Football: “It’s very much tongue in cheek, everything we talk about.",
      "“I think the point we were trying to make was that, physically, they [Martinez and Haaland] are a mismatch.",
      "“Look, possibly we could have worded it better, I don’t know. It doesn’t sound brilliant when you watch it back but we’re just having a laugh about it.",
      "“If it was about you then you probably would be upset, but you’ve got to give him credit as he was brilliant on the day.”",
      "Scholes also revealed that Martinez previously made his feelings known on a direct message on Instagram, he added: “We exchanged messages on Instagram quite some time ago.",
      "“He wasn’t happy with something I said in the past. I can’t remember what it was. He just said that he’d lost all respect for me.",
      "“I wouldn’t have said this normally but he’s come out and said stuff so why not? He said he had lost all kinds of respect for me.",

      "“What he did on Saturday was brilliant, yes, but you’ve got to do that over a period of time to show you can win the league.",
      "“They’ve got a big game at Arsenal on Sunday so we’ll see what happens.”",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Butt was less apologetic, he said: “First and foremost, he was brilliant on the day and fair play to him.",

      "“It’s tongue in cheek, it’s quite obvious that Haaland’s not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious, that. It’s figure of speech.",

      "“If you’re going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, and come out and react like that, you shouldn’t be at a big football club because I’m telling you now: he’s going to get that for the rest of his career at Manchester United.”",
      "Butt insists that both he and Scholes just want the Man Utd defender to succeed, he added: “You’re going to get your ups and downs. I got so much crap when I played at Manchester United and Newcastle but then the next week you get your plaudits,’ he continued.",

      "Diogo Dalot drew headlines on Saturday after avoiding a red card for a studs-up challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby. It was more attention than he’s received for anything he’s done at Manchester United for a long time. That’s meant more as a compliment than an insult.",
      "He’s rarely bad enough to draw criticism. He’s normally fine and being fine for Manchester United has been no mean feat in what has incredibly been his seven-and-a-half years at the football club. Only Luke Shaw (11-and-a-half years) has been at Old Trafford longer; Dalot is the 23rd longest-serving Premier League player.",
      "Signed under Jose Mourinho in 2018, he’s seen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ruben Amorim come and go; he’s currently enjoying his second helping of Michael Carrick, who – like his predecessors – will presumably find Dalot to be a consummate professional and a safe pair of boots.",
      "There’s a lot to be said for those consistent 6/10 players, particularly when the performances of the long, long list of Dalot’s United teammates past and present have been so variable. But there is also always the possibility that the grass may be greener, quite a lot greener as an alternative view is that his 232 appearances for the club symbolises the Red Devils’ post-Sir Alex Ferguson inadequacy.",
      "His apologists will claim he doesn’t get the credit he deserves, and that may be fair, but we’re also struggling to imagine too many Premier League managers chasing Dalot over the full-backs they currently have available to them. We doubt, for example, that Andoni Iraola would trade Dalot for Alex Jimenez.",
      "The 20-year-old joined Bournemouth from AC Milan on loan in the summer, but is now just four starts from meeting the 18-game requirement for that loan to be turned into a permanent £16m transfer at the end of the season.",
      "In 52 senior games for Milan and Bournemouth he’s yet to score a goal and has just three assists to his name, but as shown frequently in this clash with Brighton, he’s very adept at getting his team up the pitch with what is his outstanding speed and jinking acceleration with the ball at his feet. And while that final bit – the cross or shot – is currently lacking, his technical quality suggests those goal contributions will come in time.",
      "It was his bursting midfield run and crucial pass which set up Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser to make it 4-4 against Manchester United in December, and him playing on the right wing as he did on that day at Old Trafford, suggests Iraola – who it’s fair to say knows his onions – has no doubts over the right-back’s creativity.",
      "Nor will there be concern over his defensive faculties. Kauro Mitoma barely had sniff on the left for Brighton, though was forced to enjoy Jimenez screaming in his face after one instance of many in which the Bournemouth man got the better of him.",
      "Anyone watching him of late will be of a view that Jimenez is a star that’s yet to make the headlines that Dalot has avoided through his mediocrity.",
      "United managed to persuade both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to join them over rivals in the summer, but in this saga of Red Devils transition, for every Champions League-ready star they are able to sign there will be another – like Antoine Semenyo – who opts to move to a better, more stable football club.",
      "As Ruben Amorim found out when he was denied the Semenyo money to spend on an alternative, United aren’t about to throw cash around willy-nilly as they once did, particularly when – as is the case with Dalot – the need for improvement isn’t all that conspicuous.",
      "But there is room for improvement and the best means for United to make gains would be for them to target unheralded players with high ceilings who may only marginally improve the first team when they arrive, but have the potential to make a huge difference in the not-too-distant future. Alex Jimenez is one of those players."

      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender gave a measured response – which he was asked for – to the pundit’s baseless criticism ahead of the Manchester derby. Excuse us for getting into a playground back and forth dear readers, but how about you f***ing grow up, mate.",
      "Rather than being “picked up and run with like a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler” by Erling Haaland, as Butt suggested would be the case, Martinez was the teacher waiting at the school gates to reprimand the father for his tardiness.",
      "It was a magnificent display from the Red Devils centre-back against the Premier League’s most dangerous striker; one Butt and fellow bullsh*t purveyor Paul Scholes might have predicted had their analysis of the battle involved more than a quick glance at their relative physiques.",
      "Saturday was Martinez’s fourth win in five meetings against Haaland and his second clean sheet. If there’s a criticism that can be aimed at the Argentinian it’s that there’s a rick in him. No-one is saying he’s a perfect centre-back; he makes mistakes too frequently to be hailed as a world class defender.",
      "But it’s very difficult to watch Martinez play a game of football and question his aggression, pace or physicality. Scholes’ suggestion that Haaland would “score, then throw him in the net” was also apropos of nothing. It was nonsense. Fiction for clicks.",
      "“He can say whatever he wants,” Martinez said. “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.”",
      "Scholes accepted that invitation but, perhaps frustrated or embarrassed at being The Other Guy On The Podcast not even worthy of reference by the United star, Butt issued a nuclear and unbefitting response.",
      "“We are a podcast, we are three lads in a pub, we are not on Sky doing commentary. It’s quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious that.",
      "“When someone gets so upset about someone in the media or a podcast to start saying they can do what they want and come to my house and all that, f***ing grow up.",
      "“If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying that about you, you shouldn’t be at a big club. He will get that at the rest of his career at United, there will be ups and downs.",
      "“There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. I think it’s really sad that someone gets so upset.”",
      "We’re reticent to draw attention to it as there’s evidently nothing that Butt – at the start of his punditry career – wants more than for this to be dubbed a ‘war of words’. Martinez “doesn’t care” what Scholes thinks; he’s not about to give a sh*t about the thoughts of the guy alongside him. What is he? The podcast producer?",
      "But we were triggered by the obvious need for the man telling another man to grow up to grow up himself. There isn’t a person on earth who took Butt’s claim that Haaland would pick Martinez and run with him literally. It is indeed “f***ing obvious” and definitely not the reason Martinez was irritated, Nicky.",
      "Martinez, like every human being over the age of six knows how metaphors work. He’s annoyed by a) what the metaphor suggests and b) that suggestion being without foundation.",
      "And what’s this rubbish about “emotional” footballers not being suited to “big clubs”. Wasn’t Roy Keane your captain? Didn’t you watch Eric Cantona kung-fu kick a fan? You can’t just tell someone to grow up and expect to win the argument. He’ll be telling him to stop showing off in front of his friends in a minute.",
      "Butt and Scholes also can’t just brush off whatever they say on the basis of this being a podcast akin to “three lads (we would actively avoid) in a pub”. Well actually, they can, but a licence to say anything at all with no regard to facts, stats or simply what people see with their eyes makes it an entirely meaningless pursuit and one we can only hope that Martinez and the rest of the Manchester United players continue to treat with the disdain it deserves.",
      "Every single Manchester United in the Mailbox has picked Lisandro Martinez in his spat with the Class of 92.",

      "Apprehensively waiting for the game to start on Saturday morning the last thing I expected to see just a few hours later was the Old Trafford faithful waving Haaland off the pitch as he was hooked after doing f*** all in derby. It was a brilliant day.",
      "If you look back on Manchester derby games since Fergie left United have done pretty well when considering the gulf between the two over that time. United have 12 wins to City’s 14 with 5 draws. So beating City isn’t unusual. You would also recognise some of the tactics employed by Carrick in previous wins against City. Low block, low possession, and a counter attacking threat were all on display.",
      "However, many of those previous United wins were either on a knife edge or involved healthy doses of fortune. Not since well before Fergie left have a United side so utterly dominated a derby game. Both in and out of possession United dictated the pace and overwhelmed City with a relentless energy.",
      "Carrick was smart, which is a good sign, because he addressed the obvious thing first. United’s main defensive issue under Amorim was too much space in the midfield. So he made the team narrow, closed the space in between the lines, and put more men in the middle. Simple right.",
      "In particular playing Dorgu as a defensive winger who tucked into midfield really helped. It gave Mainoo the cover he needed to follow Foden/Cherki as they roamed and meant Amad and Bruno could jump out to press with Mbeumo when the opportunity arose.",
      "Going forward it wasn’t a case of playing it long and chasing through balls. United played out from the back and held possession in their own third with relative ease, then a straight pass through the middle, usually by Martinez or a very good Casemiro, triggered quick and aggressive attacks.",
      "There was a moment too when Mainoo received the ball then quickly turned the pressing Semenyo and passed out wide to start an attack. It was lovely and exactly the type of thing he needs to more of. He played well and looks so much more comfortable with midfield support though was outshone by many other excellent performances on the day. If he can do that press beating turn 3-4 times a game then he’ll quickly become the pivotal cog in our midfield.",
      "City though were just bad. The derby probably came at a good time for United given the current form of Pep’s team and apparent defensive line issues. There was period toward the end of the first half where Pep altered the positions slightly and City had us pinned to our box, they were knocking it around it that familiar way when they unpick a low block but the threat never came. They just didn’t shoot. Feels a bit like that period last season when they looked lost, almost like Pep trying to make them more direct has neglected the identity that made them so dominant.",
      "Looking forward on Carrick’s United it would be silly to take too much from this performance. Getting up for big games against rivals hasn’t been United’s problem. The comments from Shearer of ‘this performance level has to be the standard now’ just isn’t realistic and exactly what he said after the Liverpool win earlier this season. Derby games are unique because teams often find a higher than normal level. United do need more energy and urgency in general but expecting that performance every week is foolish.",
      "Tactically too Carrick can’t really do that to other teams. They will have to win whilst dominating possession and by unlocking the kind of low block he deployed on Saturday. United have been fairly proficient in attack this season, Carrick needs to find a way to maintain that threat whilst keeping control and remaining resolute in defence. That isn’t simple.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "…What a performance in the derby, probably our best in years, and I was delighted enough to watch the match back in full and highlights on MoTD. The team looked well organised, dangerous in attack, and the energy and desire to press, defend and close down space was tremendous.",
      "Nobody can question that we have the makings of a good squad and, therefore, there is some talent there; although here comes the b-bomb. But, these players have shown before that they can raise their game in the bigger matches, reflected in our healthy number of points gained against the top half of the table this season. Our issue has been the low-block teams when we have more of the ball – can we break those teams down and, more importantly, show the same hunger and desire to work hard off the ball to defend well as a team? Time will tell, so let’s keep our powder dry for now. (Making up 15 points at this stage is doable, yeah? Beat Arsenal and it’s only 12! Shh, they’ll say you’re crazy).",
      "In other news, I do hope those Liverpool fans calling for Slot’s head (did he not win the league last season or was that actually a bad dream) and hoping Alonso will come in know what they are letting themselves in for. They need to appreciate that his most successful system thus far has been using 3 at the back at Leverkusen, and arguably it was a shift from this system and style to placate the Madridistas that led to his demise there.",
      "Assuming that’s acceptable then brace yourselves, as you’re in for a treat. As soon as results start going south, which they will if even temporarily to restructure the squad, it is all you will hear about from the media, ex-players and impatient fellow fans. Until he is eventually hounded out with his 3-4-3 tail between his legs back to the Basque region and you bring in Stevie G or Ian Rush to save the day.",

Maybe one of the current best managers in Europe knows something. Or maybe Stewie or Will Ford etc. know more about football? Somehow I doubt it. Only 2 strikers have more than 10 goals in the league this season, and nobody was clamouring for Thiago. I would have liked Ekitike though…",
      "Let’s move on and talk about more interesting things like how is Thiago challenging Haaland for the golden boot? Whats happening over in Brentford, they are joint most in form with Arsenal. Everton are now in contention for a Champions League place, what? Fulham have snuck their way in too.

Arsenal dropped two points and we’re allegedly a disaster and complete bottle jobs for doing so . However, it turned out to be a point gained as City and Villa truly bottled their games.",
      "Social media outlets and brainwashed followers of such sites can’t speak or see for themselves about which teams are wobbling all over the shop. It ain’t Arsenal because they drop points on a busy schedule of four away games (two won and one drawn so far) but, as stated Villa and City dropped points. Arsenal are gradually and reservedly pulling away but nobody wants to admit it.",

      "Emery didn’t rant at the owners as they have been magnificent and would spend if the could but their hands are tied.",
      "Looking at Emery last night was grim. We just lost to a team who we typically bank on a win, who were depleted with injuries, who came to Villa Park where we had won 11 in a row and where victory would have seen us 4 points off the top. And lost. And then to make matters worse another good player sold who we really could have done with last night goes and scores on his debut for Roma.",
      "That was the first of 5 games in 14 days with a seriously depleted squad. The options off the bench outside defenders, goalkeepers and kids – Guessand (Henry he is not). Never mind title challenge, just watch the chasing pack gobble up ground on points for those champions league places.",

      "The killer for me is that as I say regularly to my non Villa supporting sons, the club motto should always be “Villa will always let you down”. Here is a brief summary of the hurt over the years since we last won a cup in 1997 – almost thirty years ago by what is deemed a massive club.",

      "He has done a brilliant job at Palace winning the FA Cup, creating a fascinating mix of defensive steel and genuinely attractive attacking play. I’ve no doubt he is lined up with a more high-profile role elsewhere. However, his actions this season have been incredibly selfish. I think much of it stems from the shambles Palace got themselves into over Europe – if I was Glasner I’d be furious with the club.",
      "However, to supposedly throw a temper tantrum to ensure Guehi couldn’t be sold by linking it directly to your own willingness to remain at the club before seemingly just a few months later telling the club you aren’t signing a new contract anyway is pretty embarrassing.",

      "Glasner is a smart man. He would know this. His subsequent complaints over the weekend about having Guehi sold from under him just before a game and how it isn’t normal for a club to sell players like Eze, Olise and Guehi in a relatively short space of time is just self-serving nonsense.",
      "Liverpool",
      "I speak as a Liverpool fan when I say this but my God our fans are annoying (as all fanbases are at different times in different ways). The reaction to dropping points at home to Burnley is presumably a combination of a very disappointing season, an unwelcome record at home to promoted sides, a league where no-one looks great at the minute giving a sense of missed opportunities and many other things including the new availability of a certain Champions League winning former player.",
      "But it genuinely feels to me that a lot of fans were just waiting and hoping that things were going to go wrong for Slot because they still pine for Klopp. That they’ve never taken to him let alone fallen in love with him (as Liverpool fans tend to do with especially major title winning managers).",
      "Often this sort of reaction is blamed on ‘Out of Towners’ or ‘Online Fans’ but it seems that the weekend’s reaction was most prevalent amongst match going fans.",
      "I think Klopp is a God of a man and a manager and I loved Xabi as a player but I would’ve thought the excellent job that Slot had done in his first season would’ve bought him both more respect and time in what is arguably the transition year that we skipped last year while winning the title.\nLindsay, Dublin",

      "Must be hard being a Palace fan right now, but not that hard. Holders of 2 trophies and still in Europe with some amazing players at the club.",
      "None of the 7 one-time FA Cup winners who came before Palace are currently in the PL (Ipswich, Southampton, Wigan, Wimbledon, Leicester, Coventry and Portsmouth). All but Leicester have played in the 3rd tier after winning the FA Cup. You have to go back to Leeds in 1972 to find the second most recent one-time FA cup winner currently in the EPL.",
      "Palace have mastered the goldilocks space in the EPL: not super good, not super bad. It’s led to 13 consecutive years in the prem. For a one-time FA Cup winner like Palace the aim is stability and sustainability not becoming a football super power. With little chance of relegation and a genuine chance of a run in Europe with the possibility of a 4th trophy in one calendar year for Ismaila Sarr, it’s all good.\nBen Teacher"

      "READ: Man Utd DNA ‘proved’ as club stand with ‘one foot in the past’",
      "With the win against Man City, the Red Devils took the rare step of actually taking a chance to (briefly) move into the top four, as their severe lack of consistency has undermined their season.",
      "And now that Carrick’s side has set a new standard to replicate in their remaining games, it is on the players to do something that they have consistently failed to do in the days since Ferguson’s retirement; ensure a performance, a la against Man City, is not a false dawn.",
      "We have been here before on countless occasions with Man Utd, who have become renowned for showing fleeting signs of promise before reverting to their shambolic type once again.",
      "This is why Gary Neville, who has refused “to get giddy or carried away”, or Roy Keane, who has told a fellow pundit to “calm down” regarding Carrick’s start, are likely to be proven right to be pessimistic regarding Man Utd, who have constantly let people down since being dethroned.",
      "Man Utd’s squad showed against Man City that they are capable of producing the necessary performances to fend off Liverpool and Chelsea for the Champions League, but this is reliant on Carrick getting more out of the playing staff than most managers since Ferguson, and history tells us that they will underdeliver more often than not.",
      "This is why INEOS and Carrick are naive to have the ‘ambitious aim’ of qualifying for the Champions League without making a signing to improve their fragile midfield this month, with ‘United’s hierarchy confident he can deliver on their ambitions despite limitations in the transfer market’, according to our pals at TEAMtalk.",
      "The report explains: ‘Sources have told us that although Amorim had informed United’s decision-makers that a new midfielder would be crucial to boosting their chances of European qualification, Carrick believes the squad is capable of achieving that goal without further reinforcements.",
      "‘United will remain open-minded about market opportunities that could strengthen the squad – particularly if a midfielder with Premier League experience becomes available. But with Carrick of the belief that United can achieve their aims without a new midfield addition, United may indeed decide against bringing anyone in.’",
      "Man Utd have now made a final decision to keep Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford after getting “instant trust” from Michael Carrick, says Fabrizio Romano.",

      "This really isn’t about DNA or a ‘throwback’; it’s just a very good performance.",
      "",
      "Manchester United beat Manchester City on Saturday. You might have heard. It was rather impressive. You can read 16 Conclusions here; we wrote hundreds upon hundreds of words on the game and yet somehow managed NOT to use the letters D, N and A. Because it’s a right load of old bollocks.",
      "Michael Carrick proves Manchester United DNA isn’t a myth",
      "We mean this in the nicest possibly way but…does it f***.",
      "Carrick did an excellent job of preparing this Manchester United team to play Manchester City, but let’s not pretend that one game – in which City had a makeshift defence – ‘proved’ anything at all. Otherwise, we would have to pretend that Manchester United beating Liverpool at Anfield in October was ‘proof’ that Ruben Amorim’s system was actually hunky-dory, thank you. And, well, f*** DNA.",
      "We also seem to be collectively pretending that the returns of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are not absolutely key to United’s improvement; it’s a lot easier to play ‘the Manchester United way’ when you have all your best attacking players on the pitch.",
      "“United’s DNA” has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director’s box smiling all afternoon long – why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? That’s not a thing. He played attacking football when it suited; but that wasn’t always sensible away in Europe, for example. You’re not that successful over 20-odd years by having one good (let’s use wingers!) idea.",
      "Manchester United were excellent in dismantling City on Saturday but that’s not about DNA but about Carrick rather sensibly picking a formation and personnel that suited his players. It does him a disservice if we pin all this on some nebulous concept that belongs in the bin.",
      "Can the media please leave that sh*t to Neville and Wayne Rooney.",
      "Of course Rooney is quoted in the Daily Mail, who promise us a journey ‘Inside Michael Carrick’s derby masterclass’ (which includes the masterstroke of arriving at Old Trafford 15 minutes later than usual. Genius).",
      "Essentially Carrick has taken United back to the basics that were so important when he was a player under Ferguson.",
      "He knew that United had to stop City playing by working together to deny them space, close them down quickly in possession and then counter-attack to maximum effect.",
      "You might be forgiven for thinking that’s a description of how any team should play when facing one that dominates possession but no, that’s Ferguson-ball, it seems.",
      "No, we have to pretend that Manchester United were ever going to try and dominate the ball against Manchester City, because that’s what his Middlesbrough team used to do. And we have to pretend that it’s ‘unexpected’ that they didn’t.",
      "While the Middlesbrough team Carrick forged were looking to dominate possession, United were happy for City to have the ball, safe in the knowledge they would be able to defend when the Blues picked their moment. The Reds had just 32 per cent possession – unheard of for a Carrick team.",
      "But not ‘unheard’ of for a Manchester United team playing City. Especially in this new/old era of Sir Alex Ferguson-ball.",
      "It was exactly what United needed to do. Bernardo Silva said it himself after the match, the Reds ‘took the game to where they are good,’ and doing that proved successful. But that does not mean it was expected.",
      "Oh but it was.",
      "",
      "‘More games like this and why shouldn’t Michael Carrick get the job?’ is the headline on Martin Samuel’s column in The Times.",
      "We don’t think Carrick will get to play an injury-ravaged Manchester City defence again this season, nor play against a team who seek to dominate possession quite so religiously, but we agree that a whole raft of wins should probably earn him the job.",
      "But this is bollocks…",
      "So this was a throwback, an instant change for the better. An upgrade on the Ruben Amorim era, a reminder of a time when United stood for something more than institutional discord or commercial enterprise. United took the game to Manchester City as equals, not inferiors. They didn’t try to pass them off the pitch because there will be only one winner of that contest; but they were aggressive, ambitious, vigorous, they ran and ran.",
      "It feels like the bare minimum, really. As we said in Winners and Losers, ‘it is better to properly appraise Michael Carrick against the five teams placed 10th and below who Manchester United face next month, rather than his opening salvo of a home Manchester derby followed by Arsenal at the Emirates’.",
      "But no, that will not do for Samuel…",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, who the cameras always seek out at moments of great elation or despair – and recently it’s often despair – would have recognised this Manchester United. He wouldn’t have known many of the others he has watched since retiring, but Carrick’s red men played with a foot in the past. They created the best chances, they did the most work.",
      "They played ‘with a foot in the past’?! While the reporting around Manchester United remains like this, they are f***ed.",

      "Carrick profiled the players properly and Manchester United benefited from it. The football only left Casemiro when he was asked to patrol the entire middle of the pitch alone, Kobbie Mainoo is disciplined enough to play in a midfield two and Bruno Fernandes might be better deployed higher up the pitch than in a deep-lying pivot.",

Manchester United being the only team in the top five to win on a weekend can’t have happened all that often since the Podcasters of ’92 have been around.",

      "“Callum is a very experienced man,” Nuno said last week. “He’s been in the game for so much time and he knows that his position has changed. So we were honest to each other. Yes, your position has changed but he’s still a player from the club and we still maybe need him.”",
      "That “maybe” was doing an awful lot of heavy lifting even before the Spurs win. Their second top scorer this season might not have joined from Gil Vicente or Lazio as Nuno’s man but only a fool would ignore the part he clearly still had to play in West Ham’s campaign. He is not six goals away from joining the Premier League 100 Club by accident.",
      "It might be that the 33-year-old is granted his wish for more regular playing time with the termination of his contract this month – West Ham would be stupid to sanction that but they are West Ham – yet Wilson can hold his head high in any event at having given his all.",

      "“It’s in the DNA at Everton; we can dig wins out,” said David Moyes of a club that has ransacked the City Ground, Old Trafford with 10 men for 80 minutes, and now the fortress of home dominance that was Villa Park this season.",
      "And who better to explain Everton’s “perfect plan” than the man who struck the post within 11 seconds? As Merlin Rohl said, the midfield “did a great job of keeping close to the players who want the ball all the time”. It helped the Toffees “frustrate” the home crowd and they benefited from not being “the team that needs to push and needs to play forward”.",
      "Since Moyes was appointed last January, no team has won more Premier League away games than Everton, and only Arsenal (37) have accrued more points (34). Those 10 Toffees wins on the road have come in 20 matches; Everton’s previous 10 away victories were stretched over 66 games all the way back to August 2021 and the days of Rafa Benitez.",

The harsher and certainly more preeminent judgement across the more vocal element of a fanbase predisposed to disappointment and retroactive finger-pointing was that a relegation-adjacent manager had not been supplied with the requisite firepower to keep the Championship in the rear view.",
      "Leeds did at one stage in the summer seem to have improved through recruitment in every position before realising late on they had slightly forgotten the attack.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha cost nothing in transfer fees between them, but plenty in wages and the presumed overtime the Leeds medical department was expected to work to keep them fit.",

      "Leeds are the only club with two new signings on five Premier League goals or more so far this season, and both were free agents. The risk has reaped fine reward.",
      "",

      "But beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the City Ground became besotted with those players again after 90 minutes characterised by the same grit, determination and organisation which carried them into the Europa League.",

But Humphreys will almost certainly be sent back for a fee thoroughly eclipsing the sort the Clarets received for James Trafford a few months ago, which remains a club record.",
      "Chelsea being Chelsea, they might chuck £80m in the general direction of Turf Moor next week.",
      "It may be that Burnley and Scott Parker are still slightly too limited to suggest that if Humphreys had been available all season the complexion of their campaign would have been far brighter. But he probably would have at least shattered the unknown record for most goalline clearances ever by the end of September.",

      "A four-match unbeaten streak has injected life and belief into a club that was hurtling towards not just relegation but implosion. Edwards has also coached as many clean sheets as Ruben Amorim this campaign in nine fewer games.",

      "In English, “jammy”, if you split the two words it’s “jam” and “my”: I’ll jam my fingers into my eyes if Rosenior lasts the year with Chelsea playing like that and being out-shot 15 to six at home to Brentford.",
      "The game might still be going if Rosenior was permitted to stop it each time he saw something he didn’t like, even just from Alejandro Garnacho. But a win and a clean sheet in his first game was a bar as low as it was necessary to clear.",

      "His side was soundly beaten and he knew it, with injuries only providing a slight caveat for a deeply concerning performance at either end.",
      "And Guardiola likely realised he was outcoached too. Perhaps he has also discerned his greatest weakness in the process, the one true, enduring Kryptonite to arguably the sport’s finest ever manager: the caretaker.",
      "In the Premier League alone Guardiola has now been beaten by Carrick while drawing with Calum McFarlane (Chelsea), Simon Rusk (Southampton) and Steve Agnew (Middlesbrough). Future quiz question compilers are welcome.",

      "Oh lord.",
      "Even before that it was Vitor Pereira in April and Nuno Espirito Santo in March. The curse is real, and the emphasis Emery put on describing Villa as “not contenders to be in the top five” suggested he knows as much.",
      "Losing out to Spurs in a transfer battle and feeling compelled to sell one of your better forward options – then him scoring on his debut for his new club – without a replacement would, to be fair, send most heads careering towards space.",

      "In isolation, toiling to a point against Liverpool and being held on a trip to Dycheland is fine enough across the course of a league season. In consecutive games, it does start to vaguely resemble a stutter which Arsenal cannot afford to let develop into an actual problem.",
      "An upcoming fixture list of Manchester United, Leeds, Sunderland, Brentford, Spurs, Chelsea and Brighton, with Champions League games and a Carabao Cup semi-final second leg littered in between, means Arsenal must discover their attacking edge again soon.

      "That is: Newcastle would dominate the ball while creating precious little of note as the unimaginative visitors who only ever change the personnel in a flawed system, rather than the system itself.",
      "It is damning that they can be so easily read by a team which, until recently, was being discussed as one of the Premier League’s worst ever.",
      "As a flourish, Wolves might well have predicted the triple substitution around the hour mark – the only time Eddie Howe called on his bench – the wait the 86th minute for Newcastle’s only two shots on target, or Nick Woltemade’s mere 13 touches.",

      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",
      "Here are the options and what Carragher had to say...",
      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",

I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",

      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Paul Scholes and former Man Utd team-mate Nicky Butt mocked Lisandro Martinez's size compared to Man City's Erling Haaland ahead of the derby but the United defender called for criticism to be delivered face-to-face after keeping the City striker out in 2-0 win at Old Trafford",
      "Sunday 18 January 2026 14:38, UK",
      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Martinez said things at United were \"so different\" in the build-up to the win against City, with Michael Carrick taking charge of the team until the end of the season, following Darren Fletcher's brief interim spell in the hotseat after Ruben Amorim's exit.",
      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United.",
      "\"And I can really understand because sometimes it's like 'what are we doing here?' And today, that is the standard for this club.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "\"Let's judge it over the next few months. The key for him is trying to get momentum in the team. He is an English coach, the English media will be pushing for him. He has done well today, but let's see how he does.",
      "\"They've won one game! The last manager won one game. He's only been there three days.",
      "\"Darren Fletcher changed the formation, but there were players missing. Michael Carrick has come in to the dream scenario. Everyone is available, City at home, they've been a little bit off it, he could have had a man sent off.",
      "\"Timing and a bit of luck, they have made the most of it. Take nothing away from him - but everyone just calm down.\"",

      "Nicky Butt on Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez's reaction to criticism ahead of the Manchester derby: \"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house'... grow up\"",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 01:14, UK",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have continued their war of words with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez, with Butt telling the Argentine to \"grow up\" over his response to criticism.",
      "After playing his part in United's 2-0 win over City at Old Trafford, Martinez challenged Scholes to speak to him face-to-face after he and Nicky Butt had mocked the defender's size before his battle with Erling Haaland, suggesting the Norwegian would \"pick him up and run with him\".",
      "Scholes said he had previously exchanged messages with Martinez on social media and given the player his phone number but had \"not heard anything\".",
      "But responding directly to Martinez's comments on the latest edition of his The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Scholes' joint-host and former team-mate Butt said: \"It's tongue-in-cheek, it's obvious Haaland isn't actually going to pick him up and run with him, it's a figure of speech,\" he said.",
      "\"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house', f****** grow up.",
      "\"Literally, if you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a big football club because you'll get that for the rest of your career at Man United.",
      "\"I got so much crap when I played at United and Newcastle, but the next week you get plaudits and clapped at. There's no personal issue with us and Martinez, none.\"",
      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in dire need of a rest. Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",

      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",

      "Asked whether he felt the club is now soulless within their current slump, Carrick said: \"I certainly don't think it's soulless. I think there's a magic around this place. I feel it and I feel at home straight away, coming into the building.",
      "\"Results and sometimes from the outside things look a little bit different, but it certainly doesn't feel majorly different on the inside.",
      "\"Part of my role and the responsibility is shaping what we want to look like going forward as a group. What happens on the pitch and the tactical side and the performances is one thing, but certainly the culture as well and how we think, how we act, how we behave, what it means to us to be here - that's something that is part of my responsibility to spread in the right way.\"",
      "Carrick adds that player mood has been positive and that the training ground has been in a good place.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything. The players have been really good.",
      "\"[The players are] willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put on better performances. That's the feeling I've got.",
      "\"The support staff and everyone is desperate to do well and we need to channel that.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day-to-day. It's not something I sit here and talk about - a few words here and there and it makes it sound good.",
      "\"It's how you behave and what you end up doing day-to-day. That's something we've got to build but certainly at the moment, I feel it's a good place and the training ground's been a really good place.",
      "\"We need to make Old Trafford an even better place with the help of the supporters as well. That's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",
