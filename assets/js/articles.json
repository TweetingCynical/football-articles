      "Manchester United kick off their Premier League campaign THIS WEEK - and their squad has been transformed under Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils can boast a totally new front line following a lucrative summer transfer window.",
      "Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo put pen to paper on moves from Wolves and Brentford earlier this year. The pair have been followed by striker Benjamin Sesko, who completed a big-money switch from German side RB Leipzig.",
      "The Red Devils might not be totally finished there either. A new midfielder is potentially on their shortlist before next month’s deadline amid links with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Away from incomings, United also need to focus on sales. Marcus Rashford has already departed and could be followed out of the door by Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and more.",
      "With that being said, take a look at all of the latest transfer news and rumours from Old Trafford…",
      "Man United have been told to get a move on in their bid to sign Brighton’s Baleba - or risk Real Madrid hijacking a switch. Speaking to talkSPORT, Troy Deeney said: “I think United have to get Baleba this window, or they don’t get him.",
      "“If he has another good season, I do think other teams with Real Madrid and the like will come in and go ‘Bosh, we’ll have him’.",
      "“I think if Man United want him…if I’m Ruben Amorim I’m kind of bullish on that. I’d be saying ‘get this deal done because then I can get you into Europe’. If they can sign him, he can move them up 10 spaces [in the Premier League].”",
      "Barcelona chief Joan Laporta has admitted that Marcus Rashford might NOT be registered in time for the new season following his loan switch to Catalonia. “We’re working to make it happen,\" he said.",
      "“With Marc’s decision, we have the option of registering Joan Garcia, and we’re working on the rest. This week we’ll have news, hopefully good news, to see if we can register them before La Liga starts. And if we can’t, we have time.”",
      "Barcelona have until the end of August to sort the issue out - albeit Rashford could miss the start of the new La Liga campaign.",
      "Sticking with Barcelona, reported United target Fermin Lopez has said he has no intention of leaving the club any time soon. He said: \"I want to stay here. It’s my dream and I will stay, I’m happy to help the team. Many things have been said.",
      "\"But I am going to continue defending these colours and working as hard as anyone else, so that the Catalans are calm.”",
      "Recent reports have claimed that United were considering a £61m offer for the midfielder.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United believe that personal terms with Carlos Baleba will not be an issue with the player keen on the move - but it remains to be seen whether Brighton are open to selling.",
      "Last week those at Old Trafford made contact via intermediaries to gauge whether they could strike a deal for the Cameroon midfielder, who produced an impressive season at the Seagulls and is now attracting a number of admiring glances.",
      "Baleba is likely to cost around £100million - which is just shy of the figure Brighton demanded before they agreed to sell Moises Caicedo to Chelsea two summers ago.",
      "United do not currently have those kinds of sums and from the minute they expressed their interest there was an acceptance that securing the deal would be a huge challenge. They've spent more than £200m to sign the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reports that those in Manchester will still attempt to pursue a deal but know that they may miss out. After landing Sesko's signing on Saturday Ruben Amorim's priority now is on adding a midfielder.",
      "Brighton have already sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea, banking up to £60m, and will be loathed to lose another of their major players whilst there is less need for them to cash in. Their chief executive Paul Barber has played down speculation that the Red Devils have even been in contact and underlined the fact that the Seagulls have no interest in selling more of their top players.",
      "He said: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has told Manchester United he only wants to join Chelsea with the Argentine agreeing to terms over a deal at Stamford Bridge until 2032.",
      "The winger has fallen out of favour at Old Trafford and has been tipped to leave all summer. The Blues' interest dates back to January when they considered a move and Garnacho has no intention of taking up any other offer.",
      "He sees west London as the best place to reignite his career having previously been seen as a future star on the red side of Manchester. GiveMeSport reports that a reunion with Erik ten Hag at Bayer Leverkusen and a lucrative switch to Saudi Arabia were also options put to him.",
      "Napoli even reignited their interest but Garnacho has no plans to join anyone but Chelsea. The 21-year-old is so determined to secure a move to the Blues that he will shun every other avenue and spend a year on the sidelines in Manchester if that's what it takes.",
      "Chelsea hope to seal a deal for around £30million, but that is about £20m shy of what United were hoping to recoup for their player. The Blues had put forward several swap proposals, including Nicolas Jackson, but there is no interest.",
      "Christopher Nkunku is another player who Chelsea have offered to the Red Devils. Axel Disasi and Renato Veiga were also put on the table but United have made it clear that they want cash to re-invest into their squad - not players.",
      "Last term Garnacho scored 11 times - the best total of his career - but had to deal with a midseason positional switch which saw Ruben Amorim try and utilise him as a wing-back. Come the end of the season and the Argentine found himself on the bench for the Europa League final - reacting angrily on social media.",

      "Back in Bilbao's San Mames stadium, Tottenham ended their 17-year trophy drought with a 1-0 victory, courtesy of a fortuitous Brennan Johnson goal. Bale, who won the PFA Player of the Year twice while at Spurs, was on punditry duty and couldn't resist a dig at United's expense.",
      "Commenting on Tottenham's social media post poking fun at the term 'Spursy' - often used to describe their historical tendency to falter in big games - Bale flipped the script. \"It could be a Unitedy thing now, I'm telling you!\" he quipped with a grin, suggesting the Red Devils had inherited the unwanted label of underperforming in crucial moments.",
      "The remark left Ferdinand, a United icon, squirming. \"Can we get off air now?\" he reportedly muttered, clearly unimpressed by Bale's jab.",
      "The broadcaster officially announced Bale's appointment on Monday, along with four other newcomers: ex-West Ham star Michail Antonio, former Lionesses Fara Williams and Anita Asante, and ex-Scotland women's ace Jen Beattie.",
      "Bale sticks out as the cream of the crop, with the five-time Champions League-winning Welshman able to bring his global football pedigree to the studio. His illustrious career - which included a legendary eight-year spell at Real Madrid, two stints at Tottenham and a pivotal role in leading Wales to the 2016 Euros semi-finals - gives him unmatched credibility.",
      "Unlike Ferdinand, whose analysis often leaned on his defensive expertise and United-centric perspective, Bale offers a broader lens, shaped by his experiences across top clubs and different countries. His playful jab at United showed he's unafraid to stir the pot, a trait that could make him a fan favourite in the studio.",
      "Tottenham's victory and Bale's subsequent commentary also highlighted his enduring connection to the club. He praised then-manager Ange Postecoglou's tactics, crediting the Australian for delivering a trophy despite a shaky Premier League campaign.",
      "Ferdinand has been one of their most recognisable faces on TNT during Premier League, Champions League and Europa League matches and has been an ever-present since joining in 2015 under the channel's previous name BT Sport.",
      "The 46-year-old said he wanted to experience a new chapter and focus on his own YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand Presents, as well as his other business interests.",
      "Bale, meanwhile, will join a host of famous names still with the broadcaster, including his former Spurs team-mate Peter Crouch, Chelsea icon Joe Cole, Liverpool greats Michael Owen and Steve McManaman and Scottish legend Ally McCoist.",

      "Harry Maguire has lifted the lid on the excitement surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning Manchester United return, admitting his disappointment in how things ultimately ended.",
      "Ronaldo made a name for himself at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2003 and 2009, before securing a then-world record transfer of £80million to Real Madrid.",
      "The forward continued to excel with Los Blancos, scooping two La Liga titles, four domestic trophies, four Champions Leagues and four of his five total Ballon d'Ors before moving on to Juventus in 2018.",
      "United fans were delighted to hear that Ronaldo was returning to Old Trafford three years later, but his last dance with the Red Devils didn't quite go as planned. While the now 40-year-old managed 18 Premier League goals under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick in 2021/22 as United finished sixth in the table, he reportedly grew dissatisfied with United's team performances.",
      "After falling out of favour under new head coach Erik ten Hag, Ronaldo revealed all in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan, which led to Manchester United mutually terminating his contract in November 2022.",
      "Maguire admits that Ronaldo's return was a breath of fresh air in the dressing room for his team-mates, despite the ending leaving a bitter taste in the mouth.",
      "Speaking with Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the centre-half who has been with United since 2019, said: \"I can't speak a bad word about him. It was amazing to have him, when he walked through the door it was just incredible.",
      "\"It was just so disappointing how it ended and how we couldn't find a way to perform with him in the team. He was performing, he was scoring goals, it was crazy. I don't know how many he scored that year. We were rubbish and he was still scoring goals, so it just shows how good he is.",
      "\"But we just couldn't find a way to... all our system under Ole was about being on the front foot, being aggressive. Pressing, it was like a pressing machine. We weren't the best team, we actually finished third and then second. We probably didn't have the best players.",
      "\"We had some great players, don't get me wrong, but it was all about pressing and working to a tactic and working to a shape, and when to jump and when to stay. And obviously Cristiano came in and we just didn't adapt well enough for him, and you could just tell he was so upset and frustrated.\"",
      "With regards to how he dealt with the process of losing Ronaldo as a senior player, he added: \"We just couldn't believe what happened because we obviously finished third, then second, and then that season we brought in Sanch [Jadon Sancho], Rafa [Raphael Varane] and Cristiano in the summer.",
      "\"And you're thinking, 'Here we go now, like, let's go win the Premier League,' and it just never happened. It just never clicked. And obviously we lost Ole, which was disappointing if I'm being honest. I feel like Ole did an unbelievable job, I'll probably speak more about Ole when I'm retired.",
      "\"But the way that he set us up in the first two years is probably the best I've felt in a team, under Ole and Kieran [McKenna] and Carras [Michael Carrick]. Those three, they had us so well organised. And like I said, we didn't have the best team about. We were just well-coached, tactically brilliant.",
      "\"We could play, we could press. The third season I was there it just didn't work, and it had nothing to do with Cristiano because like I said, he was our best player that year by far. The boys and the tactics around him, it just didn't work.\"",
      "Manchester United are currently gearing up for their return to the Premier League under new boss, Ruben Amorim, who took the reins following the sacking of Ten Hag in October. The Portuguese tactician endured a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the standings last term, but will hope to perform to the best of his abilities with a full summer transfer window and pre-season under the belt.",
      "Amorim has been incredibly active in the current window, recruiting the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to the ranks. Fans will see if a revamped squad will pay off come Sunday, August 17, when United face Arsenal under the bright lights of the Theatre of Dreams.",

      "Along with a picture of a huge ring on her wedding finger, Rodriguez has said: \"Yes I do. In this and in all my lives.\"",
      "Argentinian born Rodriguez has previously posted images of a ring, but neither had officially confirmed a proposal. Ronaldo, who has recently celebrated his 40th birthday had previously admitted that he hadn't asked for her hand in marriage because the timing isn't 'quite right'.",
      "He said: \"I always tell her: 'When we get that click. Like everything with our life, and she knows what I'm talking about. It could be in a year or it could be in six months or it could be in a month. I'm 1000% sure that it'll happen.\"",
      "On her Netflix reality show 'I Am Georgina', the 31-year-old said her friends are always asking about the happy couple's plans. She revealed: \"They're always joking about the wedding. 'When is the wedding?",
      "\"Since Jennifer Lopez's song The Ring Or When came out, they started singing it to me. And well, this is not up to me.\"",
      "Despite not officially confirming their marriage, Ronaldo has often referred to Georgina as his 'wife'. In December, at the 2024 Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, he said: \"It’s a big pleasure to win this trophy. My oldest son is here, my wife [Georgina] is here.\"",
      "Earlier this year, when celebrating her birthday, Ronaldo posted on social media: : \"For the mother, partner, friend, my wife... happy birthday, love. Your light illuminates us and your love infects us.\"",
      "The couple met at a Gucci store in 2016, with the ex-Manchester United superstar admitting that it was a case of love at first sight. \"She's a fantastic person. Yes, it is [true love]. Yes, it was [like magic meeting for the first time]. Gio is part of me. She helps me so much.,\" he told  Piers Morgan in an interview in 2019.",
      "\"Of course, I'm in love with her. She's the mum of my kids. I'm so passionate for her. She's my friend, we have conversations. I open my heart to her. She opened her heart to me. [She's the greatest love of my life]... Why not [get married]. Not now! Not in this interview. Why not, one day... We'll one day, for sure. It's my mum's dream.\"",
      "Since linking up, Ronaldo has moved from Real Madrid to Juventus, before his sensational return to the Premier League with Manchester United. But his incredible reunion ended on a sour note after falling out with manager Erik ten Hag leading to his contract being terminated prematurely.",
      "He then became the first global superstar to move to Saudi Arabia when he signed a huge contract with Al Nassr in 2023. There had been speculation that he could leave the club this summer, before signing another huge extension, despite being in his 40s.",
      "Ronaldo has admitted that his legendary career is now into it's final stages, suggesting retirement will be on the cards in the next few years. Speaking in June, he said: \"My mentality is to live day by day. I don't have many more years to play…but I'm enjoying the moment.",
      "\"There's no day decided for my retirement. I feel happy, I'm here to enjoy and keep going until the day I [don't feel] like this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has endured a torrid start to life at Barcelona after producing what some are calling \"the miss of the season\". The Manchester United loanee netted his first goal for the club during their commanding 5-0 pre-season win against Daegu last week - but any positive momentum was quickly erased in Sunday's equally commanding 5-0 victory over Como, where he shockingly failed to score from just eight yards out with an open goal gaping.",
      "Following a clever through ball from Lamine Yamal, Rashford neatly jinked past the goalkeeper and a defender to leave himself with an easy finish. But instead of scoring, his left-footed shot agonizingly missed the target, rolling inches wide of the post. He was substituted a few minutes later.",
      "With Robert Lewandowski sidelined due to injury, Rashford has a golden chance to convince manager Hansi Flick that he is more than just a squad player. However, his glaring miss versus Como sparked major doubts about his quality, confidence, and suitability for the No. 9 position.",
      "Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo declared that \"it is clear he [Rashford] is not a natural No. 9.\" Meanwhile, AS went further, criticising his \"strange performance\" filled with \"notable errors in execution, especially in his attempt to provide continuity in the play with his back to goal.\"",
      "On the Spanish radio show El Larguero, commentator Jordi Marti said Rashford \"left me cold,\" expressing frustration: \"The expectations I had of him in that No. 9 position have left me cold. But I've seen him do better on the wing; when he takes on the ball, he does so with power and accurate assists.\"",
      "\"But today was an important day for him. Lewandowski will be out for the next few weeks, and these are the games he needs to take advantage of.\"",
      "After falling out with United manager Ruben Amorim, Rashford - who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa - made it clear he wanted to leave the club this summer, with Barcelona his top choice.",
      "The Catalan side initially targeted Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, but after those deals collapsed, they shifted their focus to Rashford. A loan agreement was quickly sealed, including a £30million option for Barcelona to sign the 27-year-old permanently next summer.",
      "Rashford's versatility played a significant role in the transfer, with Flick valuing his capacity to perform both as a striker and winger. However, he may have to wait before officially debuting, as Barcelona have yet to register him.",
      "The registration holdups stem from La Liga's Financial Fair Play rules, which consistently challenge the Catalan club. To add new players and extend contracts, Barcelona need to free up enough salary space.",
      "A breakthrough came when the issue involving Marc-Andre ter Stegen was resolved. His back injury and initial refusal to certify a long-term absence complicated the registration of new goalkeeper Joan Garcia. Ter Stegen's recent consent to sign a medical document has now paved the way for Garcia's registration, but Rashford's paperwork is still pending.",
      "Barcelona have until the end of August to finalise player registrations for the upcoming campaign. This means Rashford could still be included in the squad after the La Liga opener against Mallorca this weekend, even if he doesn’t play immediately.",

      "Harry Maguire reckons Manchester United have been too mentally weak to achieve success. The defender believes Ruben Amorim's squad must embrace the pressures that come with representing United if the club hopes to reclaim its position at the summit of English football.",
      "United haven't lifted the title since 2013, or claimed the Champions League since 2008. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Maguire identified the club's biggest hurdle as conquering the psychological battles within players' minds.",
      "He explained: \"I think it's mental strength, definitely. I think it has a big part to play. You've got to thrive off the pressure, and you've got to play like you're playing in a playground.",
      "\"And I think that's what we've struggled to find over the last 10 years. There has been a transition period, obviously, when Sir Alex (Ferguson) was here and we had the best team by far. And won all the trophies.",
      "\"But the transition period is, at the moment, the reality is that we're not the best team. And I think it's how people and how the lads can adapt to that level of scrutiny and to keep going through that scrutiny.\", reports the Daily Star.",
      "Maguire suggests evidence of United's difficulties can be seen in his own superior performances for England compared to his club displays. The centre-back attributes this disparity to the reality that every other Premier League side 'despises' United.",
      "He added: \"I think there's more scrutiny on Manchester United, just because more people in the country hate them. And that's just a fact. Everyone in the Premier League dislikes Manchester United, and they don't want to see them do well.",
      "\"So I think there is more scrutiny on Manchester United, whereas England, everyone gets together. Everyone.\"",
      "United kick off their new Premier League season with last season's runners-up Arsenal visiting Old Trafford. Amorim watched his side end pre-season with a 1-1 home draw against Fiorentina and pulled no punches when telling his players they must improve...and quickly.",
      "\"Today was a tough match,\" he told MUTV. \"It was important for us to take out the feeling of playing at Old Trafford. I think we had some difficulties, especially in the beginning of the first half, and in the beginning of the second half.",
      "\"They have a lot of mobility and we struggle to find the right moment to press. But then we controlled the game and I think we had a lack of fluidity in the game. We can do better.",
      "\"But I think it was a perfect game for preparation to show us we need to improve in different areas that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players who can make a play and elevate the stadium.\"",

      "Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund has left team-mates unconvinced by his qualities on the pitch. Hojlund, 22, has struggled for consistency at Old Trafford ever since his £72million move from Atalanta in the summer of 2023.",
      "Goals have been too few and far between for the striker in a red shirt. United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe even once used him as an example of a \"not good enough\" and \"overpaid\" player his regime had \"inherited\".",
      "Despite that criticism from the United hierarchy, this summer, Hojlund has insisted he was going to fight for his place. That was despite the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and, most significantly, new centre-forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, the Dane could soon reluctantly leave the club after falling down the pecking order, and it appears it might be time he moves on given the views of some in the United camp.",
      "Reports from talkSPORT have also stated AC Milan have come to the table as a potential suitor for the young striker.",
      "While Hojlund is not looked at in the same way as the so-called 'bomb squad' players Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho – who are all training separately from the rest of the squad – United head coach Ruben Amorim appears willing to allow him to leave.",
      "The Portuguese boss refused to give any assurances about Hojlund's future while they were on their pre-season tour of Chicago. When asked about Hojlund, Amorim said: \"The important thing is that people focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals.",
      "\"But I think not just the goals, but the way he (Hojlund) connects the play. Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed.",
      "\"The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us a lot to play better. And we are playing better because he is playing better.",
      "\"I am really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.",
      "\"The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.\"",
      "Hojlund was not included in United's most recent friendly against Fiorentina. On the day Sesko was paraded around Old Trafford, Amorim left the Dane out of his starting line-up and did not introduce him from the bench.",
      "Instead, Mason Mount was deployed as a false nine, while Cunha and Mbeumo were also both trialled in the position throughout the contest. Neither of the trio found the net and United's only goal of the game was an own goal from Fiorentina defender Robin Gosens.",
      "United would go on to win the game via a penalty shootout, in which Bruno Fernandes, Cunha, Diogo Dalot, Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo scored for them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The new Premier League season is just a few days away but the transfer fun doesn't end for a little longer. Deadline day isn't until September 1, meaning teams have three weeks from today to complete their summer business.",
      "Plenty of those big deals have already been done. Some were wrapped up early, such as Florian Wirtz's move to Liverpool and Joao Pedro's Chelsea switch, but others have taken a little longer.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres completed his move to Arsenal after the Gunners began their pre-season campaign, though he has had time to start two friendlies and score in one. Benjamin Sesko's Manchester United switch took a little longer, with the striker unveiled as United took on Fiorentina on Saturday, and a behind-closed-doors friendly could give him the opportunity to make his debut for the club.",
      "Liverpool have been te biggest spenders among Premier League clubs this summer, with Fulham the quietest in the market. Things could easily change in the coming weeks, though - especially if certain teams start the season slowly.",
      "The big what-if remaining this summer concerns Isak's future. Liverpool have already seen one bid rejected, but the Newcastle striker still appears keen on an Anfield move.",
      "The issue is that Newcastle are desperate not to sell. It's been a frustrating window for Eddie Howe's side when it comes to landing targets - with several players opting for moves elsewhere - and losing Isak would only add to the nightmare summer.",
      "Liverpool have sold Luis DIaz and Darwin Nunez, though, and have a hole in their attack. Newcastle would surely want a replacement sorted first, though - more on that later.",
      "If Isak does join Liverpool, he would likely become the most expensive signing in Premier League history. Jack Grealish once held that honour, and the England international might well act as a cautionary tale.",
      "Yes, Grealish helped current club Manchester City win the treble in 2022-23, but things have gone south since. He is very much surplus to requirements this summer, and will be allowed to leave if a suitable offer arrives.",
      "Everton looks like a good fit, and would give David Moyes a marquee signing for the first season at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Even a loan wouldn't be cheap, though, and the Toffees will need to decide wether their limited funds are better used elsewhere, but reports on Monday suggested they decided it is worth the gamble.",
      "Liverpool created chances in the Community Shield on Sunday, but were left wanting at the back at times. Despite the excitement of a potential deal for Isak, there will be some who feel a new centre-back is more important.",
      "Marc Guehi has already been the subject of a couple of Reds bids, though they've fallen short of Crystal Palace's valuation so far. Guehi only has one yet left on his contract, though, and a late offer could yet get the job done.",
      "\"Of course, for players of that calibre to leave on a free, it is a problem for a football club,\" Palace chairman Steve Parish said when asked about £50m-rated Guehi. \"There is no doubt about it unfortunately.\"",
      "Guehi might not be the only one leaving Selhurst Park this summer. He played on Sunday, as did Ebere Eze, but Eze remains a target for Arsenal.",
      "The Gunners have already signed Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres, among others. Eze would offer something different in the final third, though, and would allow the Gunners to cash in on Leandro Trossard.",
      "\"Let's see what happens in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks, but we are actively looking at options, as well there are a few players maybe that they have to leave as well so we'll be open to see what happens,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said after a weekend friendly win over Athletic Club.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur moved early to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, but James Maddison's injury could force them back into the market. Maddison will miss the majority of the season with an ACL injury which requires surgery, and Savinho is one of the players linked with a North London switch after that news broke.",
      "The winger impressed in flashes during his first Manchester City season. Pep Guardiola's side added Rayan Cherki over the summer, though, and te Frenchman appears more likely to get minutes this term.",
      "City would be looking to make a profit on the £34m they paid to sign Savinho from Troyes last summer. He is said to be open to an exit, too, so this is worth keeping an eye on.",
      "Manchester United sealed their Benjamin Sesko deal on Saturday, and now the task is offloading some fringe players. Marcus Rashford has already completeed a loan move to Barcelona, and Sancho might be next.",
      "Chelsea paid United to get out of a permanent move for the winger, who blew hot and cold on loan last term. Juventus continue to be linked, along with Serie A rivals Inter Milan, with a complex PSR situation developing.",
      "United are keen to comply with profit and sustainability rules by sending Sancho and others away. Juve also need to balance the books, though, and we may need to see exits for the likes of Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic before there's any movement in the other direction.",
      "Staying with United exits, Garnacho is another player who has potential suitors. Chelsea are believed to have agreed terms with the Argentine, but there's still work to be done on the fee.",
      "United wanted £70m for Garnacho back in January, and that was considered too steep for Chelsea and Napoli. A move to Stamford Bridge this summer could still happen, though.",
      "Ruben Amorim certainly appears to have no space for Garnacho, who was left out of pre-season matches. The same applies to left-back Tyrell Malacia, though there has been less interest in the former Feyenoord man.",
      "Chelsea have strengthened in attacking areas, with Estevao Willian joined by strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. The supporting cast could use some new blood, though, especially with Madueke moving on.",
      "It's for this reason that Garnacho might not be the only addition. Xavi Simons of RB Leipzig has been eyed for a while, and Leipzig's failure to qualify for Europe could make a deal possible.",
      "Chelsea have been keen to send a player the other way, though, and this is where the problems lie. Christopher Nkunku could ultimately return to his former club, but it sounds like he'd need to take a wage hit.",
      "If Leipzig are after a Simons successor, Elliott looks like a good fit. The England Under-21 star struggled for minutes at Liverpool last season, and Wirt'z arrival will make game time even harder to come by.",
      "Liverpool are looking for around £50m for the former Fulham man, though a lower initial sum plus a buy-back clause is another option. The Bundesliga may suit him well, too, especially if he gets the minutes denied him under Arne Slot.",
      "A big season in Germany might even offer Elliott an England opportunity as we approach the World Cup. Thomas Tuchel will have eyes on the Bundesliga already, with captain Harry Kane at Bayern Munich, and a strong campaign would be hard to ignore.",
      "Speaking of Liverpool players who might find themselves on the move, Tsimikas is way down the pecking order. Andy Robertson is still at Anfield and Milos Kerkez has joined the party, leaving Tsimikas as the odd man out.",
      "The Greek international has been of interest to Forest for a while. With Alex Moreno back at parent club Aston Villa after a loan at the City Ground, a new left-back seems like an obvious priority for Nuno's side.",
      "Forest will play Europa League football this season after rivals Crystal Palace lost an appeal against their European demotion. We may well see them become one of the busier sides in the market now that a resolution has arrived.",
      "It may be that Hojlund decides to stay and battle it out with Sesko for minutes at Old Trafford. If he decides against it, though, Milan could provide a way out.",
      "The Danish striker showed promise in his first Serie A spell at Atalanta, prompting Manchester United to break the bank to sign him. Milan would be paying considerably less than £72m, though.",
      "Juventus striker Vlahovic is another option for the Rossoneri. However, Hojlund may well come on lower wages and a hunger to make up for lost time.",
      "Back to Newcastle, who you'd imagine will need at least one new striker if Isak leaves. They may need one regardless, having allowed Callum Wilson - now at West Ham - to leave upon the expiry of his contract.",
      "Jackson missed out on Chelsea's last two 'weekender' friendlies amid reported interest. Delap and Joao Pedro have seen him relegated to the status of third-choice striker, but he could yet be reintegrated.",
      "The issue here is Chelsea's steep asking price. Newcastle are unlikely to be prepared to pay anywhere near the £80m the Blues want for a player who scored 10 league goals last term.",
      "If Newcastle only sign one striker, Wissa could well be the one. The Congolese star comfortably outscored Jackson last term despite playing for a mid-table finisher in Brentford, though he is a fair bit older than the Magpies' other target.",
      "Early offers in the region of £25m have been rejected by the Bees, both in January from Nottingham Forest and more recently. It looks like £35m could get the deal done, though.",
      "Wissa has been back in Brentford training and could yet feature against Forest in te league opener. It may well be a different story in September.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have completely revamped their attack in the summer transfer window, spending over £200million in an attempt to improve upon their dreadful 2024/25 campaign, but they are not done yet.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha (£62.5m from Wolves), Bryan Mbeumo (£71m from Brentford) and Benjamin Sesko (£74m from RB Leipzig). They have also welcomed left-back Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in a deal which could reach £7m.",
      "Amorim’s side begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday, but still have lots of business left to do before the transfer window closes on September 1. Having finished 15th and lost the Europa League final last season, improvements were obviously required and the club hope to get further additions through the door.",
      "Speaking earlier in the summer, Amorim explained the blueprint for their targets. “We want players who have proved [themselves] already,\" he said. “Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all those boxes with them, we are going to do it.”",
      "The next priority for the former Sporting Lisbon boss is a deep lying midfielder. Amorim fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in their final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday, but the veteran doesn’t have the legs to perform the role. Manuel Ugarte has been unconvincing since his £50m arrival from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, while Kobbie Mainoo is better as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Carlos Baleba is a transfer target for the position, but Brighton’s £100m valuation – backed up by the fact he has three years on his contract – may make that deal extremely difficult to conclude. They have previously been linked with Atalanta midfielder Ederson, who is valued at around £52m, and Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand, who Amorim knows well.",
      "The other main transfer priority is in goal, where Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have failed to convince. United have been linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Onana is expected to stay put and United would likely need to secure the exit of Bayindir before they signed a new goalkeeper. Lammens is the most realistic of the three aforementioned keepers, with Antwerp having already signed his replacement, although PSG are reportedly ready to wave goodbye to Donnarumma for a knockdown price.",
      "The problem for United is that they need to sell players before they can buy. Having started the summer with five members of their ‘bomb squad’, there are still four in situ, with Marcus Rashford the only one to leave so far and Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia still on the books.",
      "Garnacho is the subject of interest from Chelsea, who first enquired in January about the winger’s availability. He has agreed personal terms with the Blues over a permanent transfer but negotiations are ongoing over a transfer fee.",
      "Sancho had appeared close to joining Galatasaray and Juventus before those moves went quiet. He is still being linked with a move to Italy, with Inter Milan and Roma reportedly keen, while a return to Borussia Dortmund is a possibility.",
      "Antony wants to rejoin Real Betis, where he was on loan last season, but United are holding out for a permanent transfer for the highest price possible. Meanwhile, United have received little interest in Malacia, whose career with the club has been ruined by injuries.",
      "The arrival of Sesko has placed the future of Rasmus Hojlund in serious doubt. United are willing to sell the Danish striker for around £30m and there is interest from Italy in the form of AC Milan, where he still has a good reputation thanks to his spell at Atalanta.",
      "Another possible departure concerns Toby Collyer, who is well down the pecking order in Amorim’s squad. The midfielder didn’t make it off the bench against Fiorentina and could be sent out on loan in order to get regular game time; he and left-back Harry Amass are reportedly being targeted by crisis-stricken Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League bosses will have to learn THREE new law changes ahead of the 2025-26 season after organisers confirmed some pretty major tweaks. Preparations for the new campaign are already well underway.",
      "All 20 Premier League clubs start their seasons over the next week, with reigning champions Liverpool kicking off the new campaign on Friday as they welcome Bournemouth to Anfield.",
      "Pre-season friendlies and transfers have both been high on the agenda as the season approaches. And while that is set to continue - with the window open for another three weeks - work has also had to be put into learning some new laws of the game.",
      "Gone are the days of goalkeepers just simply holding onto the ball to kill time at the end of a game. There was previously a rule where goalkeepers would be under a time limit of six seconds and should they not release the ball then an indirect free kick would be given - albeit it was rarely enforced.",
      "But the Premier League have toughened up their approach. The time limit has actually increased to eight seconds but the referee will now warn goalkeepers with a five-second countdown.",
      "And should they fail to release the ball before that timer expires then a corner would be awarded to the opposing team. That news will be music to the ears of Liverpool boss Arne Slot, who complained at the amount of time wasting his side faced last season.",
      "He said: “Teams got to know us better and tried to find answers to our playing style. But one of the things you cannot do anything about is that tactics are being used that have nothing to do with football.",
      "“Delaying the start of the game, pretending you are injured, taking one minute for a free-kick, one minute for a throw-in. That is my main worry.",
      "“Every time we drop points, that happened… goalkeepers taking one and a half minutes. When we have dropped points, that tactic was used. I like to say it now after us winning the league, not losing a game.”",
      "After previously restricting the amount of players who could engage with referees, the Premier League have now made that rule stricter with only captains allowed to approach officials in matches this season.",
      "Referees have the power to caution players who approach officials without permission or who show disrespectful behaviour. Should a team’s captain be their goalkeeper, then they can provide an alternative player before a game.",
      "IFAB have suggested that this initiative is recommended but not compulsory - albeit the Premier League have chosen to adopt it. The approach was trialled in UEFA competitions last term.",
      "The final rule revolves around penalties - specifically in a situation where a player has touched the ball twice when taking a spot kick. Should a player score a penalty and accidentally touch the ball twice then the referee would award a retake.",
      "But the kick has to be clearly unintentional for that rule to be valid. Should the player miss, then the defending team would be given an indirect free kick.",
      "Ex-Man City forward Julian Alvarez slipped as he took a penalty against Real Madrid last season - but due to the previous rule, it was not retaken. The new law has already been utilised at the Women’s Euros as Beth Mead slipped and touched the ball twice in the process of scoring. She was ordered to retake the penalty but saw her second effort saved by Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll.",

      "Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez has confirmed he wants to stay in Catalunya, ending Manchester United's hopes of signing him. The Spaniard has been linked with an audacious move to Old Trafford throughout the transfer window.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim has been trying to add more options to his midfield, after mainly focusing on bolstering his attack. Recent reports claimed the Red Devils were plotting a £61million move for Lopez, who won a gold medal with Spain at the Paris Olympics.",
      "United have wrapped up the signings of Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves, young defender Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £71m and, most recently, Benjamin Sesko for £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons.",
      "However, they are looking for more creativity and energy in midfield, which was a huge weakness for United last season. Unfortunately for them, Lopez will not be the new spark the Red Devils are looking for.",
      "He scored an impressive brace as Barcelona comfortably beat Como 5-0 in a pre-season friendly. Speaking to reporters after the match, he confirmed his future will still be with the Catalans.",
      "Lopez said: \"It was a great game from the whole team that will be good for us. The work is non-negotiable, the pressure is high too, like last year, when we did very well. Let’s continue like this.”",
      "He added: \"I want to stay here. It’s my dream and I will stay, I’m happy to help the team. Many things have been said.",
      "\"But I am going to continue defending these colours and working as hard as anyone else, so that the Catalans are calm.”",
      "Despite Lopez's comments, the Red Devils appear to be prioritising a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is a different profile of midfielder. The Seagulls ace has recently been linked with a huge move to Old Trafford, after impressing with his classy performances under Fabian Hurzeler.",
      "The Cameroonian, who was signed from Lille soon after Chelsea bought Moises Caicedo for a then Premier League record £115m, is understood to be valued by Brighton at around £100m. United's valuation is significantly less than the Seagulls', as they believe a fee of around £70m would be fair.",
      "However, with three years left on his deal at the Amex Stadium, Brighton are in a position to command whatever fee they want for the midfield engine. With the likes of Casemiro coming to the end of his career and Manuel Ugarte struggling for consistency since his move from Paris Saint-Germain last year, United's need for a midfielder is glaring to some.",
      "The Red Devils' new-look squad will face an immediate acid test, as they face Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their first five matches of the campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been warned they need to move fast if they are to land Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. United are reportedly keen to sign Baleba in the summer transfer window, with Ruben Amorim chasing a holding midfielder for his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "United have reportedly made contact with Brighton to discuss the possibility of a transfer this summer. The Cameroon international has three years left on his Seagulls contract and is valued at £100million after a standout campaign.",
      "Amorim’s side have spent over £200m this summer to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They likely need to offload some of their unwanted players like Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho before moving for other targets.",
      "But Troy Deeney has warned them that Real Madrid could emerge as a rival for Baleba if they don’t move fast enough. Real are in the market for a central midfielder, and have been linked with Manchester City star Rodri, but Deeney thinks Baleba could fit the bill too.",
      "“I think United have to get Baleba this window, or they don’t get him,” Deeney said on talkSPORT. “If he has another good season, I do think other teams with Real Madrid and the like will come in and go ‘Bosh, we’ll have him’.",
      "“I think if Man United want him…if I’m Ruben Amorim I’m kind of bullish on that. I’d be saying ‘get this deal done because then I can get you into Europe’. If they can sign him, he can move them up 10 spaces [in the Premier League].”",
      "Brighton are no strangers to driving a hard bargain over their star players, having got good deals over Alexis Mac Allister, Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo and Joao Pedro in recent years. Speaking last week, chief executive Paul Barber played down the rumours around Baleba.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" he said. \"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him.",
      "\"We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "If Manchester United are to get their hands on Carlos Baleba this month, Brighton won't be left entirely high and dry. In fact, Fabian Hurzeler's squad may already boast the replacements needed to fill any void following reports of fresh talks with the Red Devils.",
      "Having invested around £200million in a new front three, United have turned their attention to strengthening their midfield – and Brighton's box-to-box enforcer leads their wish-list. The Sun report United are persevering in new talks with Baleba's representatives despite Brighton insisting on a fee to rival the £115m Chelsea paid to sign Moises Caicedo two years ago.",
      "It's all part of the process that has made the Seagulls the envy of many teams in the transfer market in recent years – recruit prospects young, build them into first-team stars, sell for a hefty profit, and repeat.",
      "With United keen on Brighton's latest top talent, Baleba appeared to send a subtle message to the club's fans over the weekend too, by giving a timely like to Leny Yoro's post on Instagram. The pair are good pals, having played at Ligue 1 side Lille together before Baleba left to sign for Brighton, and it remains to be seen if they will yet be reunited at Old Trafford.",
      "Just as Baleba has thrived in the role that once made the likes of Caicedo and Yves Bissouma such a success at the Amex Stadium, he too has successors-in-waiting. And just like Baleba, it may not take more than a season or two to make it clear Brighton may have unearthed even more special talent, at least if their model's recent success is anything to go by.",
      "Despite having yet to truly break through in England, midfield prospects Diego Gomez and Malick Yalcouye are the ones to watch in Baleba's position at the base of midfield. Gomez in particular has already made an impression following his £11m move from Inter Miami this past January.",
      "\"When I saw him running - he was running during our training sessions – I saw a beast,\" Hurzeler said of the player when speaking in January. \"[It] is unbelievable how intense he can play football, and he proved it in the MLS.",
      "\"Of course, it is a different league, different profile. But in the end, it is exactly that what we want to have – physicality. We needed this physicality.\" The German tactician went on to say he was \"really happy\" with the Paraguayan's attitude and \"really looking forward to working with him.\"",
      "Gomez, 22, made 16 Premier League appearances during the second half of last season and scored his first goal for the club on the final day of the campaign. He also boasts 15 senior caps for Paraguay already, having made his full international debut at 19.",
      "Yalcouye, 19, is in a different stage of his development having only made his debut for the Ivory Coast's Under-23s side this summer.",
      "The teenager joined Brighton in July 2024 from Swedish outfit Goteborg for £7.6m – meaning Yalcouye and Gomez only cost Brighton a collective £18.6m – before an impressive loan spell with Austrian side Sturm Graz last season.",
      "Mali-born Yalcouye offers slightly different dimensions at around 5'7\", though he offers a versatile game of his own. Despite joining Brighton as a central midfielder, he spent the majority of his time in Austria out wide on either wing, scoring four goals and contributing two assists in 26 league games.",
      "And it's not as though Hurzeler's midfield alternatives are restricted to the pair of prospects. Mats Wieffer, Matt O'Riley, Yasin Ayari and Jack Hinshelwood are among those to have shared midfield minutes with Baleba last season, with each capable of fulfilling more defensive duties in that area.",
      "None of that may influence Brighton's toughened stance over selling Baleba, but the volume of alternative solutions may make the south-coast club more appeasable to a deal.",
      "Nothing changes from United's perspective, meanwhile, as affording such a move towards the end of an already expensive window becomes their main priority. Amorim knows United need to offload more players this month, with Chelsea currently in talks over winger Alejandro Garnacho.",

The latest step involves a potential behind-closed-doors friendly, organised with a view to ensuring a pair of stars get the game time they need.",
      "United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been absent from recent pre-season friendlies as he works his way back to full fitness. The rest of the first team have also yet to play alongside new striker Benjamin Sesko, whose arrival from RB Leipzig was made official over the weekend.",
      "According to The Times, the Red Devils are exploring the prospect of a friendly at the Carrington training complex this week. The opposition has yet to be decided, but Ruben Amorim's side would likely face local opposition.",
      "If Onana is unable to return to full fitness for the Arsenal game, Altay Bayindir could make just his fifth Premier League appearance in his third United season. The Turkish international also played against the Gunners in last season's FA Cup, saving a shoot-out penalty from Kai Havertz.",
      "Sesko, meanwhile, missed Leipzig's friendly against Atalanta on August 2 and didn't join his new club in time to face Fiorentina on Saturday. United won the weekend friendly, prevailing on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" United boss Amorim told club media. \"Ben is a player - with all the information that we have - that we need to stop the guy from working, not the opposite!",
      "\"So that is also important. He's really young. He's good in the air, he's good at running the channels, good on the ball. I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot and, for sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He has the right character to be in this group, so I'm really happy to have him.\"",
      "United's rivals Arsenal were also winners over the weekend. New striker Viktor Gyokeres scored his first goal for the club as they beat Athletic Club 3-0 to win the Emirates Cup.",
      "\"Well I think his goals, his threat, I think he pins both centre backs, he's a player that when you're living with a space, one against one, he's going to destroy you,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said when asked what Gyokeres brings to the team. \"So he's going to create a lot of space as well for us and yeah, the moment that in any situation there is a player there that can score a goal.\"",

      "Manchester United misfit Alejandro Garnacho has hinted that his Old Trafford nightmare could soon be coming to an end. The Argentine forward has next to no future with the Red Devils having been told to find a new club by Ruben Amorim at the end of last season.",
      "A number of clubs have already been linked with Garnacho ahead of next month’s transfer deadline. Italian giants Napoli emerged as potential suitors earlier this summer but their interest appears to have cooled.",
      "United’s Premier League rivals Chelsea have also made a move, having agreed personal terms with the young forward - albeit they still have to come to an agreement with the Red Devils. And Garnacho himself has now teased that a breakthrough might not be too far away.",
      "The 21-year-old shared a picture of himself sitting in a gym with his head in his hands. And the emojis of a sand timer and ellipses were particularly telling.",
      "United are expected to demand around £40m for Garnacho’s services given he has just under three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. Speaking earlier this summer, boss Amorim made it clear that Garnacho was likely to move on.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” said Amorim. \"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",

      "Garnacho is unlikely to be the only departure from Old Trafford before the end of the window. Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund are all expected to leave.",
      "AC Milan have opened talks with United regarding the Danish striker’s services following the signing of Benjamin Sesko. Real Betis were also keen to re-sign Antony following last season’s loan spell but have struggled to get a deal over the line so far.",

      "Manchester United are heading back into the top five of the Premier League this season, according to Luke Littler. United finished a miserable 15th in 2024/25 as Ruben Amorim endured a dreadful debut campaign, but Littler is convinced he will turn things around.",
      "The club are attempting to rebuild after a dreadful start to the Amorim era which concluded with their lowest league finish since the 1989/90 campaign and with a defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim managed to secure just seven wins from 27 league games and his hapless side scored just 44 goals in 38 Premier League matches altogether after he took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "United have reacted by splashing over £200million to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer transfer window. There have been some encouraging performances in pre-season and United fan Littler is feeling upbeat ahead of their first match of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "“I’m very excited. I think we are underdogs,” he said. “Obviously from last season, I don’t think anything worse can happen – unless we finish 16th. But yeah, I think it is going to be a very interesting season. Most clubs won’t expect it but I’m expecting top five.”",
      "United have only finished in the top five in the Premier League once in the past four years, having fallen way behind their rivals. The defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final means they will not play in any European competition this season and will be able to solely concentrate on domestic matters.",
      "Amorim has tried to completely change the way United play, and despite poor results so far, he remains confident it will work eventually. “I know it's a massive gap from where we finished, but it's Manchester United. We need to return to Europe,” he told BBC Sport recently.",
      "Asked if they could win the Premier League and Champions League once more, Amorim replied: “I have no doubts. There are some things you cannot buy that this club has: pedigree, history, fans. We have money without the Champions League. With all these things, if we have a different culture, we can return to our place.”",
      "United completed their pre-season with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina on the weekend and Amorim believes he now has more options to choose from. “That (a selection headache) is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch,” he said.",
      "“This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "“It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.”",

      "The trophy is safely at Anfield after Arne Slot's side ran away with it last term, and now the challenge for the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City is to take it from them. Next is the battle for the Champions League, where Manchester United haven't been for two years.",
      "And what about the relegation scrap? We will see all three promoted teams go straight back down for the third year running?",

      "Young Player of the year: Ethan Nwaneri",
      "Andy Dunn: They won it in a ten-point canter last season and have done storming business in the transfer market so it really is hard to back against Liverpool retaining their Premier League title and against Mohamed Salah collecting another Golden Boot, especially when he will have the best signing of the window, Florian Wirtz, to help him out.",
      "You would expect Erling Haaland to rival Salah for the Golden Boot but the Manchester City striker might well find the going tough with a new-look side taking a good while to gel. City’s transitional period will mean Chelsea and Arsenal giving Liverpool the most to think about and with Cole Palmer pulling the strings, Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup champions should show improved Premier League form.",
      "Arsenal have also had a good summer of recruitment and I expect more big things from their brilliant youngsters, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, but they will still come up just short.",
      "Unfortunately, it will be another struggle for the three promoted clubs but Leeds United should have enough to survive. In his short time there, Graham Potter has yet to convince at West Ham United and they could be mildly surprising candidates for the drop at the end of the 2025-26 season.",

      "Florian Wirtz is a huge signing and I think he will have a starring role in their success to make him not only the best buy of the winner but a contender for player of the year. Manchester City will push them though as Pep Guardiola rebuilds his team but I expect them to find their peak again in the following campaign while Arsenal and Chelsea will fill up the rest of the top four.",
      "Who'll win the Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Burnley and Leeds will struggle to stay up but I reckon Sunderland may surprise a few with their new faces. Brentford have lost their manager and best players, they could be in trouble. Manchester United a surprise package? Only because they won’t be as awful as they were last season and will push for a top six spot.",
      "Erling Haaland will find his shooting boots again and edge out Mo Salah in the race with the latter to miss some games due to AFCON. Leny Yoro looks a promising defender and could star for United this term.",

      "Neil McLeman: There are four genuine contenders in the most open title race for years. Champions Liverpool and runners-up Arsenal have spent massively but the Man City rebuild began in January while years of Chelsea spending saw them win the FIFA Club World Cup last month. The after effects of playing a major summer of one of many unknowns this season.",
      "Arne Slot was superb in his first Anfield season but faces an arguably an even more difficult task in this campaign of integrating big money signings as title favourites. Pressure will start to build quickly on Mikel Arteta if the Gunners are not competing for silverware.",
      "Without European football, Ruben Amorin will have the chance to stamp his identity on Manchester United and can achieve a top-six finish. But another summer of slow transfer activity at Selhurst Park threatens to make Crystal Palace’s first full European campaign a big challenge after their historic FA Cup success.",
      "Any promoted side staying up is now a minor miracle. Will Burnley’s more pragmatic defensive solidity be more successful in the top flight than Vincent Kompany’s more open approach back in 2023-24? Can Marc Guiu save Sunderland? And how long will Daniel Farke last at Leeds?",

      "Arsenal also look stronger and I fancy they will be Liverpool's closest challengers, making it more of a race than last term. A change of scenery could be just the tonic for Noni Madueke as he bids to nail down a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Manchester City don't look quite ready to reclaim their crown, although I think Erling Haaland will return to the top of the goal charts, fitness permitting. Chelsea to complete the rest of the top four.",
      "At the other end, I think we will have more of a battle on our hands in the race to stay afloat. Leeds and Burnley look more well-equipped than promoted sides from the last couple of years to retain their top-flight status. A whole host of clubs could be in the mix, including Wolves and Everton, but I've plumped for Brentford and West Ham to join Sunderland in the drop zone.",
      "The Bees in particular have had a disappointing summer, losing boss Thomas Frank to Spurs and main marksman Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United. I think rookie manager Keith Andrews has a real job on his hands to maintain the club's upward trajectory.",
      "Florian Wirtz looks like being the Premier League's newest superstar and I think he will be right in the mix for Player of the Year come next May. Myles Lewis-Skelly is in a great position to continue his development and will be one of the favourites to scoop the Young Player award.",

I expect Manchester City to put up a much better challenge this time around, but I'm backing Arne Slot to do what Jurgen Klopp couldn't - and go back to back.",
      "And with that, I can’t look past Mo Salah winning another Golden Boot and being the best player in the division. Jeremie Frimpong will also slot in seamlessly at right back and perhaps offer what his predecessor Trent Alexander-Arnold didn’t.",
      "Arsenal will still be comfortably in the top four, but I don't anticipate them being as close when it comes to the title race. Their transfer business doesn't inspire me and I wouldn't be surprised if they fall off slightly.",
      "That being said, 25/26 promises to be a huge season for Ethan Nwaneri. He should become an even more important part of Mikel Arteta’s squad and will make it into Thomas Tuchel’s England World Cup squad.",
      "At the other end of the table, there's no doubt the three promoted sides will put up a better first of staying up than in previous years, but until I see otherwise, I still think the gap will prove too much - despite their spending.",
      "Wolves have lost plenty of talent during the window, but the acquisition of Jhon Arias should reap immediate benefits. He looked one of the better players at the Club World Cup and could hit the ground running.",

Liverpool are unlikely to be as comfortable as they were last term, but I’m anticipating Manchester City and Chelsea’s Club World Cup exploits to leave them just behind the reigning champions and last season’s runners-up Arsenal.",
      "At the other end of the table, West Ham weren’t far above the drop zone last term and have lost Mohammed Kudus without a replacement coming in, leaving relegation as a real concern. Elsewhere, James Trafford’s Man City return is likely to damage Burnley and Sunderland will need a flurry of new signings to hit the ground running if they are to survive.",
      "Speaking of hitting the ground running, Liverpool’s record signing Florian Wirtz should be key to their success. I’m predicting the opposite on the other side of Merseyside, though - David Moyes had a horrible record with big-money signings at West Ham, and I fear the same could happen with Everton new boy Thierno Barry.",
      "Brentford need some players to step up after more high-profile exits, and I’m backing Igor Thiago to make up for his lost year, though I don’t see anyone catching Erling Haaland in the golden boot race now that his supply line has been bolstered.",
      "Finally, Spurs will surely improve on last season’s league showing, and Archie Gray - still just 19 - has a chance to enjoy a more settled second season under new boss Thomas Frank.",

      "Daniel Orme: Liverpool were by far and away the best team in the league last season - and a lucrative summer has only made the champions even stronger. Given the new faces that they have welcomed to Anfield, it would be fair to say that they’ve once again got the strongest squad on paper which should be enough to see them win the league once again.",
      "That should also see Salah thrive and win the Player of the Year and while Gakpo is not an unknown quantity, I reckon he could hit even bigger heights and even be in the running for that gong too.",
      "But the same might not be said of summer arrival Hugo Ekitike. The Frenchman is far from a bad signing but he will need some adaptation and might not get as many goals as his lofty price tag suggests. Among their rivals, Erling Haaland and Rayan Cherki should sign, while Viktor Gyokeres will catch the eye for Arsenal.",
      "Meanwhile, two of the three promoted clubs will drop back into the Championship and might well be joined by Brentford, who have taken a massive risk by replacing Thomas Frank with Keith Andrews. The exit of Bryan Mbeumo and the potential departure of Yoanne Wissa haven’t helped.",

      "Oli Gamp: It would have been hard for me to go against Liverpool for the title even if they had made zero signings. After splurging £300m - and on some terrific new signings - they look dead certs to lift the Premier League crown once again.",
      "I feel in particular the £116m addition of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen will turn them into an even more lethal force. Mark my words, Wirtz will be known as 'The Locksmith' after this season because he's demonstrated how he can unlock even the tightest of defences and make things happen. In the last two seasons alone, he has 34 goals and 28 assists. He's quite simply a weapon and that's reflected in me backing him for best signing and POTY.",
      "Man City should push Liverpool close after strengthening too and while Arsenal have made good signings in this window, I feel they will come up short once again in what could be a crossroads moment for Mikel Arteta next summer. It seems like the right time for Alexander Isak to push on and show why he is one of Europe's best strikers right now and he could add to his 27 strikes from last season, especially if he joins Liverpool.",
      "I also feel Leeds will break the hoodoo of promoted teams going straight back down after some good additions that have gone under the radar and their existing quality, but time could be up for Brentford after losing Thomas Frank. And while I think Arsenal will have a disappointing season, I can see Ethan Nwaneri dazzling individually and showing why he is one of the brightest talents we have in this country.",

      "Young player of the year: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "Alan Smith: The chasing pack will put up a bigger challenge than last season but Arne Slot's squad is stronger and could be boosted further. The only weakness appears a lack of depth at centre half, meaning an injury to Virgil van Dijk or Ibrahima Konate could derail them. Once they are available the Reds have to be favourites.",
      "Pep Guardiola's revamped midfield will see them climb to second above Arsenal while Chelsea will be fourth in a tightly-packaged group.",
      "It is becoming a familiar, concerning pattern but the promoted three appear likely to go straight back down. Their only chance of surviving is if an established club ends up in turmoil.",
      "West Ham need more additions in the transfer window, while the demands of European football could mean a regression at Nottingham Forest. Yet both should still be better than the new boys.",
      "Erling Haaland will be top scorer as City fall just short, while Mohamed Salah will again be player of the year because Liverpool’s new firepower should distract opposition defences.",

      "Scott Trotter: Arsenal's pre-season hasn't been too convincing but it has to be their year at some point, right? Liverpool may have introduced too many changes, while Manchester City have some catching up to do after last season.",
      "Chelsea may have a tougher time than many expect too with greater competition to come in the Champions League and a big squad still to manage, though they may be best placed for fourth place unless Aston Villa make some smart moves. Florian Wirtz will light up the league once Liverpool settle but they could have too much to do if Viktor Gyokeres hits the ground running.",
      "Manchester United will not be as bad as last season, and could find some fluency with one game each week but still some way off competing with the best. A scenario that will leave nobody quite content after they had one eye on relegation last season.",
      "Brighton could push into the European spots as a period of stability sees them take advantage of those with busier schedules, while the teams promoted from the Championship will inevitably face a tough time. Vitor Pereira could spring a surprise with Wolves, along with Jorgen Strand Larsen, and despite their high-profile exits should enjoy a safe year.",

      "Sam Meade: City, after their year off, will come back with renewed motivation and I think that'll be enough to get them over the line. Liverpool still look electric, but if they do land Alexander Isak I start to wonder where all of the pieces of the jigsaw fit in. Newcastle, even if they lose their talisman, are incredibly well coached and could spring a surprise despite their poor summer.The feeling around West Ham isn't great, but Graham Potter showed time and time again that he was able to maximise his resources at Brighton. I've got big wraps on Cherki, who looked sensational for Lyon against Manchester United in Europe last year, and looks every inch a Pep Guardiola player.Nwaneri has come on every year and, with injuries to Arsenal's frontline last year, probably saw his development accelerated. His team-mate Myles Lewis-Skelly gets a lot of attention, and rightly so, but Nwaneri's ability to influence big moments in games is something to keep an eye on.",

      "Young player of the year: Ethan Nwaneri",
      "Felix Keith: Liverpool have recruited brilliantly so far this summer and look – at paper at least – stronger than last year. I’m backing Mohamed Salah to shine again, partly because he was my only accurate prediction last season. Milos Kerkez was awesome for Bournemouth last season and is a major upgrade on Andy Robertson, who was shaky at times in 2024/25.",
      "This time last year I tried to be clever and looked beyond just predicting the promoted teams to go straight down and I won’t make that mistake again.",
      "Newcastle look a mess this summer and, if they lose Alexander Isak it will become even worse. Kevin Schade is going to step up and bang at Brentford after Bryan Mbeumo left.",

      "Top goalscorer: Erling Haaland",
      "Player of the year: Cole Palmer",
      "Young player of the year: Willian Estevao",
      "Dan Marsh: It's hard to look past Liverpool again, isn't it? They were lightyears ahead of the rest last year. And the fact they've added three top quality players with Alexander Isak still in their sights means it would take a very brave (or foolish) person not to back them for successive titles.",
      "Manchester City will recover from their 2024-25 malaise to challenge them, while I fancy Chelsea to stick around longer this year. Maybe I've got it all wrong, but I see them both finishing ahead of Arsenal, who will take the last Champions League spot.",
      "At the other end of the table, I think Burnley and Leeds will succumb to the current trend of newly promoted teams plummeting straight back down. I worry for Brentford, too: losing your star man (Bryan Mbeumo), captain (Christian Norgaard) and Thomas Frank in one summer is absolutely rotten luck. Keith Andrews might go on to be a fine head coach but he's got a daunting task ahead of him this season.",
      "I fancy Everton to emerge as the season's surprise package. David Moyes did a fine job after returning last season and I like the signings of Thierno Barry and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. On the other hand, I think Viktor Gyokeres will struggle to replicate the magnificent goalscoring feats that made him such hot property at Sporting Lisbon. I'm backing Florian Wirtz to establish himself as the summer's shrewdest acquisition, even with that £116million transfer fee.",
      "Erling Haaland will reign supreme in the battle for the golden boot (not exactly breaking news but y'know) while Cole Palmer will be the leading light for Chelsea, who I think are in store for a strong season. Willian Estevao, the exciting young attacker who shone at the Club World Cup, is my outsider pick for Young Player of the Year (everyone else had Lewis-Skelley or Nwaneri!).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There was a slightly surreal interaction on North State Street in Chicago during Manchester United's pre-season tour. While walking back from a CVS pharmacy one evening, it soon became apparent I was gaining on a few United players out for an evening stroll.",
      "Harry Maguire was the most conspicuous. Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw were in front of him. Suddenly, there was a whistle and someone left behind jogged past me to catch up with the group: Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Hojlund muttered something and then, awkwardly, Maguire started to slow down. He turned around.",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "Possibly the three most oft-used words during interactions between British males. That was the sum of my 'night out' with United players.",
      "Reading between the lines, Hojlund had clocked me and made his teammates aware. Fernandes and Shaw did not even break stride. Maguire was perfectly polite.",
      "Hojlund was bound to recognise me as he once dedicated an Instagram post to me. Piqued by a story that some United players were reluctant to pass the ball to him, two days later he came on and scored the winner against Newcastle United and commemorated the moment on social media.",
      "On the pitch, Hojlund opted for a 'shhh' celebration, pressing his index finger against his lips. He did not silence the doubters last season. Hojlund scraped three goals in his final 35 appearances of 2024-25 and United are now brazenly pushing him out when they were once so protective.",
      "United were angry (on Hojlund's behalf) over the aforementioned story. Another member of their communications department has never celebrated more wildly in a press box than when Hojlund ended his goal drought at Leicester in March.",
      "Hojlund is not short of allies but he is now isolated. He started ball juggling during his warm up in the first half against Fiorentina on Saturday. That was a tell-tale sign he was never going to get on.",
      "In Chicago, Ruben Amorim refused to give assurances that Hojlund, who performed decently on tour, would stay. A few minutes later, Hojlund strolled into the mixed zone and asked if anyone wanted to talk to him. It was not lighthearted.",
      "One club cannot house two £70m-odd strikers. Benjamin Sesko's fee is marginally more than Hojlund's two years ago. Both are overpriced but Sesko's value feels fairer, given his development and reputation. He has been on United's radar for at least three years, too.",
      "Hojlund is an easy fall guy for the Ineos cabal. He was signed by the previous regime, Sir Jim Ratcliffe included him among the players that he had \"inherited\" and Hojlund's record is indefensible: 26 goals in 95 appearances.",
      "Admittedly, he started both seasons recovering from an injury. After he returned from a hamstring tear in September, Hojlund did not sustain another injury. Hojlund started 38 fixtures and his longest run on the bench was two games in 2024-25.",
      "He was never good enough to lead the line for United and was always destined to fail. The final fee of £64m up front rising to £72m contradicted United's brief that they would not break £60m for their new centre forward.",
      "Switching to the same agency that represented the manager heaped more pressure onto Hojlund. Erik ten Hag would have preferred Harry Kane but Ten Hag told confidants Hojlund had a \"proven goalscoring profile\". He didn't.",
      "Then there was the support striker, Anthony Martial. If you literally leant on Martial for support, he would break something. The Frenchman was as durable as a collection of bamboo sticks and did not play once for United in his final five months at the club.",
      "There were glimpses that Hojlund could be a long-term frontman. He unnerved William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes on his debut at Arsenal, plundered five goals in four Champions League starts and was the Premier League Player of the Month in February 2024 with five goals in four games. Hojlund was so pivotal that his muscular injury at the end of that month preceded United's home defeat to Fulham which ended their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons. They had to bring in a new No.9. So Hojlund had to make way.",
      "The noises from the hierarchy were unkind. One high-profile figure questioned Hojlund's work rate. The hesitancy to play the ball to Hojlund was never more public than when Diogo Dalot decided against crossing to him against Real Sociedad.",
      "Marcus Rashford's cousin derided Hojlund's pressing and how often he lost challenges. Another senior teammate shook his head at United's striker options and sighed, \"F*****g hell.\"",
      "The direction of travel has been that Hojlund would end up travelling elsewhere. Yet, if or when he does, United do not have a senior striker to provide back up for Sesko.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, scorer of seven goals in 49 games, is not a No.9 and not an outright No.10. Football's pseudo-intellectuals might dub him a 'nine-and-a-half'. Ie. neither here nor there.",
      "Zirkzee has been injured for practically four months. He has not had a kick in pre-season and was rushed back from a hamstring injury for the Europa League final. That told everyone what Amorim thought of Hojlund.",
      "United have a lighter work load this season and require a lighter squad. Chido Obi decamped to the first team in February but is only 17 and does not have a locker in the new Carrington dressing room yet. Instead, he is in the \"halfway house\" changing area reserved for emerging talent.",
      "Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo through the middle in United's last two friendlies. He has auxiliary options.",
      "However much longer Hojlund remains at United, he is likely to be left behind.",

      "The new season is upon Manchester United and they have three new forwards to pit against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival eight days before United's opening Premier League fixture is well timed. United head coach Ruben Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo up front in United's friendly draws with Fiorentina and Everton.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester on Thursday and he has already dined at Spinningfields and San Carlo as he settles into his new home. More importantly, he will have had a full week to familiarise himself with his new teammates at Carrington.",
      "Here are some talking points from Sesko's first training session at United:",
      "United uploaded pictures from their post-Fiorentina training session on Monday but they are dated Sunday August 10. So the session took place the day after the 1-1 draw.",
      "The day after a match is a recovery day for starters. Bruno Fernandes was captured by club photographers but he looks more like a ball-boy than a participant.",
      "Every substitute who came on against Fiorentina (Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot) is accounted for. So are unused substitutes Tom Heaton, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, Toby Collyer, Diego Leon and Dermot Mee.",
      "The only substitute not visible in the imagery is Rasmus Hojlund. That seems somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "Sesko will have had a full week of training to prepare for the Arsenal match. United players are bullish about the new season partly due to the ample recovery time they will have between matches in the absence of any European football but August is always a sparse month.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko played 45 minutes for RB Leipzig during their pre-season schedule and that was on July 19, so he is short of minutes. Amorim has ensured the majority of United's core squad members have had sufficient playing time over their five friendlies (Fernandes and Amad were the only two to start all five friendlies) and United looked fitter than they had done in pre-season for several years.",
      "Yet with Hojlund out in the cold, Joshua Zirkzee only just back from injury and no other senior striker, Sesko has to start. A full week at Carrington should stand him in good stead.",
      "Defender Noussair Mazraoui remains an injury concern ahead of United's Premier League opener.",
      "The Morocco international missed United's final four games of pre-season after featuring in the first half of their opening friendly of the summer against Leeds United just over three weeks ago.",
      "Despite travelling to the United States for the club's pre-season tour, he played no part in any of their Premier League Summer Series fixtures and was last pictured training two days before the tour opener against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Since the United squad returned to England early last week, the club has not uploaded any training images or footage of the defender, meaning he could miss out on Sunday.",
      "With plenty of first-team players not taking part in the session, United boosted the numbers by including some academy players. Among those pictured were Jaydan Kamason, Fredricson, Rhys Bennett, Jacob Devaney, Sekou Kone, James Scanlon, Ethan Ennis, Ethan Williams and Bendito Mantato.",
      "Fredricson was the only player from the aforementioned list to be included in the matchday squad against Fiorentina, but he failed to make it off the bench.",

      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw - the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches. Head coach Ruben Amorim elected to start playmaker Mason Mount up front, having played Matheus Cunha there in the 2-2 draw with Everton six days earlier.",
      "The MEN revealed last week sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave if Sesko came in. Hojlund is unhappy at United seemingly forcing him out and stressed only 12 days ago that he wanted to remain at the club. Amorim refused to give public assurances that Hojlund would stay.",
      "International players are under more pressure to ensure they have regular playing time this season ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Hojlund has scored one goal in his past 16 appearances for Denmark and was dropped to the bench for their last qualifier against Lithuania.",
      "United signed Hojlund from Atalanta in a £72m deal in July 2023, having planned not to break the £60m barrier for their new frontman. Hojlund has scored 26 goals in 95 games for the club.",
      "Milan would provide familiar territory for Hojlund as the city is located around 40 kilometres from Bergamo, where Atalanta are based.",

      "Benjamin Sesko hopes to emulate his \"idol\" Zlatan Ibrahimovic and lead Manchester United to success this season.",
      "Sesko completed a £73.62million transfer to United from RB Leipzig on Saturday and could make his debut in their opening Premier League fixture of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "When asked by club media which former United strikers he most admired, Sesko mentioned Ibrahimovic, who spent just under two seasons at the club under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ibrahimovic scored 28 goals in his first campaign with United as they won the League Cup and the Europa League to return to the Champions League, a competition Sesko played in with Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig.",
      "\"Since I've been small I've been watching him, every single YouTube video I can find, because he is amazing for me,\" Sesko told club media. \"We don't have the same, let's say, character but I like to see the way he plays, the way he enjoys football. If you enjoy football then everything works.",
      "\"It's just basically been my dream to one day meet him, that would be great. In general, he's my idol. (I've been) trying to take some stuff from him, especially some similarities with high kicks and power strikes.",
      "\"We are not the same, we have different playing styles but if there is any situation I try to do like he did.\"",
      "Sesko also expressed his admiration for Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, members of the last title-winning squad at United in 2013. Van Persie spent three years at the club while Rooney became United's record goalscorer before ending his 13-year spell in Manchester in 2017.",
      "\"For me, it's Van Persie, Rooney, all those kinds of guys,\" Sesko added of the former United forwards he admires. \"I've been watching them on videos. They've been great. I can admire them a lot and show myself in a good light here and try to help the team, help the club to be as high as possible.\"",
      "Sesko trained with his new teammates for the first time on Monday, having arrived in Manchester on Thursday.",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have announced that they will be scrapping their plans to protest against Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos prior to this weekend's opening-day fixture against Arsenal.",
      "The fan group who have been responsible for a number of protests against the Glazers in recent years announced last week that they were planning to hold their first against Ratcliffe on the opening-game weekend. The British petrochemicals billionaire has come under scrutiny since arriving at the club and strengthening the Glazers' hand at the club by purchasing minority shares in the Reds.",
      "Ratcliffe has also been responsible for a number of controversial cost-cutting measures which have included major redundancies and the reallocation of long-standing season ticket holders. However, in a statement first reported by PA, The 1958 confirmed the protest has been postponed due to a split within their membership.",
      "\"With a fanbase as diverse and passionate as ours, finding the right balance isn't always easy,\" they explained.",
      "\"We've had to consider momentum, timing, fan appetite, broader consequences of protest activity while assessing how current and future decisions may impact us as fans.",
      "\"Given the current sentiment within the fan-base and particularly in light of these recent survey results, it's clear there's no unified view on the direction of the club under Ratcliffe. That split is real, and we believe it would be irresponsible to risk creating a situation that could result in any 'red on red' conflict inside or outside the stadium.\"",
      "The 1958 also confirmed - in a poll of nearly 26,000 members - 63 per cent agreed that Ratcliffe should be held accountable by means of protest. However, 68 per cent also believed Ratcliffe and Ineos should be given more time to make their impression.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, August 11.",
      "The Reds have played their final pre-season fixture of the summer this weekend, drawing 1-1 with Fiorentina at Old Trafford before winning a penalty shootout. Now, all the attention turns to the new Premier League campaign and the visit of Arsenal a week today.",
      "One man who could be involved is Benjamin Sesko after he was unveiled to the United fans at Old Trafford on Saturday prior to the clash with the Italian giants. His arrival has led to more question marks surrounding Rasmus Hojlund who did not feature against Fiorentina.",

      "Take a look at all the latest United transfer news throughout the day, below...",

      "Until then, good night!",
      "Chelsea are currently working hard to bring Garnacho to Stamford Bridge this summer.",
      "The Argentine is believed to have agreed personal terms with the Blues and now it is just the small matter of a transfer fee needing to be agreed.",
      "If United were concerned that Chelsea did not have the finances available to reach their asking price, they could be in luck.",
      "Omari Hutchinson appears to be gaining plenty of interest including from Nottingham Forest.",
      "It is claimed that Chelsea hold a 25 per cent sell-on clause in the agreement that saw the winger leave for Ipswich Town. This means an unexpected windfall could be on its way to the Blues in time for them to wrap up a move for Garnacho.",
      "Speaking in a press conference today, Besiktas' president Serdal Adali has insisted that his club are interested in reuniting Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with Sancho.",
      "Adali explained:",
      "I want it as much as the club wants it. I've said this about other transfers as well. A player's decision to come to Turkey is crucial. We don't have the luxury of buying every player we want for a large sum. We have the budget, too. I want it more than our fans. We'll do everything we can to bring him here. It's important that the player wants to come to Turkey and Besiktas. We don't want to force anyone to come because of money. We will enforce every condition.",
      "According to journalist Alan Nixon, Championship club Hull City are interested in signing Toby Collyer on loan this summer.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been linked with the midfielder this summer and MEN Sport understands that despite his wishes to stay and fight for his place, Collyer has been informed that a loan move is best for his development.",
      "Collyer featured for the first team last season in the Premier League.",
      "Speaking over the weekend, Fabrizio Romano seemed adamant that United are working hard to get Baleba in this summer.",
      "He claimed the club are speaking 'again and again' with the midfielder's representatives.",
      "These talks are thought to focus on his wage and his potential desire to move to United.",
      "According to The Standard, United have reportedly seen a bid for Baleba rejected by Brighton which included Toby Collyer as part of the exchange.",
      "While this initially seems as a negative, it is claimed that United have been buoyed by Brighton's plans.",
      "It is understood that the Seagulls are already planning a succession plan for Baleba this summer which could suggest that they are ready to let him leave, should they receive the right offer.",
      "While PSG may be bracing themselves for a bid from United for Donnarumma, it seems unlikely that one will be forthcoming.",
      "MEN Sport understands that a move for the Italian is very unlikely this summer considering the money they have already spent this window.",
      "Plus, Onana has already received reassurances that his place as Amorim's first choice remains the case.",
      "Over the weekend, it was rumoured that PSG were bracing themselves for bids for Donnarumma.",
      "They expect that United will be one of the clubs interested in signing the Italian.",
      "The Daily Mirror believe that PSG could accept a fee of as little as £26m for the goalkeeper which could encourage United to bid.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma's forceful exit from PSG continues after he was not included in their squad for Wednesday night's Super Cup clash with Tottenham.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano is adamant that Donnarumma will 100 per cent leave the Champions League holders this summer.",
      "Donnarumma's camp meanwhile are disappointed by what they deem to be an 'unfair' handling of the situation by PSG.",
      "There was a slightly surreal interaction on North State Street in Chicago during Manchester United's pre-season tour. While walking back from a CVS pharmacy one evening, it soon became apparent I was gaining on a few United players out for an evening stroll.",
      "Harry Maguire was the most conspicuous. Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw were in front of him. Suddenly, there was a whistle and someone left behind jogged past me to catch up with the group: Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Hojlund muttered something and then, awkwardly, Maguire started to slow down. He turned around.",
      "\"All right, mate.\"",
      "MORE HERE",
      "MEN Sport understands that Hojlund is keen to join AC Milan this summer.",
      "The Reds are confident that a deal can be struck with the Italian giants for the Dane but it is unclear if a permanent deal could be salvaged.",
      "If it can, United are looking for £30m for the striker.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog on this Monday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the remainder of today, bringing you all the latest United news in the process.",
      "Speaking of, let's take a closer look at the news that Matty shared moments ago surrounding this man...",
      "Manchester United could have the perfect opportunity to agree a swap deal in the near future.",
      "The signing of Benjamin Sesko could go on to have major ramifications in the United squad. The Reds signing the striker from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million with add-ons, with Sesko now expected to lead the line for the season ahead.",
      "The decision to sign Sesko has led to speculation around Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee's future at Old Trafford. In particular, it seems that Hojlund could be set to leave the club in light of Sesko's arrival.",
      "If United were to convince Milan that a permanent move is the best for all parties, it could present an opportunity for the Reds to get a swap deal on the cards. This is because Milan may have a player who may be of interest to United",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Manchester United know they're a midfielder away from having a hugely competitive starting XI after addressing some key flaws in their squad. The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have given Ruben Amorim a completely new-look starting front three.",
      "They'll need time to bed into their new surroundings at Old Trafford, but the general consensus is they're ready-made signings who can have an instant impact. United will want to avoid a repeat of last season's dismal campaign and the signing of a defensive midfielder could play a major part in that.",
      "Given there'll be no European football for United this season, they can focus on the Premier League and winning some domestic silverware. Recent transfer speculation linking the club with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba are exciting links.",
      "The club is crying out for a holding midfielder who can protect the back three and stop the XI being so vulnerable in transition. However, given Brighton have slapped a reported £100million asking price on the Cameroonian's head, the club know they need to offload a number of fringe players before investing that kind of money.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Marcus Rashford faces a race against time to be registered for Barcelona's La Liga opener against Mallorca this weekend. The La Liga club are working to register new players for said game, but the Manchester United loanee is a doubt to feature given the club's ongoing financial struggles.",
      "Barca president Joan Laporta told TV3: \"We're working to make it happen. With Marc's decision, we have the option of registering Joan Garcia, and we're working on the rest. This week we'll have news, hopefully good news, to see if we can register them before La Liga starts. And if we can't, we have time.”",
      "Football Insider claims Manchester United are still keeping an eye on Harry Kane's future at Bayern Munich this summer.",
      "Pete O'Rourke said:",
      "Obviously if a player like Harry Kane is willing to come back to the Premier League, there will be clubs very much interested. The big question is which English club will be looking to bring him back to the Premier League?",
      "“Obviously, he’s the second-highest goalscorer in the Premier League behind Alan Shearer, so that might be in his mind to come back and break that record. He’s got a release clause which decreases the closer it gets to the end of his Bayern Munich contract.",
      "“So he could be available from January for around £56million, which would be a bargain for somebody like Harry Kane. The only negative is his age, he’s 32 now and will be 33 next season, will any of the elite clubs be willing to go out and sign him?",
      "“If Harry Kane does become available next summer, there’ll be clubs that will be interested because he is guaranteed goals. Man United have consistently been linked with him, even in the last couple of seasons of his time at Tottenham before he moved to Bayern Munich.",
      "“I’m sure that interest is still there because he has been a long-term target for them. Any move is a way away, there will be more talk about this from January onwards into next summer, but for now his focus is on Bayern Munich.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko hopes to emulate his \"idol\" Zlatan Ibrahimovic and lead Manchester United to success this season.",
      "Sesko completed a £73.62million transfer to United from RB Leipzig on Saturday and could make his debut in their opening Premier League fixture of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "\"Since I've been small I've been watching him, every single YouTube video I can find, because he is amazing for me,\" Sesko told club media. \"We don't have the same, let's say, character but I like to see the way he plays, the way he enjoys football.

      "\"It's just basically been my dream to one day meet him, that would be great. In general, he's my idol. (I've been) trying to take some stuff from him, especially some similarities with high kicks and power strikes.",
      "\"We are not the same, we have different playing styles but if there is any situation I try to do like he did.\"",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Reported Manchester United transfer target Fermin Lopez has made the decision to remain at Barcelona and reject interest elsewhere.",
      "\"Barcelona fans should rest, because I will stay here... I will not leave Barca,\" he told reporters on Sunday, after Barcelona beat Como 5-0.",
      "\"It was a game about building confidence ready for the start of La Liga. The important thing is the team did a very good job.\"",
      "Former Manchester United star Eric Djemba-Djemba has urged Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to Footy Africa, Djemba-Djemba said: \"Baleba is currently among the top defensive and box-to-box midfielders in the Premier League, and joining Manchester United wouldn’t surprise me at all.",
      "\"It would be a masterstroke of a deal for both the player and Manchester United. He's a massive passer and a shield to the backline, but also great going upfront, which is what Ruben Amorim desires. Baleba would also improve his game working in a project under a whole new rebuild.",
      "\"For me, that would only spell good news for Cameroon to be honest. The only negative about this deal is that Brighton would be losing a massive asset. He's such a beast, yet he also has the ability to pass at range and shoot.\"",
      "Chelsea are set to battle with Manchester United for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer, according to to RMC Sport.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side are in the market for a new No.1 and have expressed an interest in signing the Italy international before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "While both Chelsea and United have enquired about his situation, they haven't made formal contact with his entourage.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is open to joining AC Milan.",
      "United are confident a deal can be struck with Milan, who are rebuilding their squad following the return of coach Massimiliano Allegri. Milan finished eighth last season and failed to qualify for Europe.",
      "It remains unclear whether a permanent deal could materialise as United value Hojlund at around £30million and Milan are seeking a loan move for the 22-year-old.",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United but the club decided early this calendar year to cash in if they recruited a new centre forward.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United will need to make a \"crazy\" offer to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton this summer, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano. The 21-year-old has emerged as Ruben Amorim's top target to strengthen United's midfield.",
      "Romano told GIVEMESPORT: \"It means an important, very important, maybe crazy proposal is needed or Baleba is not available for sale this summer. It's never easy to negotiate with Brighton, especially with 23 days to go. But Manchester United wanted to try. Let's see what happens next.\"",
      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of young goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Derby County, according to CentreDevils.",
      "The report states that Hardy \"wasn't included in Derby County's scholarship list of 2025, with a move to the Reds getting closer now.\"",
      "The 15-year-old appeared for Derby's Under 18s four times last season and captained the side once against Leeds United.",
      "According to StrettyNews, Manchester United have lined up a new meeting with Gianluigi Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola this week. Confidence is growing at Old Trafford that Donnarumma, 26, is going to become their new first-choice goalkeeper in a summer move from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Talks for Donnarumma are led by Jason Wilcox, who wants to provide Amorim with a trusted pair of hands in goal, as Andre Onana has flattered to deceive since his move from Inter Milan.",
      "Roma are preparing a move for Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho, according to reports in Italy. The 25-year-old informed the Reds of his desire to explore different opportunities earlier this summer and it's claimed that the Serie A club want to bring him to Stadio Olimpico.",
      "Roma head coach Gian Piero Gasperini is said to be a huge fan of Sancho and is hoping to sign him, despite the fact he could take up a considerable amount of their transfer budget.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has accepted that his Manchester United career is all-but over following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig on Saturday, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Serie A side AC Milan are open to signing Hojlund, who impressed in Italy with Atalanta before his move to United in August 2023. The Dane was said to have rejected a move to RB Leipzig earlier in the summer but his stance has now changed and he has agreed to leave.",
      "United want around £30m for Hojlund but Milan are hoping to secure his signature on an initial loan deal.",
      "According to Marca, Manchester United are expected to submit an offer for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. Ruben Amorim's side are set to shift their attention to strengthening in midfield after signing Benjamin Sesko and Baleba has been identified as a top target.",
      "However, there is a stumbling block that United face. Brighton are an excellent selling club and do not intend to sell a player on the cheap, as seen with Moises Caicedo's £115million move to Chelsea.",
      "According to TBR Football, Manchester United are preparing to loan out Andre Onana and then attempt to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"We are told that Man United would consider allowing Onana to leave on a loan deal should they find a new number one between the sticks,\" the source said.",
      "\"Manchester United are open to making changes in their goalkeeping department and Onana is aware. There is a chance to bring in a Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martinez, one of the best keepers in the world, and United are tempted.",
      "\"However, understandably there is a lot of interest in Donnarumma – him being available is something more than just United think is a great opportunity.\"",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin has ditched his representative and will conduct his own transfer talks from now on as he tries to find a new club, according to The Sun.",
      "It's claimed that Calvert-Lewin, who left Everton when his contract expired earlier this summer, is keen to sign for Manchester United. The England international has his sights set on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sunderland and Aston Villa are among the others that remain interested in Calvert-Lewin, who found the net just three times in the Premier League last season.",

      "After finishing the 2023/24 Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference, Manchester United should have prioritised attacking signings in last summer's transfer window. Instead they added in three defenders, one defensive-midfielder and just one attacker.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt arrived from Bayern Munich and Leny Yoro checked in from Lille to strengthen United's defence before Manuel Ugarte arrived from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day to beef up the midfield.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, Joshua Zirkzee was signed from Bologna to challenge Rasmus Hojlund at the tip of the attack. Neither player will be in Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Arsenal this weekend.",
      "Although United should have prioritised the addition of a starting striker last summer, they instead added a holding midfielder. In their defence, there was plenty of logic behind that rationale.",
      "Throughout the 2023/24 campaign, United were regularly exposed in midfield. Opponents took full advantage of gaping holes in the centre of the pitch that opened up amid Casemiro's staggering decline from the season prior.",
      "Regardless of how impressive Casemiro was during the 2022/23 campaign, he was only ever going to offer a short-term fix. United needed younger legs in the engine room and they identified Ugarte as their top target, despite former manager Erik ten Hag ranking him third on his personal wish list.",
      "Ugarte arrived on deadline day and did not make his debut until the other side of the September international break.",
      "The season was already more than a month old by the time he eventually made his first Premier League start, alongside Kobbie Mainoo for the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 30.",
      "Although there is still an obvious need for United to sign a midfielder again this summer, strengthening that particular area of the pitch was not their main priority when the window opened on June 1. Instead, they prioritised the signing of a striker.",
      "After getting both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door in time for the pre-season tour of the United States, United added another attacker to their ranks on Saturday, landing the centre-forward they desperately needed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has arrived from RB Leipzig for an initial fee of £66.4million and has completed United's attacking rebuild. Signing a five-year-deal, the 22-year-old has moved to Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany last term.",
      "To have added Sesko to the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of the start of the season is a massive boost for United and Amorim, who must be feeling incredibly tempted to unleash his three new attackers as a trio for the first time against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, seeing Viktor Gyokeres go to Arsenal and running the rule over Ollie Watkins only to see Aston Villa make it crystal clear he was not for sale, there was a risk United's striker search could have still been ongoing in the closing stages of the window.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes Benjamin Sesko will benefit from the presence of fellow summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this season.",
      "United completed their attacking overhaul with the addition of the Slovenian international from RB Leipzig on Saturday. He has joined the club for an initial fee of £66.4million, signing a five-year deal.",
      "Sesko has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last season, meaning he will have ambitions of producing a similar return in his debut season in England. However, some doubts have been raised about United's decision to recruit a second young striker from abroad in three years.",
      "\"With those two [Cunha and Mbeumo], United have added two creative players, two very-attack minded players,\" Brown said, speaking on behalf of UK casinos. \"In the team, supporting him, that will really help.",
      "\"But I do think Sesko, in his own right, has had to sort of do that himself over the last two years. I know for a fact that clubs have been looking at him, and I think it is the right time that he went to a really, really big club.",
      "\"That is no disrespect to Leipzig, but he obviously wants to show what he can do on a bigger stage and I think now is the right time.",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is still there and he is the guy that did a lot last season. Amad will probably start at wing-back on the right-hand side and I think United have got a lot of players, that if they did get injuries, can come straight in and stick to the same routine.",
      "\"But United have these three individuals [Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko] that, respectfully for their own teams, have done really well over the last couple of years.\"",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United have brought in four few faces so far, spending the best part of £200m. Sesko has become the latest headline addition and Brown says the Reds have done a great job in the market thus far",
      "The former United defender added: \"It has been very positive. I think the players they have brought in have been excellent, to be honest.",
      "\"You get Cunha who is a presence and was probably the best attacking player in his team. He has got a bit about himself as well that United have missed over the years a little bit.",
      "\"Diego Leon is very promising, he looks strong, sharp and he knows his position. Then you get Mbeumo and Sesko and you are like, 'okay, this is good'.",
      "\"For me Mbeumo has been the best player for the last two years in the sense that what he has been able to continue doing through his club at the time. Sesko, I know a lot of teams have been looking at him for a good few years, so he has actually come with a lot of experience now, not just in leagues but in Europe as well.",
      "\"He is a big, tall lad, he knows how to play, he's good with his feet, can score with his head and you do have to say they have done a really good job.\"",

      "Manchester United have had a busy few days on the transfer front and look set to be handed another boost.",
      "United recently completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko on a permanent deal from RB Leipzig. The Reds beat Newcastle to the Slovenia international's signature, with Arsenal also interested in a deal earlier in the summer.",
      "Sesko has joined Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in completing a move to United this summer. That trio were unveiled as new United signings to the Old Trafford crowd ahead of their pre-season friendly against Fiorentina at the weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim could look to start Sesko as the first-choice centre forward for United for the season ahead. For United, they appear to have already been handed a financial boost after signing Sesko.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory have compiled the market value for many of the world's best and most promising footballers. Sesko is included among the most valuable players in the world, with a valuation of up to €124million (£107million).",
      "This is already significantly more than United have agreed to pay Leipzig in the deal for Sesko. United will pay an initial fee worth €76.5million (£66.2million) plus a further €8.5million (£7.4million) in add-ons.",
      "This means United will, in total, pay no more than approximately £74million. As a result, that is roughly £33million lower than what Sesko's market value currently is, with the potential for a significant increase if the striker meets his potential while at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko could make his debut for United on Sunday afternoon when they take on Arsenal in their Premier League opener. It remains to be seen if United will make any more signings before the start of the season.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's time at Manchester United is coming to an end - at least for this campaign - and perhaps even permanently should the Reds get their way in the next few days.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival from RB Leipzig was always going to leave question marks as to the future of the striker, considering he has been the first choice in that position since his arrival. Sadly, last campaign did little to prove to Ruben Amorim that the status quo in attacking quarters must remain.",
      "Should this deal - as is expected - be completed before the September 1 deadline, the Reds will be in a position where they need to replace the striker. While yes, United have just brought in a forward, they would be left with only Chido Obi or Joshua Zirkzee playing back-up to Sesko.",
      "While neither option is overly controversial, you feel that the Reds perhaps need more in the way of support for the Slovenian considering that Obi is still very raw and Zirkzee has enjoyed better performances in a deeper No.10 role. But, this is where there is a problem for the Reds.",
      "United's spending has been sky-high and even if they manage to sell Hojlund permanently, as well as Alejandro Garnacho for that matter, they will still need to be careful with the expenditure on what would essentially be a back-up. Fortunately, there is an option that would be available for free.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin may not be high on United fans' wish-list, but there is a lot to like about a deal for the ex-Everton man. First off, as mentioned he is available for free so the risk of bringing him to Old Trafford is minimal at best.",
      "Secondly, he seems eager to join. If reports are to be believed, he has \"sacked his agent\" in an attempt to take control of his future and work on a move to United.",
      "Third, he is a decent age. At 28, there is still a chance that the best of Calvert-Lewin is yet to come and Amorim would back himself to get the best possible performance out of him.",
      "Finally, he has an essential quality for a back-up which is Premier League experience. When at the top of his game, Calvert-Lewin has shown he has been able to deliver in the English top-flight which would make him an ideal 'Plan B' for Amorim moving forward.",
      "Of course, if we were talking about Calvert-Lewin being the main striker for United this season, alarm bells would be ringing. But, he would not be signed for that purpose and considering money for a Hojlund replacement will be tight, this seems like a hugely sensible option.",

      "Besiktas president Serdal Adali has insisted that his club - managed by Manchester United legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - want to sign Jadon Sancho this summer.",
      "Sancho has been in the wilderness at Old Trafford since September 2023, when he aired grievances with now-former manager Erik ten Hag on social media. From January 2024, he spent the second-half of the campaign at Borussia Dortmund before returning and joining Chelsea on loan on the summer deadline day last year.",
      "Chelsea had agreed a swoop which included an obligation to purchase the forward at the end of the campaign. However, an inability to reach an agreement on wages at the end of last season ensured the winger returned to United.",
      "The Blues paid a £5million penalty to United but the Reds have now been left with the task of seeking a new club for Sancho. The 25-year-old has already insisted that he wants to leave permanently this summer, but suitors have been hard to find.",
      "However, a saviour - in the form of a familiar face - could be to the rescue. Solskjaer moved to Besiktas in January and is currently in the midst of his first summer transfer window with the club.",
      "A forward is believed to be on his list of priorities and his club president was asked about the possibility of signing Sancho in a press conference on Monday. Responding, Adali said via NTVSpor: \"I want it as much as the club wants it. I've said this about other transfers as well.",
      "\"A player's decision to come to Turkey is crucial.",
      "\"We don't have the luxury of buying every player we want for a large sum. We have a budget, too.",
      "\"I want it more than our fans. We'll do everything we can to bring him here.",
      "\"It's important that the player wants to come to Turkey and Besiktas.",
      "\"We don't want to force anyone to come because of money.\"",
      "Sancho was one of Solskjaer's last signings at United when he arrived at the club in the summer of 2021. But, by November that same year, the Norwegian was gone after defeat to Watford at Vicarage Road.",

      "In the blink of an eye, pre-season has been and gone for Manchester United.",
      "They brought their pre-season schedule to a close with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday before winning on penalties to win the Snapdragon Cup.",
      "After producing performances in the US that were sharp and crisp, United were almost as lacklustre against Fiorentina as they were in their pre-season opener against Leeds three weeks earlier.",
      "The game was light on chances and United failed to impose themselves on their Italian visitors in the way head coach Ruben Amorim would have hoped. He must see a significant improvement against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Despite the underwhelming nature of United's overall performance, there were some positives in United's fifth and final warm up match of the summer, not least the combination play between Bryan Mbeumo and Amad down the right.",
      "After making his first appearance in United colours in the 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta, Mbeumo made a second consecutive start on Saturday, being deployed in the right-sided No.10 position.",
      "Amad, who was one of only two players to start all five of United's friendlies, was deployed at right wing-back and the duo linked up well in the first half.",
      "Despite only spending 45 minutes on the pitch together during the tour of the US, they offered plenty of signs to suggest they have already formed a strong understanding of each other's individual games.",
      "Sharing the same ambition of getting on the front foot, making runs into the penalty area and occupying attacking positions, the duo interchanged quite nicely until Mbeumo was sent up front for the second half.",
      "Regularly overlapping and underlapping each other, they offered signs of their understanding and mutual hunger to get United into promising positions. Both players are also left-footed, meaning they want to regularly come inside and make full use of their stronger foot.",
      "Mbeumo is having to adapt his game slightly from his Brentford days. He was regularly stationed on the right-wing at the Gtech Community Stadium, but he is playing a more inverted role at Old Trafford, though he will drift out wide from time to time depending on Amad's movements.",
      "Between them, Amad and Mbeumo scored 31 goals last season, meaning United will be expecting plenty of attacking output from their right flank this term. Amorim already has an \"idea\" in his mind about what his starting XI for the visit of Arsenal will look like and it is likely Amad and Mbeumo will be part of it.",
      "Amad was one of only two players who started every friendly, meaning he is a nailed on starter for the season curtain-raiser. He has adapted to Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system really well since the latter's appointment last November and is the only winger from the pool of wide men Amorim inherited that is still part of his plans.",
      "Both Amad and Mbeumo are interchangeable, capable of playing on the flank or as the right-sided No.10, meaning there is a high probability we will see Mbeumo out wide at some point and Amad operating closer to the penalty area. Amorim's approach could vary depending on the opposition.",
      "Although Mbeumo is still gaining match sharpness after just two appearances in pre-season, his first two outings in United colours have been promising.",
      "He will be an asset for the Reds this season and Amad is already showing signs of developing a rapport with him.",

      "Neil Wood has been praised by Fergie, trained alongside Roy Keane and fired by Gary Neville.",
      "He came through and coached at Manchester United's academy, played amid war-damaged buildings in Bosnia and is now splitting coaching duties between Trinidad and Tobago's men's team and Canada Women's national team.",
      "You won't find many folk with more United connections than Wood. He spent more than two decades at Old Trafford all told before leaving his role as Under-23 manager - where he played a part in the development of Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Anthony Elanga to name a few - to become Salford City boss under the ownership of Gary Neville, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.",
      "He was axed by his United alumni after just 18 months in charge, a decision that Wood still feels was harsh given Gary Neville and Giggs sent on messages following his dismissal citing how impressive the football style and training sessions were.",
      "\"It is a results business but I am pretty sure if I had stayed we would have been fine. For me, it needed a bit of patience.",
      "\"The first season was really successful. The owners asked me to create a playing style, bring the culture of the club together and improve the players and the team, which is exactly what I did. We got to the play off semi-final against Stockport (losing on penalties).",
      "\"I had spent a year building a playing style and in the second year I wanted to build on it. But some players were brought in that didn't fit the style.",
      "\"At the time (Gary) Neville was CEO but then he stepped back and Nicky Butt took over and then Ryan Giggs came in as sporting director. They were always around, and in a supportive way. But they all see the game differently, there were all different types of players so it is only normal to like different things in different players. That was the challenge. Sometimes you were stuck in the middle.\"",
      "Wood has since taken on roles with Canada's women's team - working alongside former Manchester United Women boss Casey Stoney - and Trinidad and Tobago's men's team, where Dwight Yorke is the head coach.",
      "Those two jobs mean the passport is seeing plenty of action as he potentially gears up for a men's World Cup next summer, a women's World Cup the year after and then the 2028 Olympics.",
      "\"It has been a new challenge and a new environment which I have really enjoyed,\" says Wood of his unusual job split.",
      "\"I am experiencing different tournaments, the preparation and delivery, not having a lot of time with the players, players coming in from different countries, all from different levels, all playing different ways at their clubs. There is always adaptability and trying to get the best out of the players you have got and try and improve them individually and improve the team.",
      "\"I feel like I have experienced a lot and that is part of the reason I have taken on these new roles. I’m always thinking, 'What can I learn? What is different?' I have the experience of coming through at United as a player of suffering bad injuries, and then into coaching.\"",
      "It was at United as a promising midfielder that Wood's football career began. He was a local lad, playing for his boyhood club and impressing as a talented teenager. He was training with the first team at 17 and mixing with the likes of Roy Keane and Juan Sebastian Veron before injuries halted his progress.",
      "\"I left school in July and went into pre-season and by Christmas I was training with the first team,\" he recalls. \"I was training with the first team every day at 16/17 and the speed and level was incredible. Then I had some injuries which just set me back a couple of years and by that time people had overtaken me a bit and it was difficult to get back.\"",
      "Instead, Wood spent time out on loan before leaving permanently for Coventry. But his spell there and subsequent time at Blackpool and Oldham saw regular injuries and limited playing time.",
      "It resulted in a move to Sarajevo to join Željezničar, a switch that rekindled Wood's love of the game and set him on his coaching path.",
      "\"I ended up going to Sarajevo,\" explains Wood. \"I did a year there but it was the first club since leaving United where I got coached. We had a Serbian manager who had worked for a long time with Javier Clemente, the old Spain coach. He worked off the Spanish model and it wasn't 4-4-2, it was quite tactical, there was video analysis, he would sit down with you and try to improve you.",
      "\"That was a massive learning curve for me and I was really glad that I did it, it opened my eyes to different ways. Sometimes I would play centre midfield, sometimes I was left wing back and all of a sudden I was getting the ball in space and the penny was dropping on the different ways to play football.",
      "\"That is what ignited my road to coaching. I stopped playing in England because I stopped enjoying it, injuries didn't help with my knees, but when I went into coaching I always tried to implement something different to the traditional English style.",
      "\"Zeljeznicar was the working class club of the city, they had a group of fans called 'the Maniacs' who used to go everywhere.",
      "\"I lived where I could walk to the stadium. You could see the high rises where it had been shelled from the war, but the people were so friendly and it was a great city.\"",
      "Wood returned to England and started on a path in coaching, initially working for free at Aston Villa with age-group sides before United came calling and he began to work with a talented crop of kids who would go on to become household names.",
      "\"When I first went back I was doing the Under-14s,\" he said. \"Elanga was Under-13s, Angel Gomes was there, Rashford was in the 16s. I followed the age groups up to 23s almost with the same group of players.",
      "\"Anthony (Elanga) going to Newcastle is a great move for him, Alvaro (Fernandez) going to Real Madrid is amazing for him and his family.\"",
      "Wood worked with Amad when he first moved to Old Trafford, along with Garnacho, while he gave Shola Shoretire and Kobbie Mainoo their first taste of European football in the Youth League.",
      "\"When Amad first came, we didn't know too much about him and he had a big price tag,\" recalls Wood. \"He would train with the first team but play with the 23s. Leading up to games he would train with us and straight away you could see his talent.",
      "\"He was quiet, learning the language, and it is not easy. The lads loved playing with him, he was intelligent and smart. He just needed a bit of time, did really well at Sunderland and when he came back you were just waiting for him to get his chance and when he did, he took it.\"",
      "Amad's future at United is bright, for Garnacho this summer looks like the end of the road for him at Old Trafford, something Wood feels is a shame.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" surmises Wood. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "And with that our conversation concludes. Wood's next test comes in the form of Trinidad and Tobago's World Cup qualifying campaign next month. A journey that started at The Cliff will next take in Curaçao. The passport will be ready.",

      "Everyone at Old Trafford was delighted to see Benjamin Sesko unveiled before the Fiorentina friendly - everyone except Rasmus Hojlund, who started the final pre-season friendly of the summer on the bench.",
      "Manchester United introduced Sesko alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon, with the loudest cheer reserved for Sesko after his £66.4million arrival from RB Leipzig.",
      "The official announcement of Sesko's transfer came on the morning of the game. Sesko arrived in Manchester on a private jet on Thursday evening and completed his medical the following day. United deserve huge credit for wrapping up the deal in a no-nonsense fashion, despite competition from Newcastle.",
      "Sesko has been signed to help sharpen United's attack. United scored a measly 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Sesko scored almost 50 per cent of that total (21 goals) in all competitions.",
      "Hojlund contributed just four league goals in 2024/25. The Denmark international was overlooked for Mason Mount against Fiorentina, which felt like another nail in the coffin for his United career.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Hojlund during the United States tour and his performances were better. However, Amorim sent a message by starting Mount as the false nine and naming Hojlund on the bench against Fiorentina.",
      "Hojlund's prospects of another season in Manchester don't look good when he isn't chosen to start when Sesko isn't in the squad, and he is overlooked for a midfielder in his position.",
      "Mount worked hard, but he did not provide a focal point at the tip of the attack and Hojlund probably would have done a better job, which suggests Amorim does not have him in his plans.",
      "Amorim even rejigged his front line for the second half, moving Mbeumo from the right into the middle. Hojlund was overlooked for the second time and ended the game as an unused substitute.",
      "The 22-year-old won't have watched Sesko's unveiling with a smile on his face because the arrival of the Slovenia international is expected to lead to his departure from the club.",
      "In different chats with journalists throughout the summer, Hojlund has reiterated he wants to stay and fight for his place, but the decision could be taken out of his hands. United are prepared to listen to offers in the region of £30m for Hojlund and a loan offer could also be considered.",
      "It wouldn't have been easy for Hojlund to watch Sesko being paraded at Old Trafford, the signing who could bring an end to his time in Manchester.",
      "Hojlund regressed spectacularly last season. He was certainly not the only underperformer, but his regression was stark and contributed to United's biggest problem: their lack of goals.",
      "It was also interesting to hear Amorim speak about Sesko before kick-off. \"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" he told MUTV. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "Amorim's selection against Fiorentina showed he does not believe Hojlund has the \"characteristics\" that United need. Hojlund had last season to convince Amorim and his audition was unsuccessful.",
      "However, it is slightly ironic that Sesko has a similar profile to Hojlund. They are the same age and Sesko is unproven in the Premier League, so his signing does come with a degree of risk.",
      "United need Sesko to achieve much more than Hojlund has during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with Fiorentina before winning a penalty shootout in their final pre-season outing on Saturday.",
      "United unveiled their four summer signings and paid tribute to David de Gea ahead of kick off, but the visitors were keen to spoil the party and they went ahead early on through Simon Sohm. United soon hit back from a corner as Robin Gosens put through his own net under pressure from Leny Yoro and Casemiro.",
      "Matheus Cunha went close with a drilled effort in the second half and Fiorentina hit the bar, but neither side could find a winner as the game ended 1-1.",
      "A penalty shootout followed the 90 minutes which United won 5-4.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",

      "Had no chance for the goal and had little else to do. Saved a penalty in the shootout to help United retain the Snapdragon Cup. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Lined up for the fourth game running and helped force the equaliser from Gosens' own goal. A solid end to an encouraging pre-season. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "A leggy start but settled after United stopped playing walking football. Had a shot at goal repelled by De Gea. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Looked like he hadn't started in two weeks and too casual at times. Went down injured in the second half and had to go off. 6",
      "Amad",
      "One of two players who have started all five friendlies. Linked up promisingly with Bryan Mbeumo again down the right. Panenka'd his penalty. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Plodded around for much of the contest to serve as a reminder of how much of a minefield United's midfield is. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "United fans chanted his name before a kick, they're that pleased he's staying. Demanding of teammates, as ever, and proactive from a deeper role. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Failed to maintain his tour form on a sheepish return to Old Trafford as most of United's attacking play came down the opposite side. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Another enterprising performance as he played for an hour after getting 45 minutes in Atlanta. A threatening presence before he was moved up front. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Returned to his favoured role on the left of the front three but on the fringes for the majority on a frustrating afternoon. Shot wide in the second half. Came close to scoring a winner. Nonchalantly converted a penalty. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Oddly started up front when he has struggled to do much in roles he is familiar with at United. Moved back to one of the 10s in the second half. Linked up well to create a chance for Cunha. 5",
      "Subs",
      "Diogo Dalot",

      "Last season, season ticket holders behind the dugouts in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand were informed their seats would be converted into premium hospitality seats, which meant they would be relocated.",
      "Around 500 supporters were affected and the club received intense backlash. Some of the fans who were forced to move have platinum season tickets (25+ years) and felt their loyalty meant nothing.",
      "The decision triggered protests from the affected fans, who aimed banners at the directors' box.",
      "Despite the controversy, the changes to convert the area into premium seating were made this summer and they were seen for the first time before the Fiorentina friendly on Saturday.",
      "The seats are near the pitch and offer easy access in and out of the stadium. They also offer a close view of Ruben Amorim on the touchline and the players on the bench are almost within touching distance.",
      "Defending their decision, United previously explained it was made to 'reflect the high value of this unique location.' They also claimed that they: \"Appreciate the disruption this will cause those fans who currently sit there and we will be contacting them individually to ensure a suitable alternative seat is found.\"",
      "In March, one season ticket holder of 40 years, who had tickets with his family and didn't wish to be named while in the process of being moved, said: \"The people who are in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand are the people who've been season ticket holders and supporting the club the longest.",
      "\"There's been several clips on social media about people talking about having had those season tickets for over 50 years. I’ve had mine for 40. So you're attacking the people who've supported the club through some very thin times over the years, and they're the people who will continue to bring in the next generation of support.",
      "\"With a flimsy email, with no consultation or discussion, tell them you're off and at the moment we can't actually tell you where you're going is really bad. We've had contact with a number of people who are thinking if that's the way it is, I think the love affair’s over, unfortunately.\"",

      "But there will be eyes on the Portuguese's team as their new attacking trio will be looking to make an immediate impact. Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha were all unveiled in front of their new supporters prior to their 1-1 draw with Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly.",
      "Following last season's dour showing, there is pressure on United to bounce back and push up the table to reclaim their place in Europe.",
      "The MEN has taken a look at the latest Man United rumours...",
      "Former defender Mikael Silvestre has warned Manchester United against offloading Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane faces question marks over his future at Old Trafford following the blockbuster arrival of Sesko.",
      "Hojlund could be left in the cold during an important season for club and country with Denmark looking to book their place in next summer's World Cup.",
      "Sesko's big-money move saw Amorim acquire his desired forward but it has sparked speculation over Hojlund's future in Manchester. Silvestre, though. says keeping the striker among the options would be beneficial.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has gone and there are not a lot of strikers around, Joshua Zirkzee is a different type of striker that doesn’t make those runs in behind the defence,\" the former central defender said.",
      "\"He is another type of player for certain games, certain opposition.",
      "\"But no, you need competition, need quality, so I wouldn’t rush into sending Rasmus Hojlund out on loan if Sesko signs. Absolutely not.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: It's an interesting point that Silvestre makes, with Joshua Zirkzee offering a different expertise in the attacking positions, what harm would it do for Amorim's options? The only problem would be Hojlund's desire to play first-team football and the amount of interest in his services.",
      "Caught Offside have claimed that Newcastle United are considering a move for Carlos Baleba. It has been said the Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder is a player of interest to recruitment figures at Old Trafford.",
      "The MEN reported this week that Toby Coller would not be considered as a makeweight in a swap deal for the highly-rated Cameroon international.",
      "Reports suggest that Newcastle are in a 'observation phase' over a move for Baleba, who is valued around £100 million by the Seagulls.",
      "MEN Sport says: Carlos Baleba would be a phenomenal signing for United and it is no surprise to see clubs beginning to get in line for his signature. A move for the 24-year-old would be a catalyst in transforming Amorim's engine room but a deal for Newcastle, at this time, seems unlikely. The Magpies have already been disappointed in the transfer window by losing out on their attacking targets, Sesko being a recent example, so a big-money move for Baleba doesn't quite make sense.",

      "The Reds' new centre-forward flew to Manchester on Thursday evening and completed his medical and final pieces of paperwork, on Friday. Saturday morning, United announced their new acquisition from RB Leipzig with £74m splashed on the Slovenian.",
      "His arrival brings to an end long-term interest in Sesko that began three years ago while the centre-forward was featuring for RB Salzburg. The 22-year-old was not purchased in time to feature against the Italian club but was unveiled to fans before kick-off at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "With Sesko absent, Ruben Amorim chose to play Mount in a false nine position which did not work to great affect. Speaking after the match to MUTV, Amorim admitted: \"We struggled without a reference as a striker.",
      "\"We have a new player [Sesko], so we'll see.\" Following the draw and eventual penalty shootout victory over the Florence club, Mount took to social media to welcome Sesko to his new home.",

      "That decision will perhaps rest on how Sesko performs in training this week in the lead-up to the season opener on Sunday, August 17. One player who could start is Rasmus Hojlund.",

      "Concerns were initially raised last month when a photo showing concourse prices from Soccer Aid circulated on social media. United said prices were still undecided, but they have now confirmed a hike for beer.",
      "Fans who attended the Fiorentina friendly on Saturday were stung by increased costs, with the price of bottle of Carling (500ml) increasing by 30 per cent and a pint of Madri increasing by 51 per cent.",
      "Supporters have already complained about the price increases, and more fans will be affected when Old Trafford is at full capacity for the opening Premier League game of the season.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this has coincided with high increases in food & beverage (25-30%) in the last three years since kiosk prices were last reviewed holistically.",
      "\"To reflect the increase in operating costs, and the rising cost of produce, for the 2025/26 campaign we will not be able to continue offering this discount and therefore some kiosk prices will increase.",
      "\"Most notably, bottled Carling (500ml) will increase from £3.80 to £4.95 (which remains cheaper than 3 years ago), and a pint of Madri will increase from £3.80 to £5.75.",
      "\"Although this is an increase on previous seasons, it still means a pint of beer is beneath the £6 average in the Premier League, and well beneath the average cost of a pint of beer at five local pubs to Old Trafford used by fans on match day (£6.29).",
      "\"Based on prices known publicly, the revised pricing means Old Trafford will serve the 9th cheapest pint in the Premier League.",
      "\"Meal deals remain available, and fans can pick up three items for £10.70 (£1 increase on 2024/25) and six items for £20 (£2.80 increase on 2024/25) offering good value for money (meal deals include 1 hot food item, typically grill-type e.g. pie or hot dog, 1 drink e.g. beer, wine, or soft drink, 1 snack e.g. chips/crisps or confectionery).\"",
      "Over the last few years, local Mancunians have argued they are being priced out of attending matches at Old Trafford, and United received intense backlash over ticket prices last term.",

Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.’",

      "Man City are shifting Jack Grealish and could sell Savinho, which probably wasn’t part of the plan. Have they got something big up their sleeve? And could Manchester United hijack Liverpool’s move for Marc Guehi?",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nAll signs point to this being utter horse sh*t, but with these two clubs, you never quite know. Chelsea would sell if the deal was right because business, and City have form for doing daft things. But surely even they wouldn’t do a £200million-plus-£50million for a player they sold for £40million two years ago.",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly left the door ajar for Donnarumma’s departure, and it’s now swung open after he was left out of PSG’s squad for the Super Cup on Wednesday. Big Fab now claims he will ‘100% leave’ while ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "",
      "18) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nWith Grealish gone and interest in Savinho, we could see this happening. And it’s great news for Real, with City, Liverpool and Arsenal threatening a bidding war that didn’t look likely at the start of the summer.",
      "",

      "",
      "17) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "15) Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",
      "",
      "14) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation. Nantes’ Matthis Abline is being eyed as a possible replacement should Newcastle come for Larsen.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against Palace in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked, and would prefer a loan with an option. Which does United little to no good.",
      "",
      "11) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt is pushing a fortnight sine Liverpool’s first bid for Isak was very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east, and Newcastle have reportedly told their ‘furious’ star that he’s not leaving. But we doubt this is dead yet.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. It seems they need to sell before they really get into it with Palace, who have always been clear that they expect the £68million necessary to buy Eze out of his contract.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more and that seems to be the sticking point. Lots of talk of agreements between Chelsea and the player, but United won’t give him away. Yet.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nWe have a Newcastle ‘Here we go’, and a player who ‘only wanted’ them. The end is nigh, folks. Thiaw is in Tyneside for a medical.",

      "The Italy international joined PSG from AC Milan in 2021 on a free transfer and has made 161 appearances for the Ligue 1 giants, recently starring for them to claim their first Champions League title, keeping six clean sheets across the competition, including one in the final.",
      "But he’s been heavily linked with an exit this summer having rejected PSG’s offers of a new contract, based in the new salary structure of lower wages with big incentives on performances.",
      "A report over the weekend claimed Donnarumma has been left to ‘find a new club’ as PSG ‘do not want to keep the Italy international and have two top keepers in the squad this season having signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille for £47m this summer.",
      "It was also noted that they ‘expect an offer from Chelsea, Manchester United or Inter Milan, who have all had contact with Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma’s agent’.",
      "TalkSPORT reporter Anil Kandola later claimed he’s been informed that Donnarumma ‘wants’ Man Utd and ‘United get him if they want him’ before a report on Monday claimed the Red Devils have ‘held direct meetings’ for Donnarumma, with manager Ruben Amorim a ‘big fan’ of the 26-year-old.",
      "And now transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has offered United and the other interested clubs a big boost by revealing Donnarumma will ‘100% leave the club’, though not necessarily this summer, with the ‘relationship completely broken’ after he was left out of their squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Paris Saint-Germain exclude Gigio Donnarumma from their squad for UEFA Super Cup. Donnarumma will not sign new deal at PSG, there’s no agreement and he will 100% leave the club, this summer or in 2026 as free agent. Gigio’s camp feel it’s unfair situation for the GK.’",
      "He later added: ‘Gigio Donnarumma will leave Paris St Germain for sure, most likely this or eventually next summer. The relationship is completely broken after club decide to exclude Gigio from their squad for Super Cup. Understand Premier League is the most likely destination.’",
      "Donnarumma is currently valued by Transfermarkt at €40m [£35m] but The Sun claim PSG are willing to listen to offers of just £26m for the goalkeeper.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United have the funds to sign Donnarumma without selling members of their bomb squad, though they’ve remarkably managed to secure the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon for a combined £198m despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s insistence that they would have been “bust by Christmas” had he not saved their bacon, so what’s an extra £26m?",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘direct meetings’ for the signing of a Champions League-winning star who’s been told to find a new club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United and Chelsea have ‘made contact’ over signing Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed two signings he would ‘love’ after Manchester United land Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Man Utd still “really want” to complete a deal to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa but a deal for Gianluigi Donnarumma has been ruled out.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth about rumours that Man Utd could sign Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Man Utd are ‘in talks’ with Paris Saint-Germain to complete a stunning summer signing, with the transfer very much ‘ON’."

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘direct meetings’ for the signing of a Champions League-winning star who’s been told to find a new club.",
      "United have done a good job improving their forward line this summer. Last term, no Red Devil surpassed 10 Premier League goals, and only Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo got to eight.",
      "As a result, three new attackers have been signed: Matheus Cunha, Bryam Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. They scored 17, 20 and 21 goals respectively last term, and should be a huge help to United’s attack.",
      "But other areas of the pitch are in need of a touch-up following a 15th-placed Premier League finish. Andre Onana made three errors leading to goals in the league last season, and United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Amid the revelation that Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been told to find a new club – despite keeping six clean sheets in his club’s triumphant Champions League campaign last season, including one in the final – United have been looking at him.",
      "Now, Centre Devils reports the club have ‘held direct meetings’ for Donnarumma. Ruben Amorim is said to be a ‘big fan’ of the Italian goalkeeper, and is therefore considering him as United’s next No.1.",
      "That builds on reports which detailed why Donnarumma looks likely to be leaving PSG. It is suggested that the French club expect offers from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, who have all collected information from the goalkeeper’s agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "It was also said that with one year left on his deal in Paris, Donnarumma wanted to extend his deal, but could not come to an agreement with his club.",
      "Already one of the highest earners at the club, the Italian is said to have wanted a pay rise, and refused to accept the new salary structure of lower wages with big incentives on performances.",
      "Whether United would be able to give the Champions League winner the type of contract he wants, and probably deserves after his performances last season, remains to be seen.",
      "They have spent a lot of money on transfers this summer and thus far have not recouped any of it in sales. Wantaways Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are all yet to be sold, so that could bring in some cash.",
      "But whether that goes towards the signing of Donnarumma remains to be seen.",
      "The top Man Utd target ‘will 100% leave’ and Fabrizio Romano has revealed his ‘most likely destination’ in a cut-price transfer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United and Chelsea have ‘made contact’ over signing Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.",

      "Eddie Howe is pretty high in the betting, with only three Premier League managers deemed less safe.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "18=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might if a new-look City make a stumbling start and he decides to sod it all for a game of soldiers.",
      "",
      "15=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "15=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "9) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nAnother really interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four points adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we’ve said elsewhere, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "4=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "4=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "1) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "La Liga giants Real Madrid are planning an ‘early offer’ to sign youngster Max Dowman from Premier League side Arsenal, according to reports.",
      "Valencia have reportedly viewed a comment by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta as a ‘threat’ following the sale of Cristhian Mosquera to the Premier League club.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "The idea that Mikel Arteta must either win the Premier League title this season or be sacked by Arsenal next summer is flawed for a number of reasons."

      "Dominic Solanke’s injury is apparently minor enough that we can just about look past the fact Richarlison is starting up front for Spurs in big 2025.",
      "Richarlison will be moved on if Spurs get the rest of the window anything other than catastrophically wrong, so expect to see him play 35 Premier League games this season.",

      "But he is not, and we suspect never will be, a creative No. 10. There are worse midfield threes than him, Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha for sure, but there aren’t many less progressive ones.",
      "In the absence of anyone notably prolific within the front three, it’s going to be a long and dreary season watching Spurs bash their head against brick wall after brick wall if they don’t come up with some kind of solution to the long-term absence of both James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski.",

      "And if Arne Slot was minded to do something about that it would be a thought instantly cast from his mind by a glance along a substitutes’ bench that revealed Endo as the closest thing available to another centre-back.",
      "Liverpool have spent giant wads of cash making their title-winning team even better, with the current conspicuous exception of centre-back where Jarell Quansah’s sale is the only significant change.",
      "They appear to be relying on at least one of Konate and Joe Gomez being available at all times, which doesn’t have a vast amount of historical data to support it. And even then it relies on the notion that a 34-year-old Van Dijk can simply be asked to play all of the football all of the time to a consistently excellent standard.",
      "It’s been noted elsewhere, but Marc Guehi having such a fine game against Liverpool’s sparkling array of attacking options in a game where Palace frequently exposed Liverpool’s under-stocked defence might not actually prove to be good news for Palace in the longer term.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Anthony Gordon as centre-forward\nIt has not been a fun summer for Newcastle, with the worst part of a 2-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the coveted Sela Cup not even the fact they had little choice but to start with Anthony Gordon up front, but the sight of him hobbling off in the closing stages.",
      "So now, among everything else they’ve got to contend with, they’ve gone from the frying pan of ‘Anthony Gordon is our starting centre-forward’ to the fire of ‘We must desperately hope Anthony Gordon is fit enough to be our starting centre-forward’.",

With all due respect, Jamaal Lascelles captaining Newcastle in 2025 would have been some way down the list of post-takeover ambitions,",
      "Nevertheless, because we are sickos, we do want to see precisely what happens should Newcastle find themselves having to play an entire season with an attack made up of assorted flavour of tricky winger. Gordon, Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga has the look of an enormously fun, if not particularly effective, attacking trio, one where they’re all either constantly far too far apart or treading on each other’s toes and where Newcastle go from Isak’s elite goalscoring to finishing this season with Joelinton (9) as their top league goalscorer.",

We do at least know United have taken steps to remedy that with the arrival of the big-jumping and occasional goal-scoring Benjamin Sesko, a man who definitely won’t be the latest not-quite-elite striker to be chewed up and spat out by the sheer ridiculousness of this particular Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Robert Sanchez as goalkeeper\nIt’s now a new thing, it’s not even just a pre-season thing. But however much we may come to rationalise the idea that Chelsea’s insane transfer policy might in fact be perfectly suited to football’s insane world, we will never, ever allow it to become normalised that here lies a football club willing to spend half-a-billion pounds a year putting elite players on eight-year contracts yet continuing to entrust a really very important job indeed to a man who couldn’t keep Jason Steele out of the Brighton team.",
      "Chelsea have loads of goalkeepers, because Chelsea have loads of footballers. It’s what they do. But how are we still in a situation where every single one of those many, many goalkeepers sits somewhere between ‘sh*tbone awful’ and ‘meh’ on the tried-and-tested goalkeeper-quality rating scale?",
      "Of all the things we don’t really understand or even pretend to understand about how Chelsea’s transfer policy works, this is the thing we don’t understand the most. Especially now they have actual strikers."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st – £53.1m",
      "2nd – £50.4m",
      "3rd – £47.7m",
      "4th – £45m",
      "5th – £42.4m",
      "6th – £39.8m",
      "7th – £37.1m",
      "8th – £34.5m",
      "9th – £31.9m",
      "10th – £29.1m",
      "11th – £26.5m",
      "12th – £23.8m",
      "13th – £21.2m",
      "14th – £18.6m",
      "15th – £15.9m",
      "16th – £13.3m",
      "17th – £10.7m",
      "18th – £7.9m",
      "19th – £5.2m",
      "20th – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Another forward could also be pushed out as a result of the signing of Sesko, as multiple reports have suggested that addition has meant there’s no space for Rasmus Hojlund anymore.",
      "Speaking about the signing of the RB Leipzig striker, United legend Silvestre warned Ruben Amorim and the Red Devils board that should not mean Hojlund is sold.",
      "He said: “Marcus Rashford has gone and there are not a lot of strikers around, Joshua Zirkzee is a different type of striker that doesn’t make those runs in behind the defence.",
      "“He is another type of player for certain games, certain opposition. But no, you need competition, need quality, so I wouldn’t rush into sending Rasmus Hojlund out on loan. Absolutely not.”",
      "There is a chance that it’s not just a loan deal that Hojlund leaves on, as reports have suggested United would actually prefer to sell him, while the Denmark international is now ‘reluctantly ready to leave’.",
      "Transfer insider Ben Jacobs has said: ‘Rasmus Hojlund has now been directly told he’ll need to leave to gain minutes this season and is considering his options. Manchester United prefer to sell, but have not ruled out a loan. Milan prepared to meet #MUFC’s £40m valuation via a loan fee and buy option. Further talks took place yesterday.’",
      "As a result of United telling Hojlund to leave, though some don’t think he should, it is suggested he has accepted that might be best.",
      "Indeed, it’s been stated he is reluctantly ready to leave – despite recently suggesting he is hopeful that he can stay and fight for his place at just 22 years old – and sources are accepting that Sesko’s arrival means the Dane’s days are numbered.",
      "After he scored just four Premier League goals in 32 games last season, it’s not a surprise that United have both signed a new striker, and will prioritise him and Zirkzee, who was signed after Hojlund and still has the faith of the coaches despite a lean first season.",
      "Manchester United are ‘close to a total agreement’ with AC Milan for the 22-year-old, who’s set for ‘direct talks’ with Old Trafford chiefs on Tuesday.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Man Utd career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports."

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has reportedly ‘verbally asked’ his club to let him join Manchester United, while his agent has agreed to United’s proposal on personal terms.",
      "United’s focus was always reportedly likely to switch to the midfield once they had fixed their striker problems. They had gotten Matheus Cunha early in the window for a wide role, and added Bryan Mbeumo to the other side not long after.",
      "It took them longer to secure a striker, but they did so but signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, beating Premier League rivals Newcastle to the transfer.",
      "While that was still ongoing, interest in Brighton’s Baleba was revealed, and the player himself seems to be angling for a move.",
      "According to insider X account indykaila, not only does the midfielder want out of Brighton, but he has ‘verbally asked’ them to let him move to United.",
      "His agent is also said to have ‘given the thumbs up’ on the offer of personal terms at Old Trafford if the Seagulls allow the midfielder to leave.",
      "It is said that Brighton will not budge from their £100million valuation, so that’s what United have to reach if they’re going to have any chance of signing Baleba.",
      "Whether they’ll be able to do that after spending around £200million on players already is a big question. There are still the potential exits of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia to bring in some money.",
      "Whether they would raise the funds needed to sign Baleba remains to be seen.",
      "But if the midfielder is not sold by Brighton in this window, it seems his value will continue to rise. While reports have placed the midfielder at the £100million mark, insider David Ornstein has suggested United haven’t been told that, but Brighton expect Baleba’s price to climb.",
      "He said: ‘Brighton’s preference is to keep Carlos Baleba until at least summer 2026. Manchester United have made an enquiry via intermediaries and were not quoted a price. The Brighton hierarchy believe Baleba can be worth as much as Moises Caicedo one day, who the club sold to #CFC for £115m.’",
      "The Seagulls have always known when they are able to demand a top price for their stars, with Caicedo the most famous example, alongside others such as Alexis Mac Allister, who with add-ons was said to potentially reach £55million, Marc Cucurella, who cost Chelsea £56million, and Robert Sanchez, who cost the Blues £25million.",
      "Manchester United are set for ‘new talks’ over a move for the midfielder, who they believe is ‘keen’ on the move to Old Trafford this summer, according Romano.",
      "Man Utd have seen an opening part-exchange offer for Carlos Baleba ‘rejected’ by Brighton, who are now ‘planning for his departure’.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have joined Manchester United in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League giants Brighton.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed two signings he would ‘love’ after Manchester United land Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Man Utd will have to look elsewhere this summer after Brighton made it clear that Carlos Baleba is not for sale, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund has now ‘reluctantly’ accepted that he will have to leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m earlier this week to complete a new attacking trident with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also joining earlier this summer.",
      "Man Utd have now addressed their lack of attacking capabilities from last season with only four Premier League sides scoring fewer goals than Ruben Amorim’s side as they finished 15th.",
      "Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee came in for lots of criticism with the duo scoring just seven Premier League goals between them last term.",
      "And now Hojlund looks likely to be the man to leave as Man Utd look to recoup funds after bringing in Sesko for big money with AC Milan reportedly interested.",
      "Before Sesko signed, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano hinted that Hojlund could be the man to leave if the striker signed from RB Leipzig.",
      "READ: Seven ways Manchester United have ‘huge advantage’ in title race revealed with Isak threat to fail",
      "Romano said last week: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "While Hojlund was publicly clear that he wanted to stay, he told reporters last week: “I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Now it’s just about for me to sharpen myself and I’ve done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp, so I’m welcoming everything that comes. I think it’s good with competition and it only sharpens the team.”",
      "But now transfer journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed that Hojlund has been ‘told he’ll need to leave’ if he wants to play minutes this season as Man Utd look to sell him.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: ‘Rasmus Hojlund has now been directly told he’ll need to leave to gain minutes this season and is considering his options. Manchester United prefer to sell, but have not ruled out a loan. Milan prepared to meet #MUFC’s £40m valuation via a loan fee and buy option. Further talks took place yesterday.’",
      "Before he and Alex Crook added more on talkSPORT with Hojlund ‘reluctantly ready to leave’ Man Utd and that ‘sources close to Hojlund accept the Dane’s days at Old Trafford are numbered following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko’.",
      "Manchester United are ‘close to a total agreement’ with AC Milan for the 22-year-old, who’s set for ‘direct talks’ with Old Trafford chiefs on Tuesday.",
      "Manchester United legend Mikael Silvestre has warned the club there are “not a lot” of the type of player they are willing to let go of around, and they should ...",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s Man Utd career appears to be on borrowed time after he was sent a ‘clear message’ from Ruben Amorim, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports."

      "The Red Devils have spent a lot of money on a new attacking trident in the form of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko, with the latter joining earlier this week.",
      "Sesko arrived from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m, while Cunha joined from Wolves for £62.5m and Mbeumo signed from Brentford in a £65m transfer.",
      "The huge investment in the trio is a reaction to a season in which only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd as Ruben Amorim’s side finished 15th.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer, with AC Milan reportedly interested, and now Man Utd could add Calvert-Lewin as back up.",
      "Ben Jacobs revealed interest from Newcastle in Calvert-Lewin last month, he wrote on X: ‘Newcastle retain an interest in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but are reticent to meet his terms. Nothing is advanced currently, nor has a new offer been presented to Calvert-Lewin so far. #NUFC are still assessing several options after missing out on Joao Pedro, and learning Callum Wilson would not extend.",
      "READ: Seven ways Manchester United have ‘huge advantage’ in title race revealed with Isak threat to fail",
      "‘A move will only progress if Calvert-Lewin reduces his terms from 12 months ago when #NUFC made a concrete offer. And even then, Newcastle are somewhat wary of Calvert-Lewin’s injury record.’",
      "Around the same time in early July, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Man Utd interest in Calvert-Lewin, he said: “What happened with Calvert-Lewin is that the player has been offered to Manchester United.",
      "“It’s not that Man United started negotiations for Calvert-Lewin as new striker. The player has been offered as an opportunity on a free transfer, a cheap opportunity for a player who has experience, knows the league and can be helpful for any club.",
      "“So Man United registered the eventual cost of the deal. It means, obviously, the salary, the commission, the intention of the player, who would be, obviously, very open and excited to join Manchester United eventually in this summer transfer window.",
      "“But at the moment, it’s not yet a concrete negotiation.”",
      "While there were other reports around the same time claiming that Man Utd had pulled out of a deal for the former Everton striker over a ‘major red flag’.",
      "It was understood at the time that ‘any potential deal is off as influential figures stopped short of engaging in prolonged discussions due to identifying his injury record as a major red flag when going in search of fresh firepower’.",
      "But now Caught Offside claim Man Utd are considering the England international ‘as back-up option’ ‘exploring the possibility of adding Calvert-Lewin to Ruben Amorim’s squad as a depth option in attack’.",
      "The website insist Newcastle could still be an option and add on Man Utd interest: ‘The new United boss is keen on having a strong rotational setup, viewing the former Everton man as a capable third or fourth-choice striker who could provide valuable cover across a long season.’",
      "Man Utd look set to beat Newcastle to another striker after Ruben Amorim’s side won the race for Benjamin Sesko last week.",

      "A large amount of rotation will also be in place with the goal of having a reasonably fresh 16 for the Champions league final date in Budapest ( where most Hungarians have probably become LFC supporters by now ).",

      "",
      "So a poster asked where will everyone play.",
      "I think you can sort of tell how we will play and where everyone will play based on two things –",
      "1. Who we bought (more specifically their skillset)",
      "2. The history of the manager",
      "We bought a bunch of players who all have one specific skill in common, and we have sold a bunch of players who don’t have it.\nUnder klopp the aim was to either win it back quick or if in our own half move the ball up top quick, this is why midfield was often workhorses and Trent was leaned on heavily for his passing. It’s also why klopp went for Darwen (a striker who if he timed his runs better would score lots of goals in that system).",
      "We sold Trent, we sold Darwen, we will probably sell Elliot as well. And we brought in kerkez, frimpong, ekitike, wirtz and (maybe?) isak. Anyone see what they have in common?",
      "They are all very good players at carrying the ball through defensive lines, same goes for McAllister and gravenberch. Rather than launching the ball forward as we did under klopp slot will rely more heavily on players keeping the ball at their feet and moving with it or short fast passing.",
      "2. He is a Dutch manager, another thing all these players have in common is they can play dual roles. So the worries about where will wirtz play if we sign isak etc are a bit unfounded. There is likely going to be a lot of swapping and changing similar to what PSG did in the champions League and Cruyff’s Barcelona used to do. The reason is this is a very difficult system to man mark and players like Mac and Salah will benefit as teams can’t double up.",
      "Stop worrying. He won the league in his first year with no signings, I’m sure he has a reason for the things he’s doing.\nLee",
      "",
      "Why Manchester United can shock everyone and win the title\nThere’s a quiet confidence building at Manchester United, and for once it’s not based on nostalgia or blind hope. It’s built on a manager who’s had a full pre-season, three new attackers who each bring something different, and a schedule with no European distractions. Add in rivals with their own uncertainties, and there’s a genuine case to be made: United can go all the way this season.",
      "Rúben Amorim finally gets his clean slate",
      "When Amorim came in last season, he was thrown into the middle of a campaign with someone else’s squad. This summer has been different. He’s had the time to drill his principles, set his standards, and build the side in his image. Amorim has shown he can win trophies in Portugal, but this is the first time he gets to start from zero at Old Trafford.",
      "An attack that looks genuinely dangerous",
      "If there’s been one major weakness in recent seasons, it’s that United’s attack has felt predictable. That’s no longer the case.",
      "Benjamin Šeško: Tall, quick, strong in the air, and able to finish with either foot. A proper focal point.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Direct, tireless, and difficult to mark. His runs inside from the right create space and his delivery from set pieces is a weapon.",
      "Matheus Cunha: The link man. Good close control, clever movement, and the ability to knit attacks together.",
      "This isn’t just adding more goals. It’s adding different types of goals – headers, long-range efforts, first-time finishes, link play – so opponents can’t predict the threat.",
      "No Europe, no problem",
      "One-game weeks are a huge advantage. No Thursday night flights, no rotating half the team for the weekend. It’s more rest, more tactical work, and more energy for the Premier League. Leicester used that to shock the world in 2015/16. Nottingham Forest in 2024/25 spent months in the top four when nobody expected it. A clear calendar can make a massive difference.",
      "The element of surprise",
      "Last season’s United was not Amorim’s United. This is. Opponents don’t yet know how to deal with Šeško, Mbeumo and Cunha together. That unpredictability could fuel a strong start, and in this league, early momentum can carry a team a long way.",
      "The rivals aren’t invincible",
      "Liverpool have brought in new players, but it always takes time for signings to bed in. Manchester City were a little off their usual pace last season and there’s no guarantee they’ll be flawless this time. Arsenal remain strong, but still need to prove they can go the distance under real pressure.",
      "Momentum is everything",
      "Title races often swing on ten-game bursts where a team collects 25 points or more. United have the conditions to produce one of those runs early on – a fresh squad, a manager’s system clicking into place, and new signings bringing belief. Get that run in before Christmas and the title talk becomes serious.",
      "It’s not about being the best on paper",
      "City are still favourites on paper, Arsenal probably look more settled, and Liverpool’s attack remains dangerous. But titles aren’t won on paper. They’re won on the pitch, in the grind, when preparation meets opportunity. Leicester proved it in 2016. Forest showed last season that sustained form over months is possible even for an outsider.",
      "United have the manager, the variety in attack, the focus of a one-game week, and rivals who may not be at full tilt. Keep the key players fit and make the most of the early fixtures, and this could be the season Old Trafford finally gets to celebrate the Premier League trophy again.",
      "Not blind optimism. A real possibility.\nMustafa",
      "",
      "A head of the game\nLast week I was going to write in about how Arsenal needed to adjust their playing style to suit Gyökeres’. That is sit back and give the opposition the ball so we can break away. I know it’s only a couple of freindles but it would appear he’s quite happy to adjust to ours, especially with the class of Zubimendi on the teamsheet!",
      "Apparently Gyōkeres can’t head for toffee….maybe that’s because Sporting didn’t play that sort football. They sit back and play breakaway football and don’t cross the ball in…..we do and Gyōkeres capatilised on them. Xubimendi looks class too.",
      "Looking forward to the Brighton flop playing for the Gooners!\nChris, Croydon",

I acknowledge this will anger the publishers of websites such as yours who depend on so-called fans rushing to agonise over every latest rumor, gossip, piece of misinformation regularly published in search of eyeballs for advertisements, but so be it.",
      "And second, I don’t think Newcastle United’s Inability to attract players is because the club is located somewhere near the Arctic Circle. As much as it pains me to say this, Sunderland appear to have done a really good job this summer bringing in new quality players (seven not including loanees) so I don’t think being located north of The Wall with WhiteWalkers our biggest fans plays much of a role here. I think in Newcstale’s case it has more to do with the breakdown in management since Amanda left. But again, I have no control over this, so do not worry.",

      "‘World class’ is the most subjective term in football. Almost everyone has a different definition of it. Some can’t even define it — myself included. Sometimes, you just know.",
      "It’s not all about statistics. The eye test means as much as the numbers on a screen, if not more. Then there’s consistency, which is the most important factor for me, Clive. Reliability and availability also matter.",
      "The most ridiculous definition I’ve heard is that being in the top five in your position makes you world class. By that logic, the fifth-best left-back is world class while the sixth-best striker isn’t, which is utter tosh.",
      "Throwing it around willy-nilly is also a red flag. It’s a sacred term, people. By my reckoning, there are only 16 world-class players in the Premier League. Some will say that’s far too few; others will think I’m being generous. Let us know what you think in the comments…without getting too angry.",
      "",
      "Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nStarting alphabetically by club, we kick off with Bukayo Saka. If you don’t rate him, your head needs a wobble — especially if you’re an England fan.",
      "At 23, he’s already world class and is the second-most valuable Premier League player on Transfermarkt at €150million (£129.9m).",
      "He gets unfair stick from rival fans, probably just because of who he plays for, but this one isn’t up for debate.",
      "",
      "Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nThe fact nobody talks about Rice’s £100million price tag speaks volumes. Out of every £70m+ Premier League signing, he’s one of only four whose fee isn’t used as a stick to beat him with.",
      "",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal)\nThe last of Arsenal’s three world-class players — though others are close. William Saliba is very, very near that level. Martin Zubimendi could get there if he adapts quickly to English football. Martin Odegaard disappointed last season, and Viktor Gyokeres needs to prove himself in the Premier League, even if he did score 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "But this is about Gabriel, who’s been among the best centre-backs in the world over the last three years. He’s better than Saliba, though for some reason doesn’t get the same PR. His set-piece threat is a nice bonus — even if defenders shouldn’t be known for goals.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nMr. Chippy Chips himself can now be regarded as world class after two brilliant years at Stamford Bridge. Helping Chelsea win the Club World Cup and secure a fourth-place league finish has made him a Ballon d’Or contender — even if we all know it’s obviously a two-horse race between Lamine Yamal and Ousmane Dembele.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo (Chelsea)\nA debatable one for some, but Caicedo’s defensive qualities set him apart from most Premier League midfielders. He’s also far tidier on the ball than he gets credit for. Like Rice, his £100m+ fee was mocked early on, but his consistency has been absolutely ridiculous.",
      "",
      "Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool)\nAnother outstanding season has cemented Mac Allister as a world-class midfielder.",
      "MORE F365 FEATURES…\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Man City, Liverpool and Man Utd stars among 10 possible James Maddison replacements for Spurs\n👉 Liverpool pivot to Barcola exposes Isak ‘chase’ as extraordinary opportunism\n👉 Levy’s Neville chat proves he still doesn’t *get* Spurs and probably never will",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe only new signing in this list. I’m confident he’ll be brilliant for Liverpool, but yes — the Bundesliga tax is real. Any reservations are fair.",
      "",
      "Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\nHis season tailed off after the Reds wrapped up the title, but his 2024/25 numbers were still outrageous. Just look at these stats from Salah.",
      "",
      "Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\nStill doing it at 34 and post-ACL injury, Van Dijk remains a joke of a footballer. How is he getting better? It makes no sense.",
      "",
      "Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nIf you thought Salah’s stats were good, have a look at these. Haaland has 124 goals in 146 games for City and has been taking the p*ss out of the Premier League since day one.",
      "MORE: Ronaldo, Mbappe and Haaland top football’s highest earners as Messi misses out",
      "",
      "Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City)\nProbably the player I’m least certain about here. Still, at only 23, Gvardiol has the potential to become the best defender in the world.",
      "",
      "Rodri (Manchester City)\nAfter missing most of last season with an ACL injury, Rodri is expected back after the first international break. He’s still the Ballon d’Or holder and one of the best midfielders in the game. It will be interesting to see how he performs post-injury.",
      "",
      "Ruben Dias (Manchester City)\nSlightly past his peak, but still world class. Injuries are becoming more of a problem, and if his availability drops further he could lose that label.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)\nComfortably United’s only world-class player. Bruno carried a shambolic side last season. The arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko should take some of the pressure off him. Whether Sesko is another Rasmus Hojlund or the next Robin van Persie remains to be seen.",
      "And no, there’s no Phil Foden.",
      "",
      "F365 SAYS: Sesko over Watkins? Man Utd take Hojlund, Zirkzee risk again over what’s really important",
      "",
      "Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nThe question is whether he’ll be a world-class striker for Newcastle…or for Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Sandro Tonali (Newcastle United)\nMidfield is where the Premier League is stacked with world-class talent. Even if Tonali is ranked behind Mac Allister, Rice, and Caicedo, it doesn’t matter — he’s still in that bracket. Criminally underrated and seriously, seriously good."

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – £66.2m/€76.5m (RB Leipzig to Manchester United, August 2025)\nThe hope is that Sesko can be enough of a success in his first permanent spell outside the Red Bull bubble to trigger a further £7.36m in add-ons in this ongoing Manchester United rebuild. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have set the bar high.",
      "",
      "13) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "14) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "15) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "16) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nTwo trophies, 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances might well have activated clauses taking the deal to the full £85m in cost but Liverpool will be thrilled to get half their money back from Al-Hilal in truth.",
      "",
      "17) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "18) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "19) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "20) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Manchester United beat Fiorentina on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Snapdragon Cup at Old Trafford that saw Benjamin Sesko introduced to the crowd as their new striker.",
      "Sesko's move from RB Leipzig for a fee rising to £73.7m was confirmed on the morning of the match and he was presented to supporters on the pitch alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who both started for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "With the £50m revamp of their Carrington training ground also unveiled this week, there is a growing sense of renewal at United, although it did not take long for Fiorentina to pierce that when Simon Sohm seized upon sloppy defending to put the visitors ahead at a corner.",
      "United levelled it up midway through the first half when Bruno Fernandes whipped in a cross that Robin Gosens appeared to divert over the line amid a melee of bodies. David de Gea, honoured beforehand by his old club, was among those complaining of a foul.",
      "Sohm almost scored again after the break, striking the United crossbar. Fernandes, Harry Maguire and, in particular, Cunha searched for a winner for the home side in a second half that saw young defender Ayden Heaven depart the field due to an injury.",

      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:05, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "Manchester United's deal for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.",
      "Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 23:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "Manchester United bid just under £74m to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle's second bid was higher - an initial offer of just under £70m plus add-ons; Sesko has been open to both projects - but has a preference towards joining Man Utd over Newcastle",
      "Wednesday 6 August 2025 11:03, UK",
      "Manchester United are advancing in talks with RB Leipzig over a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko, after making an offer worth an initial £65m plus £8.9m in add-ons.",
      "There is no full agreement yet, but discussions are heading in a positive direction.",
      "Newcastle have also been working on a deal for Sesko, and earlier on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, which was higher than Manchester United's - after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "However, Manchester United have moved their base fee closer to £69.6m (€80m), plus possible add-ons, in talks with Leipzig, Sky Germany report.",
      "The structure of the offer is still being discussed so Leipzig have not yet accepted Manchester United's current bid.",
      "Sky Germany believes it would need further improvement - while Newcastle's offer of a guaranteed of £69.6m (€80m), plus add-ons, meets the requirements.",
      "Personal terms are not expected to be an issue with either club - but there is a growing feeling that Sesko wants to go to Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker, who has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, trained indoors away from the team at Leipzig's training complex on Tuesday.",
      "Sesko has a great relationship with RB Leipzig and is being totally respectful to them. He wants to ensure if he leaves, he does so on good terms. He is ready to fly to the UK once an agreement is struck.",
      "Manchester United's bid for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement.",
      "Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "\"Newcastle have been internally concerned that if Manchester United come to the table, Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"Manchester United's offer, totalling £65m plus around £8.9m (€75m + €10m), is short of Newcastle's. They offered around £5m more.",
      "\"Newcastle have offered more up front and more in total but Manchester United have come to the table.",
      "\"He is open to both moves and it is not that he is against Newcastle - but if it came to the two, Manchester United would be the choice.",
      "\"We are yet to hear back from RB Leipzig on Newcastle or Manchester United's offer.",
      "\"It is a confusing situation. Internally, [Newcastle] were given encouragement that the player would be up for a move.",
      "\"It feels, from the noises we are hearing, that Leipzig will leave it up to the player to decide. We have not heard the last of this one. There will be more negotiations to come.\"",

      "Manchester United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Manchester United and Newcastle are locked in a battle for Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",

      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",
