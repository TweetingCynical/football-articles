      "Former Manchester United first-team coach Rene Meulensteen has given his verdict on if Cristiano Ronaldo should start for Portugal against France on Friday in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's former right-hand man, Rene Meulensteen, has given his stark opinion on Cristiano Ronaldo's Euro 2024 performances for Portugal.",
      "His verdict was revealed on talkSPORT's YouTube channel as Jim White and Alex Crook interviewed the former Manchester United first-team coach. Meulensteen has claimed that Portugal manager Roberto Martinez has got to address Ronaldo's lack of free-kick goals for his country at Euro 2024 as he noted that the game is beginning to \"run away\" from the elite athlete.",
      "TalkSPORT co-host Alex Crooks asked Meulensteen: \"Are they a better team without him in it, Portugal? He takes every free kick, blazes every free kick into the stands.\" And the former assistant to Sir Alex said: \"Yeah well, that to me is something I think that needs to be addressed because the stats don't help.\"",
      "Meulensteen also discussed the Portugal frontman's emotional state during and after the round of 16 game against Slovenia - where he burst into tears after seeing his penalty saved by Jan Oblak, but then went on to score one in the shoot-out after extra time.",
      "The former United coach said: \"Well, it's all about perception isn't it? First of all, I thought when that penalty shoot-out came about, I thought this is going to be interesting because he's only going to take one or another penalty – he's either the first one or number five, the last one.",
      "\"And I was pleasantly surprised for him to step up and take the first one because he knew, 'I need to take the responsibility, I need to put this right to get us off of the wrong foot'. So that to me was a good sign of character.\"",
      "Meulensteen added: \"What happened after the game showed his determination and his desire to win things and to do well that is so strong. He's got the highest expectations of himself and everybody around him. He expects the highest standards of himself and everybody else, and if he doesn't meet those standards - which he didn't - then obviously you get that reaction from him.\"",
      "Meulensteen also noted that Ronaldo needs to justify his claim of taking free-kicks for Portugal by boosting his conversion rate. He explained: \"The only way to justify it [taking free kicks] is to put one in the top corner and that is obviously what he's got in his mind but the stats don't back that up and the thing is, you know with every team normally, you've got a clear plan with everything in terms of the corners, who takes them and the free kicks and this and that and the other.",
      "\"He sees them [free kicks] as an opportunity but it's not working and I think it's the manager's job to address that.\"",
      "Jim White, the former Sky Sports Transfer Deadline Day presenter, asked Meulensteen if he would put Ronaldo in the starting XI for Portugal's game against France on Friday night. White posed the question: \"If you were Martinez, I'm going to do it, I'm going to put you in that spot, would you play him in this game against the French on Friday, would you start him?\"",
      "Meulensteen replied: \"Yeah, I would start him, yeah I would.\" White then asked: \"Would you say anything specific to him before he went out?\"",
      "The former United coach, who is now an assistant coach for the Australian national team, said: \"I would probably have a clear conversation with him then with the leadership group and also in the tactical way that we, if we think we're going to beat France then I expect something different from you, from you, from you and from you.",
      "\"And the only way we can do that is if we pull together and let everybody play to their strength, so therefore this is how we're going to do it.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag is here to stay at Man United and will be looking to improve his squad this summer transfer window following an FA Cup winning season at Old Trafford",
      "Manchester United are set to bring in new recruits this transfer window on the back of extending manager Erik ten Hag's stay at Old Trafford.",
      "While departures are set to be plentiful at United this summer, the arrivals lounge may also be busy as the new hierarchy looks to continue building the club for success.",
      "A bid for Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite has already been rejected, while French pair Anthony Martial and Raphael Varane have left the club after their contracts expired.",
      "But business is far from finished, with another centre-back tipped to arrive, Branthwaite to be further pursued, and a new name odds-on to join the Red Devils' forward line.",
      "After playing perhaps the best football of his career under Ten Hag at Ajax, De Ligt has fallen out of favour at his current club Bayern Munich and a switch to Old Trafford has been mooted.",
      "A £68million signing from Juventus, De Ligt hasn't lived up the expectations that surrounded him following Ajax's run to the Champions League semi-final in 2019.",
      "Scoring in both the quarter-final against eventual club Juventus, and semi-final, where Ajax infamously fell to Tottenham, De Ligt was one of the hottest centre-back prospects on the market.",
      "Failing to settle in Italy meant that the Bayern move could act as a reprieve, but the Dutchman now finds himself behind former Tottenham and England man Eric Dier in the pecking order.",
      "United's centre-back roster is far from what they'd like it to be at the minute with Varane having departed and both Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire likely to leave, so it is essential that an elite-level defender arrive to partner Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Reports suggest De Ligt would cost the Red Devils £40million, a far cry from the near-£70million that Everton requested for Branthwaite.",
      "Bayern's interest in Germany and Leverkusen centre-half Johnathan Tah all but confirms that De Ligt will head for the exit, and United are the most likely suitors.",
      "With the aging Casemiro creeping towards a potential departure, a holding midfielder is another vacancy that United's new regime are keen to fill.",
      "The name that is being heavily linked with a move to United is Uruguayan commander Manuel Ugarte, who currently plays for French champions PSG.",
      "Lighting up this year's Copa America, Ugarte has played almost every minute of Uruguay's so-far impeccable campaign, attracting interest from Premier League clubs.",
      "Having only left Sporting CP last summer to join Les Parisiens for around £50million, Ugarte fell out of favour with manager Luis Enrique.",
      "A catalyst for the Uruguayan being dropped from the strarting XI was his lacklustre performance against Newcastle in the Champions league - where he was substituted after just 64 minutes.",
      "Chelsea were incredibly close to bringing Ugarte to England last summer, and a deal was agreed, but PSG reportedly offered a better wage packet and the Blues ended up with Brighton's Moises Caicedo instead.",
      "Now, the holding midfielder looks to potentially be on his way to England again in a move that could see him swap clubs for as little as £35million - £15million less than was paid for services just a year prior.",
      "Ugarte could provide the stability in midfield that United have been craving, but any deal would most likely have to wait until his Copa America is over.",
      "Dutch forward Zirkzee was a standout for Bologna in Serie A last season as they unexpectedly secured Champions League football under Thiago Motta.",
      "Having left Feyenoord's academy for Bayern Munich's, Zirkzee rose through the ranks after scoring a hat-trick for the Bavarian club's reserves on his debut.",
      "He made his first team debut against Tottenham in the Champions League in 2019 group stage, and was loaned out to Parma in January 2021.",
      "Injuries scuppered his first loan move, but his second the following season saw him head to Anderlecht in Belgium where he became the club's top scorer with 15 league goals - 18 in all competitions.",
      "Zirkzee was unable to assert any claim on Bayern's squad despite the goals, and was shipped out to Bologna in 2022 for as just £7.2million.",
      "He was top scorer for his club again last season, and United now look set to recruit the Dutchman whose contract reportedly has a £34million release clause.",
      "Bologna will be upset to lose their star forward for such a relatively small fee, but United will be glad to hopefully add his goals to a forward line that stuttered at times last season.",
      "With players like Jadon Sancho and Antony linked with moves away, and Martial having already left, a new forward is essential and Zirkzee fits the bill.",
      "A transfer that may turn out to be one of the sagas of the summer, young centre-back Branthwaite has been linked with United for some time now.",
      "Arriving at current club Everton from Carlisle United in 2020, the defender has enjoyed loan spells at Blackburn and PSV Eindhoven before returning to become part of the first-team last season under Sean Dyche.",
      "Branthwaite was nothing short of a revelation for the Toffees, combining his powerful defending with the netting of some crucial goals against Tottenham and Liverpool as they avoided the drop for the second year running.",
      "His performances at Goodsion Park lead to him being called up to Gareth Southgate's provisional England squad for Euro 2024, and saw him earn his first international cap against Bosnia at Wembley.",
      "With centre-half a desperate need for Man United, Branthwaite made sense, but the valuations that both United and Everton held were vastly different.",
      "An opening bid of just £35million plus add-ons was far below the reported £70million valuation that Everton have placed on the defender, and so the deal has stalled.",
      "With the De Ligt transfer looking like the preferred option, the potential for both defenders to arrive at United still remains a possibility considering the departures that United will sanction.",
      "If Lindelof and Maguire were to leave, this would open up positions within the squad, so there is no writing off the idea that United will sign two premier centre-backs this summer.",
      "A lesser known name but another possible arrival, Spanish left-back Gutierrez could be poised to fill a position that United have been desperate for consistency in for some time.",
      "Currently at Spanish side Girona, where he arrived in 2022, the defender aided his side in reaching the Champions League for the first time in their history last season.",
      "His performances drew interest from a range of clubs and it is reported that Liverpool and Arsenal were both interested in the player before he seemingly chose United.",
      "It may not be Girona whose pocket the reported £34million fee will fill if this transfer goes ahead, however, as Gutierrez joined from champions Real Madrid who have a minimal buy-back clause on the defender.",
      "The plan would be that Los Blancos purchase the player back from Girona only to sell him on to the Red Devils.",
      "This isn't the first time that the player has been linked to United either, as in 2017 former United coach Jose Mourinho was keen on bringing in the defender who eventually decided on remaining in Madrid.",
      "Both Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia haven't been able to string a consistent spell of games together in the position that Gutierrez would fill.",

      "Eric Cantona's vicious kick at an abusive Crystal Palace fan had direct consequences for Gary Lineker, who was appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit back in 1995",
      "Eric Cantona’s infamous Manchester United kung-fu kick caused Gary Lineker a huge problem on one of his first ever Match of the Day appearances.",
      "Imagery of Cantona launching himself at a Crystal Palace fan in the Selhurst Park stands is ingrained in the minds of every English football fan. The maverick Frenchman had been sent off for a wild tackle during the fixture on January 25, 1995, but saw red again after being told to go “back to France”, along with some more colourful language, by a Palace supporter.",
      "The rest is history, with Cantona’s assault resulting in him receiving a £20,000 fine, two weeks in jail and a nine-month ban from playing football. And it had repercussions for a nervous and fresh-faced Lineker, who was stumped when asked for his thoughts on the incident on the BBC’s flagship sports programme - which he has since presented for 25 years.",
      "Lineker revealed his difficult position at the time while speaking to Cantona on The Rest Is Football podcast. “That was one of my first ever appearances on Match of the Day as a pundit,” the 63-year-old anchor said.",
      "“He’s gone to me ‘so what did you make of that?’ and I thought ‘Oh my God, I never expected to have to deal with this, thank you very much, Eric’,” resulting in a chuckle from Cantona.",
      "The former Red Devils man had been asked if he had any regrets regarding his career by Alan Shearer, whose Blackburn Rovers side beat United to the Premier League title that season. Cantona jokingly responded: “I have one regret, if it didn’t happen you wouldn't have won the Premier League – it was when I was banned in 1995.”",
      "Explaining his moment of incredible head loss, he added: “Sometimes we are fragile. In football, it’s all about provocation from the fans. The fans can use any type of thing to help their team to win.",
      "“But sometimes it’s difficult to say that because we cannot accept racist chants from the stands, because he said something about me being French. I heard that thousands of times before, that’s football.”",
      "Shearer then chimed in by saying: “I can only say thank you because we might not have won the league if you haven’t done it so I was your biggest f***ing fan when you did that!”",
      "Blackburn went on to win the league, a feat they have not managed since, by a single point. Cantona’s absence proved a huge blow for runners-up United, having scored 12 league goals and notched five assists until he was suspended for the remainder of the season.",

      "They have been team-mates at Manchester United and for Portugal, but some people have thought that Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes would clash",
      "When the going has got tough, Bruno Fernandes has always launched a staunch defence of Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Fans were left frustrated on Fernandes' behalf this pas week during Portugal's narrow win over Slovenia in the Euro 2024 Round of 16. This stemmed from Ronaldo taking four free-kicks in dangerous positions - and not coming close to scoring any of them.",
      "Ronaldo then missed a spot-kick in extra-time, which would've prevented the match from going to a penalty shootout. Ronaldo's insistence of taking all the set pieces only added to many supporters' feeling that the pair, who have played together at Manchester United as well as at international level, do not see eye-to-eye.",
      "The seeds of this rumour were planted when Fernandes looked to have given Ronaldo the cold shoulder in the Portugal changing room, soon after the 39-year-old chastised United in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "When the video first emerged without sound, a Sky Sports journalist said it looked like the pair were exchanging jibes at each other. Fernandes quickly replied: “They put the sound on after, did you hear it with the sound?",
      "\"You have to hear it. In Portugal, we have a problem that I was watching on one of the channels that was talking about that. [They were saying] ‘It was cold, it was bad’ for about 45 minutes. All of a sudden, they go for a break and the national team put it up with the sound and the sound says that he’s joking with me.",
      "“They came back and said there was a joke, and they cut there. They they said ‘If you want to see again, just go back’, but if they go back, they will see that was a problem. But if they tell the truth, if they explain what was in that video, people will know, but now people don’t know.",
      "“As I said, this is national team, Manchester United will be my focus after the World Cup. I have no problem with anyone. One time a manager said to be ‘Everything that you can control is yourself’. I think everyone thinks the same way.\"",
      "Ronaldo and Fernandes appeared to have developed a friendly understanding during Portugal's 3-0 victory over Turkey. The five-time Ballon d'Or was played through on goal, but instead of shooting, he cut the ball across to Fernandes for a tap-in.",
      "While Fernandes would have appreciated Ronaldo's pass then, he, as would all of the Portugal players, would've been extremely frustrated by the iconic forward's insistence of taking every free-kick within range of the goal. Ronaldo did not come close to scoring from any of his dead ball situations, which were more often than not more than 30 yards away from goal.",
      "He is yet to score a single goal across the whole competition and has not found the net for the national side since he scored two goals in a friendly against Ireland last month. Ronaldo will almost certainly start in Portugal's quarter-final clash against France.",
      "Considering how strong France are, Portugal will need to make any and every opportunity they get to score count. Considering Ronaldo's recent struggles with his set pieces, legendary England forward Gary Lineker thinks Fernandes is the better taker. “It is almost impossible, despite the fact his record is something like one in 60 that he’s scored in tournaments,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast",
      "“Bruno Fernandes is a better free-kick taker and a more varied free-kick taker than Ronaldo. So while he’s [Ronaldo] a massive strength, he can also be a weakness as well.\"",

The Spaniard had an inconsistent time working under Erik ten Hag, as he came in and out of the team before United ended his time with the club prematurely in the January transfer window.",

Reguilon, who arrived at Tottenham in a £28million deal in 2020, had more joy on loan at Brentford last term where he made 16 appearances and provided four assists.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo's former Real Madrid and Juventus team-mate Sami Khedira has revealed the rule that the Portuguese star created after spotting a young player's gym habit",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo laid down a strict rule for one of his young team-mates in the gym.",
      "Former Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira spent more than six seasons with Ronaldo as their paths crossed at Real Madrid, as well as in Turin. The pair won plenty of trophies together, including three league titles and the Champions League, but the former Germany international also watched how Ronaldo’s role changed over the years.",
      "Having experienced the former Manchester United forward become a Real Madrid legend, Khedira was greeted with a wiser version of Ronaldo at Juventus. The World Cup winner revealed how Ronaldo once gave some stern advice to a young star after spotting his gym habit.",
      "“I saw two different Cristiano Ronaldos,” Khedira told Rio Ferdinand ’s FIVE YouTube Channel. “One when he was with Real Madrid, when he was a bit younger, and his ego was maybe a bit too much.",
      "“Then he came to Juventus. When he came into the dressing room, he was interacting with all his team-mates and trying to help them as well. He’s an inspirational character.",
      "“When he came to Juventus, Federico Chiesa was a fantastic young player. [Chiesa] had his phone in his hand and was walking into the gym and Cristiano looked at him like, ‘What are you doing? Where are you going?’",
      "Recalling Chiesea’s reaction, Khedira said: “He was like, ‘I’m going to the gym.’” Ronaldo is claimed to have given Chiesa some clear instructions: “‘With your phone? Listen, you don’t need your phone. Go in the gym and work. Don’t do Instagram, don’t do any TikToks, focus on your work.’”",
      "Have your say! Will Cristiano Ronaldo help Portugal win Euro 2024? Tell us in the comments section below",
      "Khedira remembers that Chiesa hurriedly changed his mind and replied, “‘OK, OK, I’m going without my phone!’” This would have been during Chiesa’s first season at Juventus and the advice paid off, with the forward ending the 2020/21 campaign with 26 goal contributions for Juventus and a Euro 2020 winners’ medal.",
      "It was not just Chiesa who Ronaldo influenced during training. Though Ronaldo’s time at Juventus may not have been a trophy-laden success, Khedira insists that he helped raise the team’s standards and explained how the former United hero differs from his online persona.",
      "“Even the quality of training when he came to Juventus was like a different level afterwards because every single shot on target was like, ‘I need to score,’” Khedira explained to Ferdinand. “[He’d] play games for a bottle of wine or a dinner, he’s always a competitive guy but also a really friendly, nice and humble guy, from my point of view.",
      "“All this Instagram or social media stuff, when he’s showing off his 150 cars and his rings, that’s not the real him. Maybe it’s kind of his role but in the locker room or if you go for dinner with him, he’s a funny and amazing guy.”",

      "A new centre-half is priority No.1 for Manchester United, and their failed pursuit of Jarrad Branthwaite has left the England international frustrated - with attention now turning to Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite has grown frustrated with his stalling move to Manchester United - who are still looking to clear the decks to fund a summer move.",
      "Everton centre-back Branthwaite has been on United's radar for some time after impressing in the Premier League and being called up to England's provisional Euro 2024 squad. United saw an opening offer of £35million plus add-ons rejected by the Toffees, who have slapped a £70million price tag on his head.",
      "That has seen United turn their attention to Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt, with the Dutchman available for around £40million and a deal in the offing.",
      "The club remain fans of Branthwaite and would still like to get a deal over the line this summer, with incoming assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy a huge fan of the left-footed defender, and having worked with him previously at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "They need exits though this summer and while they will listen to offers for all but a very select few. But among those they're most keen to push out and raise big funds with are the likes of Casemiro, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, Antony and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Saudi clubs are keen on ex-Real Madrid and Brazil star Casemiro but have baulked at a £30million valuation so far, while Lindelof has just one year left on his deal and could go for around £15million.",
      "West Ham wanted Maguire last summer and agreed a fee only for him to stay put, but with Max Kilman on his way from Wolves for £40million, they may not return for the England man.",
      "To bring in both Branthwaite and De Ligt would see both pushed down the pecking order, where fit-again Lisandro Martinez is Ten Hag's No.1 choice.",
      "Winger Antony cost the Red Devils £86million, but they'll be getting nowhere near that back if they decide to sell the Brazilian this summer. Losing too much on the ex-Ajax man - of whom Ten Hag is a staunch advocate - may well be enough to keep him in situ at Old Trafford.",
      "It's a different case with Sancho however. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund, helping them to a Champion League final, but with his relationship with Ten Hag at rock bottom, unless there is a drop in the tension between the two, he's likely to be pushed out again - if they can find a buyer.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ensured Manchester United have undergone a significant transformation after becoming co-owner and his stance will mean little if the Red Devils don't find success",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is no stranger to bold rhetoric. But Manchester United's perceived saviour must find a way of translating his grandiose words into the hard currency of success at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe has wasted little time in transforming the set-up at United, insisting the environment at the club was ultimately to blame for the drift and turmoil that has blighted the club in the 11 years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Appointing a new CEO in Omar Berrada, new sporting director in Dan Ashworth and new technical director in Jason Wilcox shows Ratcliffe's determination to build the best possible structure for long-term success at United after what he branded a “slow degradation” over the past decade.",
      "In a matter of months, Ratcliffe has done more to engage with United supporters and be open about his intentions for the club that despised majority owners the Glazers have done in nearly 20 years in charge.",
      "While the Glazers have chosen a policy of omerta, Ratcliffe has gone the opposite way, meeting with fan representatives and local community leaders, to gauge their perspective and ascertain how best to work with them as he plots United's route back to the top.",
      "But Ratcliffe knows actions speak louder than words and that, ultimately, he and his team will be judged on how United perform on the pitch, rather than on soundbites and a willingness to ingratiate themselves with the right people.",
      "What Ratcliffe has publicly acknowledged, which has been evident for some time but allowed to continue at United, is the flagrant overspending on players worth nowhere near the fees paid for them, coupled with the failure to bring sufficient money in for those the club decides to let go.",
      "Speaking last month, Ratcliffe said: “Since the day Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill retired, 11 seasons ago, if you compare United with Real Madrid, who have consistently performed well, the net spend on players at United is £1.1billion. At Real Madrid it's £200m [so United have spent ] immensely more - £900m more.”",
      "In another recent interview, Ratcliffe outlined his desire to take United to the level of Real, indisputably the biggest club in Europe, with a peerless 15 European Cups to their name, while acknowledging it will take many years to achieve that stated aim. Ratcliffe also gave praise to Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, describing him as “an extremely good businessman\" who \"runs a really good football club” - the inference being the model of United's rivals is one the fallen giants must strive to emulate.",
      "There is a mood of optimism and change among United fans, following the arrival of Ratcliffe, who has shown his ruthless streak with his controversial plan to cull 250 of the club's 1,100-strong employees, to cut costs and improve efficiency at the club. Such a move, allied to his propensity for firing off emails to United staff about the untidiness of some departments at the club and the need for every employee to raise standards in all areas, may not have endeared Ratcliffe to the Old Trafford workforce.",
      "But Ratcliffe, one of Britain's richest men, estimated to be worth £29bn, is not interested in a popularity contest. The 71-year-old is a ruthless businessman, who has conducted a forensic audit of every aspect at United and is embarking on what he deems are necessary measures to make the team and the club one of the best again, domestically and in Europe.",
      "That target was outlined by Ten Hag, speaking after it was confirmed United had triggered an option to extend his existing contract until 2026. That extension affords Ten Hag an element of security, but a similarly poor start to the season – United lost eight times in the league by Christmas last year – would test Ratcliffe's resolve to keep faith with him and leave him under pressure to appoint a new manager.",
      "While Ratcliffe's PR has been sound since taking charge of football operations at United, he and his team will be judged on how they perform in this summer's transfer window and whether the changes made behind the scenes yield the expected results on the pitch and make the team competitive and relevant again, after more than a decade of dormancy.",

      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has plenty to do now that he's committed his future to the club until 2026. And on that note, here's what we reckon should be top of his to-do pile",
      "Erik ten Hag has signed a new deal at Manchester United, which means he can finally get to work.",
      "After overseeing arguably the club's worst-ever campaign in Premier League history last season, Ten Hag has plenty to do to get United out of the funk they've seemed so incapable of escaping over the past year or so. His side ended up eighth in the table, a whopping 31 points behind champions Manchester City, and lost 19 games in all competitions.",
      "Last month's FA Cup final triumph, and the performance that went with it, provided a much-needed mood lift after nine months of doom and gloom, but it wasn't nearly enough to sweep their torrid season under the rug. As such, the next few months could be make or break for the Dutchman.",
      "With that in mind, here are five things Ten Hag needs to sort out as soon as possible after extending his stay at Old Trafford to ensure next season is plane sailing.",
      "First and foremost, Ten Hag needs to address the elephant in the room: Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't really want him. Almost as soon as the billionaire's minority stake in the club was confirmed at the start of the year, rumours started swirling that he was lining up replacements for the Dutchman.",
      "The club then spent a couple of weeks after the season's end speaking to other managers, including former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, before ultimately deciding to stick rather than twist. Such overt flirtation with other coaches suggests the axe could fall on Ten Hag's neck as soon as United hit another rough patch, so the former Ajax boss must find a way to convince Ratcliffe he's worth sticking with, and fast.",
      "There are plenty of holes to patch in United's squad, particularly at the back and in midfield. The club have been pushing for a new centre-back, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Jarrad Branthwaite and Marc Guehi on their radar, and are strongly linked with a move for PSG midfielder Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Nabbing two or three high-quality players this summer could be the difference between a strong start to the season and a tepid one, so getting his ducks in order here should be a top priority for Ten Hag.",
      "Similarly, getting the futures of the likes of Jadon Sancho, Casemiro and Harry Maguire sorted needs to be done ASAP, with all three rumoured to be on the chopping block. Sancho's issues with Ten Hag are well documented, and failure to either get rid of or patch things up with the Englishman could cause serious problems. Meanwhile, Casemiro and Maguire, both of whom are on huge wages, will need to be moved on if United sign new players in their positions",
      "FA Cup win notwithstanding, the mood around Old Trafford is positively grim at the moment. Confidence has arguably never been lower, not only amongst the players but also amongst the supporters, and Ten Hag needs to address this problem sharpish.",
      "It'll take a lot of work to banish the ghosts of last season, but a strong, positive pre-season, coupled with a few smart signings and sensible departures could inject a little life and belief back into the squad. If he can get the players firing on all cylinders, the fans, and more importantly, Ratcliffe, will be back on his side in no time.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "Marcus Rashford's form last season was concerning. The 26-year-old scored just eight goals in all competitions, with just two of them coming before Christmas.",
      "The fact that he bagged 30 goals the season before goes to show how vital it'll be to get the best out of him, and how much United's season could hinge on which version of Rashford turns up at the start of the campaign next month. If Ten Hag can find a way to turn Rashford from a purple patch player into a ruthlessly consistent difference-maker then he'll be on easy street - and it'll take a little pressure off Rasmus Hojlund's shoulders too!",
      "United suffered 60 different injuries last season, and losing key players like Varane, Hojlund, Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Luke Shaw and Casemiro for long periods hamstrung them and stopped them from ever getting into any sort of rhythm.",
      "Preventing the same thing from happening next season is an absolute must, and whether that means tweaking training methods, leaning more on the medical team, or being a tad more patient with recovery times - as, reportedly, wasn't the case last season - then Ten Hag really ought to do it.",

      "Ten Hag has signed a two-year contract extension with the Red Devils despite his disappointing second season in charge. That puts Sancho in an awkward position, with the winger having fallen out with the Dutchman last September.",

The England international hit back at those claims, even accusing his manager of lying. Sancho was subsequently shipped out on loan to Borussia Dortmund, where he impressed. But he is now back at United, with the Bundesliga side unable to afford the fee it would take to bring him back permanently.",
      "Mirror Football reported last month that Sancho would be willing to return to United, but only if Ten Hag was sacked. That obviously will not now happen, with the Dutchman set to remain for the long-term.",
      "Sancho is thought to be reluctant to give up on his United career, though he is said to realise that he has no future under Ten Hag. He is keen to remain playing at the highest level, having starred in Dortmund's run to the Champions League final.",
      "A return to Signal Iduna Park would likely be his best option, though that would likely have to be on another loan deal. Sancho could of course try to force his way into Ten Hag's plans, though the United boss has already hinted he is ready to sanction the winger's exit.",

      "In a further sign that Sancho should prepare to leave Old Trafford this summer, Ten Hag has made it clear he has the full backing of club chiefs over his vision for the squad and recruitment.",
      "“I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together. Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,\" he said.",
      "“However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.",

      "Newcastle have wasted no time in replacing Dan Ashworth - bringing in Paul Mitchell as their sporting director - with the Englishman previously on Manchester United's shortlist",
      "Newcastle have moved quickly to land Paul Mitchell as their sporting director - replacing Dan Ashworth.",
      "The Magpies had one of the best domestic operators at the helm at St James' Park before Manchester United turned his head. After a stubborn stand off a resolution was found that allowed Ashworth to head to Old Trafford - but Newcastle haven't rested on their laurels.",
      "Those within the game may argue that the north east club haven't had to settle at all, in fact Mitchell too was on Sir Jim Ratcliffe's radar when he considered who to bring in as his new sporting director.",
      "Mitchell's stock has continued to rise throughout his career, doing impressive work at Southampton, Tottenham and Monaco. His time in France broadened his horizon and he helped the Ligue 1 outfit to land players who've gone on to achieve huge things, whilst working within a budget and keeping the club's academy at the forefront of everything they do.",
      "At Tottenham he, despite criticism from his own coaches, chose to sign Son-Heung min. The South Korean has gone on to become one of the best buys in modern Premier League history and Mitchell certainly takes every element of the club into consideration when making any decision.",
      "When he was in the south of France Mitchell did an interview with club media and said the overall plan was: \"Finding a great balance of developing and exposing our young talent from the academy, to our signings, to our investment and integrating nicely into the more mature elements of our group.\"",
      "It was Mitchell for example who created a thriving environment that allowed Aurélien Tchouaméni to flourish. The French midfielder eventually left for Real Madrid and could end up earning Monaco €100million.",
      "Tchouaméni is still a young player and that has been central to Mitchell's plans. He said: \"We want to give young players an opportunity to grow and develop\" but admitted that \"with any young group consistency is a hard balance to find.\"",
      "At Newcastle he will find a host of young talents who continue to mature and blossom. Some of those are already leading lights at St James' Park - the likes of Alexander Isak, 24, Anthony Gordon, 23 and Sandro Tonali, 24, all have their best years ahead of them.",
      "Lewis Miley, the 18-year-old midfielder who had a breakout year last term, is among those who may benefit from Mitchell's arrival and influence.",
      "Mitchell made it known that, in order to compliment and aid the young talent, having experienced leaders in the dressing room to drive the culture was key. Monaco signed Cesc Fabregas from Chelsea and he played at the club well into his 30s, remaining a sounding board for the whole squad.",
      "The sporting director said: \"The attitude of our older players is the key fabric that in the dressing room brings it all together.\" Newcastle only have two players outside of the back four who are 30 or over with their age profile incredibly lower. The capture of a player, more for their IQ and experience, could therefore be on the cards, especially as the club, who don't have a winning history of late, attempt to join clubs who deal in success annually.",
      "Not solely limited to recruitment and selling though, Mitchell has made it clear that every area will be exhausted to find little wins for the team. \"More important for me it is off the pitch - driving standards in each and every department,\" he said. \"Psychology, sport science, medicine, nutrition, the way we travel, the way we refuel. Every element we need to keep pushing to its maximum.\"",
      "If the Red Devils have been accused of not doing their due diligence over the years when it comes to transfer deaings, Mitchell cannot be accused of the same. He's underlined the need to have a clear plan in place and not freak out after a poor run of results of an injury in a key position.",
      "Newcastle have struck a good balance in the market since their Saudi owners came on board and their new sporting director's philosophy is to do exactly the same. \"People look at modern recruitment as very reactionary and very emotional - when I came to Monaco and other clubs it has to be more premeditated,\" he told Sky Sports.",
      "Ashworth, for all the brilliant plaudits he's enjoyed, has been accused of failing to do the necessary work when signing Tonali. He was the marquee signing from AC Milan 12 months ago but a history of gambling issues meant he was quickly banned and has barely featured.",
      "He is expected to come good - but Newcastle have seen a very expensive asset sit on the sidelines for months. Mitchell believes \"investments, if made badly, can haunt and stop progression for a long, long time after that.\"",
      "One investment he made, but was criticised for, was signing Son whilst at Tottenham. Doubts existed of his finishing, but Mitchell didn't believe that sentiment had legs and the strike record of the South Korean showed that sporting director was more than within his rights to back himself - something he will no doubt continue to do in the north east.",
      "He said: \"I took a lot of criticism in my first year at Tottenham, Sonny was at the centre of that, which was a bit of a learning for me. Players are humans, they need time, need to be able to settle. Sonny had a great record at Hamburg and Leverkusen, but there was this narrative that he wasn't a good finisher and I said to a staff member 'you're wrong' because his history shows he is a very astute finisher.

      "Erik ten Hag isn't exactly one for taking prisoners and has spent the last two years making considerable changes to Manchester United's first team, including banishing certain players",
      "Four of the five players Erik ten Hag banished from Manchester United's first team dressing room have now left the club.",
      "Since arriving at Old Trafford in 2022, Ten Hag has done his utmost to mould the squad in his image and hasn't been afraid to make some bold, and often brutal, decisions. He dropped Cristiano Ronaldo, ostracised Jadon Sancho and let David de Gea disappear into the void, all in the name of improving the side, as well as the harmony within the squad.",
      "But it isn't just the big names who have fallen foul of the Dutchman's ruthlessness. Just a few weeks after taking over, he reportedly axed five stars from the senior dressing room to free up space for the players he'd brought in that summer.",
      "Phil Jones, Brandon Williams, Axel Tuanzebe, Tegen Mengi and Shola Shoretire were allegedly all ordered to train, eat and change with the academy squad, a move which, unsurprisingly, pushed most of them towards the door. Jones was the first to leave in May 2023 and decided to hang up his boots on his way at just 31.",
      "Mengi, now 22, followed suit a few months later, joining newly-promoted Luton Town, and a week after that Tuanzebe, 26 was gone too, with the defender signing for Ipswich Town.",
      "It left just Williams, 23, and Shoretire, 20, as the only two axed first-teamers left. But last month, two became one, with Williams departing following the expiration of his contract.",
      "Shoretire, 20, won't be far behind, having grown frustrated with his lack of first-team opportunities at the club. He reportedly has a contract offer from United on the table but isn't expected to sign it.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "Any hopes he might have had that Ten Hag would be replaced this summer have now been extinguished following Thursday's news that the former Ajax has signed a new deal at the club. The 54-year-old was expected to quit or be sacked after a dismal season in which United lost 19 times in all competitions, but beating Manchester City in the FA Cup provided something of a silver lining for the campaign.",
      "It marked the second trophy win for the Red Devils in as many seasons, a feat they hadn't achieved since winning the FA Cup in 2015/16, followed by the Europa League and League Cup in 2016/17.",

      "Manchester United have overhauled their recruitment department and that is now set to pay dividends as the Red Devils close in on signing Slovakian wonderkid Samuel Lusale",
      "Manchester United are closing on the signing of Slovakian wonderkid Samuel Lusale.",
      "Lusale is currently on the books of Crystal Palace, having joined the Eagles three years ago. The 16-year-old impressed enough for Palace's Under-18s side to earn a call-up to the Under-17s Euros in May.",
      "He played in all three group games at the tournament, though Slovakia finished bottom of their group. Lusale mainly played in the Under-18s Premier League, helping Palace to finish sixth in the South Division.",
      "His performances have clearly caught the eye of United, who are now working hard to bring him to Old Trafford. The teenager is already represented by Roc Nation, the talent group founded by Jay-Z.",
      "According to the Manchester Evening News, United are 'close' to adding Lusale to their youth team. English teams are restricted in their recruitment at academy level by Brexit regulations which prohibit them from signing players under the age of 18 from overseas clubs.",
      "It appears that United will have a wonderkid on their hands if they do complete the deal for Lusale. Roc Nation’s Global director of football recruitment, Nathan Campbell: “Samuel is a very exciting attacking player who has an abundance of ability.",
      "“He's a late developer, having come into the academy system at a later age, but it's so exciting to contemplate the incredible heights he can reach as he matures both physically and technically.”",
      "Signing Lusale would certainly fit into controlling co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's vision for United's future recruitment. Back in February, he made it clear that the academy would be a key part of his plans for the future.",
      "“Recruitment in the modern game is critical. Manchester United have clearly spent a lot of money but they haven’t done as well as some other clubs. So when I was talking about being best in class in all aspects of football, recruitment is clearly top of the list,” he said.",
      "“We’re probably still debating what precisely is the style of football we want to play. If you look at Manchester City, they know precisely what the style of football is they want to play and all 11 teams at the club play the same formula.",
      "\"We need to do that, but I think in terms of the nature of the players, you want Manchester United types of players: attacking football, exciting football, bringing the youth through. You want players that are committed.",
      "\"You want players that play 90 minutes — those are the types of players you want playing for Manchester United. The academy is really, really important for us. It’s probably the most successful academy in football in terms of number of players that have come through.",
      "“We’ll decide that style, plus the CEO, sporting director, probably the recruitment guys, what the style of football is and that will be the Manchester United style of football, and the coach will have to play that style. In modern football, you need to decide what’s your path and stick to your path.”",

United conducted an end-of-season review and talked to other candidates to replace Ten Hag, but ultimately decided to stick with the 54-year-old Dutchman.",

      "Star forward Paul Mullin will be sidelined for the start of Wrexham's domestic campaign for a second-straight season after undergoing spinal surgery last month",
      "Wrexham striker Paul Mullin will miss the start of the League One season after undergoing a \"minor spinal surgery.\" The 11-year English football veteran had the procedure performed in London last week, hoping to remedy longstanding issues in his hamstring and lower back.",
      "\"The club's three-time, back-to-back top scorer and player of the season has managed the injury through conservative treatment following three years of concern,\" Wrexham said in a statement. \"However, during off-season training it became evident that this approach would not be able to continue and, following several consultations, it was determined that surgery would be the best way forward.\"",
      "Mullin was raised in Litherland, a suburban community north of Liverpool's city centre, and spent time at the academies of Everton and Liverpool before signing his first professional contract with Huddersfield Town in 2013. The forward turned in a modest goal return with Morecambe and bounced around the lower levels of the Football League before a breakout loan stint at League Two Cambridge United.",
      "After signing with Wrexham in 2021, Mullin became the talisman of Rob McElhenny and Ryan Reynolds ' revitalization of the club. Mullin was National League Player of the Year that season and helped the Dragons achieve successive promotions in 2022-23, scoring 88 goals in 128 appearances.",
      "The fourth-year Wrexham man's injury also rules him out of Wrexham's preseason tour in the United States, where Mullin suffered a punctured lung against Manchester United and missed six weeks of action. This season's exhibition circuit, dubbed the \"Wrex Coast Tour 2024\" takes the Dragons to California for matchups against AFC Bournemouth (Santa Barbara) and Chelsea FC (Santa Clara) before heading north of the border to face Vancouver Whitecaps at BC Place.",
      "\"Last year’s US Tour was a fantastic experience, and a memorable trip for all the players and staff,\" said Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson. \"After another successful campaign, we’re delighted to be heading to the West Coast again this summer, and we’re also looking forward to venturing up to Vancouver and spreading the Club’s footprint into Canada. It will be a great chance to meet new supporters, while also building for the 2024/25 League One season.\"",
      "This summer also presents the Wrexham women's team to enjoy a high-profile American showcase. The Lady Dragons will play both SoCal FC and Tigres Femenil U19 at UCLA's Drake Stadium before playing a Portland Thorns Academy squad in Rose City. The revitalization of Wrexham's women's program was a priority for McElhenny and Reynolds, earning promotion to the top-flight of Welsh football and setting the nation's all-time domestic football attendance record at nearly 10,000.",
      "\"Our focus on elevating women's sports makes Ally the perfect teammate to bring Wrexham AFC Women to the U.S. for the first time,\" said Andrea Brimmer, chief Marketing and Public Relations officer, Ally. \"The Wrex Coast Tour gives them the stage they have rightfully earned by capturing hearts with their stories and brilliant play.\""

Of course I am grateful to Erik for this opportunity, but it is not about us knowing each other well. We just have to do good work. Erik has a role in mind for me, we discussed that.

      "Erik ten Hag's situation remains unchanged. He is on the same contract he signed to take over as United manager in April 2022.",
      "Initially, United were unable to confirm whether they had triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract or just extended his contract. Eventually, a source clarified the one-year option had been exercised.",

      "Speaking to Poker Sites, former United striker Teddy Sheringham has urged Ten Hag to stick by Rashford and help him regain the self belief which made him a formidable threat for opposition previously.",
      "I think the issue with Marcus Rashford lies with Erik ten Hag getting the best out of him on a regular basis. He’s obviously not in the England squad because his form hasn’t been good enough. We all know he can do it, but when you’re playing for a top club or national side, you need to produce every time you put the shirt on. At the moment, he’s not been performing well enough and his body language looks completely different to how it did 12 months ago. He needs to get back to those levels and start dragging his team forward like he was doing last season. He’s still only 26 and has a lot of time to turn things round.",
      "It is no secret that Rashford did not perform to his fluent best last season and Ten Hag was adamant that the winger knew why he had not hit the heights of 2022/23.",
      "He knows, I know. It has to do with himself but also to do of course with the team. I already said our attacking game has improved a lot after the winter. But before winter our attacking game was not good enough. I think it's always the two factors I mentioned; it's the team and it's himself. They are of course related to each other.",

      "Amid reports that United are willing to sell Rashford this summer, MEN Sport reported a couple of days ago that the Reds' preference would be to keep the winger this summer.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "It's fair to say that when Ineos and Erik ten Hag opened talks over a new contract for the Manchester United boss, this wasn't the outcome that was initially envisioned. If the plan had always been to simply take the option in the Dutchman's contract, they would have done so while they sat around the sun loungers in Ibiza.",
      "What happened between now and then to lead us to this position is unclear. What is clear is that United wanted to sell this as a contract being extended. Perhaps it's semantics, but in reality, what has happened is a formality that was available to them the moment Ten Hag signed his first contract in 2022.",
      "He remains on the same financial package he was already on, maintains his transfer veto and is still listed as the club's manager. Nothing has really changed at all.",
      "This decision does at least provide some clarity. There would have been a desire on all sides to have an agreement before pre-season training on Monday and if the outcome was only ever leading to the one-year extension being activated, then that is clearly the best option.",
      "From what both camps had indicated after their Ibiza summit on June 11, this wasn't the expected outcome. It still provides clarity, however. Ten Hag now has two years left on his deal and he has had at least a show of some support from Ineos, even if it is not the kind of deal he might have expected.",
      "Ten Hag and new sporting director Dan Ashworth did at least sing from the same hymn sheet during their comments on the extension. In particular, Ten Hag mixed his pride at two trophies in two seasons with an acceptance that things can get better. He also offered encouraging words about the new structure he is working under at United.",
      "\"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together,\" he said.",
      "'Complete unity,' that has to be taken as a positive. Ten Hag's powerbase has diminished at Old Trafford and it could shrink further if he loses long-term assistant Mitchell van der Gaag, who could seek a managerial role of his own if Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake are appointed.",
      "The key to Ten Hag proving he is worthy of more than just a one-year option on his contract will be how his relationships with the key figures appointed by Ineos develop. He has already had plenty of discussion time with the company's head of sport Sir Dave Brailsford and has been working closely with technical director Jason Wilcox.",
      "Now Ten Hag has to co-exist with the most powerful figure in the football structure, the recently-appointed Ashworth who started work this week, as well as forging a relationship with chief executive Omar Berrada, who starts a week on Saturday. The rest of July and August and the success or otherwise of the transfer window will be the first step on the road to making sure that the unity on show at the moment survives into the season.",
      "Then it is down to Ten Hag to deliver. If he gets the signings he wants this summer, results must follow. Ashworth's comment about needing more consistency highlighted the club's standing. Days like the FA Cup final indicated the potential within United with Ten Hag in charge.",
      "Now, more days like that must follow. If they do then the key figures at United will be signing from the same hymn sheet for a little longer yet.",

      "Erik ten Hag has signed a new contract at Manchester United until 2026 and the Dutchman has plenty of work to do to ensure his side have a better season than they did last time out",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Erik ten Hag has penned a new contract with Manchester United, which means he can start addressing the club's many problems.",
      "Following the club's worst Premier League season in history, Ten Hag has a monumental task ahead of him to pull United out of the slump they've been mired in over the past year. His team finished a staggering 31 points behind champions Manchester City in eighth place and suffered 19 defeats across all competitions.",
      "The victory in last month's FA Cup final, along with the performance that accompanied it, provided a much-needed lift after nine months of relentless negativity. Though it wasn't sufficient enough to erase the memory of their disastrous season.",
      "As such, the coming months could prove pivotal for the Dutch manager. With this in mind, here are five key issues Ten Hag must address promptly following his contract extension at Old Trafford to ensure smooth sailing next season.",
      "First and foremost, Ten Hag must tackle the elephant in the room: Sir Jim Ratcliffe isn't exactly his biggest fan. Almost immediately after the billionaire's minority stake in the club was confirmed earlier this year, rumours began circulating that he was considering potential replacements for the Dutchman.",
      "Following the end of the season, the club spent a few weeks in discussions with other managers, including ex-Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, before ultimately deciding to stick with the former Ajax boss. So brazenly speaking to other coaches suggests that Ten Hag could be on thin ice should United hit another rough patch, so he needs to move quickly to prove his worth to Ratcliffe.",
      "There are numerous gaps in United's squad that need addressing, particularly in defence and midfield. The club has been actively seeking a new centre-back, with Matthijs de Ligt, Jarrad Branthwaite and Marc Guehi all being considered, and they are also strongly linked with PSG midfielder Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Securing two or three top-quality players this summer could make the difference between a strong start to the season and a lacklustre one, so prioritising these transfers is crucial for Ten Hag.",
      "Likewise, resolving the futures of players such as Jadon Sancho, Casemiro and Harry Maguire needs to be done promptly, as all three are rumoured to be facing the exit.",
      "Sancho's issues with Ten Hag are well known, and failing to either offload or reconcile with the Englishman could lead to serious problems. Meanwhile, if United sign new players in their positions, high earners Casemiro and Maguire will need to be moved on.",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "Despite the FA Cup victory, the atmosphere at Old Trafford is currently quite bleak. Confidence seems to be at an all-time low, not just among the players but also the fans, and it's a problem Ten Hag needs to tackle swiftly.",
      "To exorcise the demons of the previous season will require significant effort, including a robust and positive pre-season as well as strategic signings and departures. This could potentially reinvigorate the team and restore some faith.",
      "If Ten Hag can get the squad performing at their peak, he'll quickly regain the support of the fans and crucially, of Ratcliffe.",
      "Marcus Rashford's performance last season was worrisome. The 26-year-old only managed to score just eight goals in all competitions, with a mere two before Christmas.",
      "Considering he scored 30 goals the previous season, it's clear how important it is to bring out his best and how much United's season could depend on which version of Rashford shows up for the campaign next month. If Ten Hag can transform Rashford from a purple patch player into a consistently decisive one he'll be on easy street - and it'll take some pressure off Rasmus Hojlund too!",
      "United were hit with 60 different injuries last season, with key players such as Varane, Hojlund, Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Luke Shaw and Casemiro sidelined for extended periods. This disrupted the team's rhythm significantly and Ten Hag must do everything in his power to avoid a repeat.",
      "Whether that involves adjusting training methods, relying more heavily on the medical team, or allowing for longer recovery times - reportedly an issue last season - it's something Ten Hag should seriously consider.",

      "Romelu Lukaku has been linked with a shock return to Manchester United as Erik ten Hag tries to add another centre forward to his squad this summer",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United? Surely not again. Well, rumours circulated earlier this week suggesting that the Red Devils are considering a shock move for the Chelsea forward as a potential alternative to Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "According to Calciomercato, United would consider a surprise switch to bring Lukaku back to Old Trafford this summer if they cannot get a deal for Zirkzee completed. United are keen to add another centre forward to their squad and have identified Zirkzee, who scored 12 goals in 37 matches for Bologna last season, as a priority target. The 23-year-old has a £34million release clause in his contract.",
      "United are pushing to try and get a deal done for the Netherlands international, with Arsenal, AC Milan, and Juventus among his other potential suitors. However, should United fail to sign Zirkzee, then Lukaku has reportedly emerged as another possible striker target - five years since leaving the club. The 31-year-old spent two years at United, scoring 42 goals in 96 matches.",
      "Lukaku is currently employed by Chelsea but hasn't played a single minute for the Blues since 2022, having spent the last two years on loan at Inter Milan and Roma. He made the £97.5m switch to Stamford Bridge in August 2021 but failed to impress in his debut season, despite scoring 15 goals in 44 matches.",
      "A fractured relationship with boss Thomas Tuchel saw Lukaku move to Inter on loan in June 2022. He scored 14 times in 37 appearances while back at the San Siro before signing for Jose Mourinho's Roma last summer, again in a season-long loan deal. Lukaku excelled at the I Giallorossi, hitting 21 goals in 47 games. That return has seen Lukaku gain significant interest, with Chelsea prepared to sell him this summer.",
      "If reports are true, United could be in line to bring back the Belgium international to the club. However, Erik ten Hag should simply avoid going back to sign Lukaku. At 31, he doesn't have age on his side anymore and may only have a couple of years left in him at the very top level.",
      "As a short-term option, I could see why United might look at Lukaku, but they should be looking at the long-term and trying to recruit someone younger who has more potential. Bringing in Rasmus Hojlund, who was 20 at the time, felt like the right type of signing for United. And having another youthful prospect to battle alongside him for the first-choice striker berth could work wonders.",
      "Lukaku would not be happy playing second fiddle or sitting on the bench for a vast majority of the season if he were to join United and be behind Hojlund, who is clearly going to be first-choice. There have been assumptions that Ten Hag could change formation and use two strikers up front next season, but even then, Alejandro Garnacho or Marcus Rashford could be one of those.",
      "So, instead, United should sign someone who is content with potentially being second-choice for the best-part, as well as chipping in when needed. Jonathan David, Ivan Toney and Victor Osimhen are among the other strikers to be linked with a move to the Reds this summer.",

      "Manchester United have been told that centre-back Matthijs de Ligt will only let them negotiate with him this summer as he plans an exit from Bayern Munich.",
      "The Dutch international has fallen down the pecking order at the Allianz Arena, with Bayern having recently hired Vincent Kompany to replace Thomas Tuchel, who only started De Ligt 16 times in the Bundesliga last season. Despite the managerial change, it seems clear that De Ligt sees United as his only option to secure regular minutes.",
      "United's defensive line is an area in desperate need of an upgrade given the number of injuries they suffered in that area last season, as well as the departure of Raphael Varane, who ended his three-year stint at Old Trafford in May following the expiration of his contract.",
      "Speaking on his Transfer Show, journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed: \"Matthijs de Ligt has told his agent, Rafaela Pimenta, already one week ago that the only club allowed to be in negotiations with him, with his camp, with his agent, is Manchester United.",
      "\"Matthijs de Ligt wants to give priority to Manchester United and he wants to go to Manchester United,\" Romano continued.",
      "\"At Bayern, he is not a regular starter. With the Dutch national team, he is not a regular starter and de Ligt wants to play on a regular basis. De Ligt wants to find a top club where he can be trusted 100%. De Ligt knows that, at Manchester United, there is Erik ten Hag, who has been in communication with De Ligt.\"",
      "Elsewhere, United are also reportedly interested in Tottenham Hotspur starlet Mikey Moore, rivalling Manchester City for the youngster's signature. Moore has scored 10 goals in just 12 appearances for England’s under-17s, on top of 22 goal contributions in 12 appearances for Spurs' under-18s last season.",
      "The 16-year-old is still yet to sign a professional contract with the north London club, but will no doubt do so when he turns 17 next month, although it's believed both United and City have already sent the striker a professional contract of their own.",
      "According to Football Insider, Spurs are trying everything they can to stop Moore from leaving the club, and Ange Postecoglou is said to want him involved in the first team throughout the upcoming campaign after the level of talent the star has shown.",

      "Manchester United are searching for a defender this summer, with several centre-backs being linked.",
      "In recent days, Matthijs De Ligt has been framed as one option United could plunge for, with reports connecting United with a potential £40m swoop. De Ligt still has three years left on his Bayern contract but might have his head turned by an offer from United, speculation says.",
      "Meanwhile, United are being tipped to bring back former full-back Sergio Reguilon amid their struggles with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. Both have suffered persistent injury problems over the past year, with Malacia not playing all season due to surgery recovery setbacks.",
      "De Ligt has supposedly told agent Rafaela Pimenta that the only club he will consider leaving Bayern for this summer is United. Fabrizio Romano says the player has become slightly unsettled over the fact he is not an assured starter at his club.",
      "The 24-year-old began 16 of his 22 Bundesliga matches last season but was benched multiple times and failed to get onto the pitch on several occasions. De Ligt came through the ranks at Ajax under Ten Hag before his 2019 switch to Juventus, prior to his 2022 move to Bayern.",
      "MEN Sport says: De Ligt would be a great addition to United’s defence, offering Champions League experience and longevity. The quoted £40m fee would be an excellent deal, although it’s arguable that it is perhaps somewhat below what Bayern would hold out for.",
      "If De Ligt’s exclusivity transfer stance regarding United is true, that is a huge bonus for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who will not have the bane of an auction with rival clubs. The obvious ties to Ten Hag would also help in getting a deal over the line.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet AS says United are mulling over whether to bring back Reguilon to cover at left-back. The Spaniard secured a loan spell at Old Trafford from Tottenham last summer but had his deal cut short in January and moved onto Brentford.",
      "Ten Hag said he had been under the impression that Shaw and Malacia were nearing returns in the new year, but both suffered setbacks in recovery. Reguilon has one year left on his Tottenham deal, with a sale this summer likely.",
      "MEN Sport says: It is understandable why United might look at Reguilon again. He did not excite, but he did do an ample defensive job at full-back during his spell last season, which clearly ended prematurely.",
      "Given he has just a year left on his deal, Reguilon might be available on a cut price deal. His return would rest on the fitness levels of Shaw and Malacia, which fans would expect to be back to full capacity by the time the new season comes around. But they will not be holding their breath.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has given a bleak assessment of Cristiano Ronaldo's performances for Portugal at Euro 2024",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Rene Meulensteen has delivered a blunt assessment of Cristiano Ronaldo's performances for Portugal in Euro 2024.",
      "Meulensteen, an ex-Manchester United first-team coach and confidant to Sir Alex Ferguson, who worked with Ronaldo at Old Trafford, gave his thoughts during an appearance on talkSPORT. The Dutchman expressed concern over Ronaldo's free-kick record and suggested that Portugal manager Roberto Martinez needs to tackle the issue.",
      "He also pointed out that the game seems to be slipping away from the veteran footballer, reports the Mirror. During the interview, talkSPORT co-host Alex Crooks questioned Meulensteen about Ronaldo's impact on the national team:",
      "Crook asked: \"Are they a better team without him in it, Portugal? He takes every free kick, blazes every free kick into the stands.\"",
      "Meulensteen acknowledged the need for a change, saying: \"Yeah well, that to me is something I think that needs to be addressed because the stats don't help.\"",
      "Meulensteen also touched upon Ronaldo's emotional reaction during the round of 16 match against Slovenia, where he was visibly upset after his penalty was saved by Jan Oblak but later scored in the shoot-out.",
      "Reflecting on the situation, Meulensteen remarked: \"Well, it's all about perception isn't it? First of all, I thought when that penalty shoot-out came about, I thought this is going to be interesting because he's only going to take one or another penalty he's either the first one or number five, the last one.",
      "\"And I was pleasantly surprised for him to step up and take the first one because he knew, 'I need to take the responsibility, I need to put this right to get us off of the wrong foot'. So that to me was a good sign of character.\"",
      "Meulensteen added: \"What happened after the game showed his determination and his desire to win things and to do well that is so strong. He's got the highest expectations of himself and everybody around him. He expects the highest standards of himself and everybody else, and if he doesn't meet those standards - which he didn't - then obviously you get that reaction from him.\"",
      "Meulensteen also highlighted that Ronaldo needs to justify any claim to taking free-kicks for Portugal by improving his success rate.",
      "He explained: \"The only way to justify it [taking free kicks] is to put one in the top corner and that is obviously what he's got in his mind but the stats don't back that up and the thing is, you know with every team normally, you've got a clear plan with everything in terms of the corners, who takes them and the free kicks and this and that and the other.",
      "\"He sees them [free kicks] as an opportunity but it's not working and I think it's the manager's job to address that.\"",
      "Jim White, formerly of Sky Sports Transfer Deadline Day, put the question to Meulensteen regarding whether he'd include Ronaldo in Portugal's starting line-up for their upcoming match against France on Friday night. White queried: \"If you were Martinez, I'm going to do it, I'm going to put you in that spot, would you play him in this game against the French on Friday, would you start him?\"",
      "Meulensteen replied: \"Yeah, I would start him, yeah I would.\"",
      "White then asked if Meulensteen would give any specific pre-match instructions, to which Meulensteen replied: \"I would probably have a clear conversation with him then with the leadership group and also in the tactical way that we, if we think we're going to beat France then I expect something different from you, from you, from you and from you.\"",
      "He added: \"And the only way we can do that is if we pull together and let everybody play to their strength, so therefore this is how we're going to do it.\"",

      "The blond-haired Bayern Munich defender Manchester United should be making a beeline for is Joshua Kimmich, not Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "United will have glanced at Kimmich. He is out of contract at Bayern next year and the noise coming out of Bavaria suggests he is available. Perhaps Kimmich is bound for Barcelona, where his former coach Hansi Flick has replaced Xavi.",
      "Before Sir Jim Ratcliffe surfaced in the Old Trafford directors' box, United were tracking prospective targets due to have a year left on their contract this summer. Ratcliffe has namechecked the Transfermarkt website and Kimmich is listed as the 11th most-expensive player out of contract next year.",
      "Transfermarkt's numbers are as infamous as they are inexplicable. Scott McTominay, the subject of a rejected £30m offer by West Ham last year before he had a career-best season, is listed at £27m. De Ligt, a substitute for club and country, is valued at €65m when United have been quoted €15m less. Kimmich is rated at €50m.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: United set to sign Slovakia winger",
      "As a final fee, that would be reasonable for a 29-year-old with plenty of mileage left. Kimmich is a better right back than the two at United and an upgrade on their senior midfielders.",
      "He is nine years Kobbie Mainoo's senior and would be a worthy partner. Stolen from RB Leipzig for €7m when he was only 20 in 2015, Kimmich has a pedigree befitting a Bayern and Germany stalwart: enough medals to warrant an extension for a trophy room and ten appearances short of becoming a centurion for Die Mannschaft.",
      "United and Bayern share a close bond through the Munich air disaster and Bayern delegates continue to visit the Manchesterplatz site on February 6. The clubs have arranged three legends matches in the past decade and Sir Alex Ferguson has rhapsodized about Bayern's identity and structure.",
      "There have been only three player trades between the clubs and they have all gone to United: Owen Hargreaves and Bastian Schweinsteiger permanently, and Marcel Sabitzer on loan.",
      "Uli Hoeness accused Hargreaves of \"prostituting\" himself amid United's efforts to sign him in 2006. The move eventually went through the next summer.",
      "Louis van Gaal reunited with Schweinsteiger but also wanted Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller. Ed Woodward was so bruised by the failure of Schweinsteiger in 2015 he gave Jerome Boateng short shrift three years later.",
      "Amid the scramble for a centre back in the final week of that fraught summer transfer window, Boateng was suggested as a possibility, only civil war was brewing at United. They was no director of communications, Woodward seemed to be avoiding Jose Mourinho and messages were mixed. Anthony Martial was not for sale in Woodward's eyes but he was in Mourinho's.",
      "Boateng was swiftly discounted by Woodward, who cited United's track record of signing crocks from Bayern. Boateng had missed 23 of Bayern's games the previous season and that was a stark enough red flag for Woodward to veto a move. Boateng would go on to start in Bayern's victorious Champions League final in 2020.",
      "The age profile of United's targets this summer has been in the early 20s. United idealistically targeted players of a similar age in the 2019 summer window, ended it two targets short, suffered key injuries to Luke Shaw, Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba in August and were suddenly exposed.",
      "In the listless 1-0 loss at Newcastle in early October, three starters were aged 21, one was 20 and another 22, while four teenagers were on the bench. Without the mid-season arrival of the 25-year-old Bruno Fernandes, United were destined to finish outside of the top four.",
      "United have two poster boys in Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, who turned 20 on Monday, while there is potential in the callow Rasmus Hojlund. The man United want to support Hojlund - Joshua Zirkzee - is another early-20s striker in Italy with a modest goalscoring record.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, the scorers in the FA Cup final, kept the red flag flying high in a draining season. Their exceptional starts in the first team are all the more laudable as they entered a dressing room devoid of an established leadership group. Cristiano Ronaldo was surrounded by serial winners Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs in 2003. Ruud van Nistelrooy merits mention in the same breath.",
      "Ronaldo, Casemiro and Raphael Varane shared the same four walls for a few months in 2022 but two have gone and the other could be going. In the unlikely event Fernandes were to go, there is not an obvious replacement to assume the captaincy as there was when Harry Maguire was stripped of it last year.",
      "Kimmich has captained Bayern and Germany countless times. He is a year younger than Schweinsteiger when he became United's \"first Kraut\" (his words) but Schweinsteiger, already greying, looked older and the wear and tear started to take its toll. He did not start another Premier League game in his last 14 months at United.",
      "Kimmich's longest lay-off was 14 games and that was before he joined Bayern. He has missed a mere 34 Bayern matches in nine seasons.",
      "De Ligt has missed as many in just over a third of that time.",

      "Initially, United were unable to confirm whether they had triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract or just extended his contract. Eventually, a source clarified the one-year option had been exercised.",
      "That is a crucial difference. Whatever Ten Hag's requests or demands under the new co-owner, they are not contractual.",
      "When Ten Hag spoke to Dutch broadcaster NOS last month, he said: \"We had a good talk and various topics were discussed and the conclusion was that we will continue with each other but also the conclusion is that we are going to sit down to renew the contract.\"",
      "EXCLUSIVE: United set to sign Slovakia winger",

      "But it is also sensible. Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were sacked in the same year they signed completely new contracts. United have moved on from Ed Woodward's gullible ways.",
      "It still feels like an uneasy alliance and effectively extends Ten Hag's trial period. United will have their three \"pillars\" - Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox - in place to judge him next season.",
      "Ashworth said: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.",

With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"",
      "That struck a diplomatic but defiant tone. United have a nucleus to build a new squad around, Ten Hag's standout victories have come against the elite (Liverpool in August 2022, Barcelona in February 2023 and City in May 2024), the academy secured a triple-crown last term and Ten Hag is a great champion of United's youth identity.",
      "United have implemented their new structure quickly and the aforementioned trio are duty bound to support the manager who has chiselled two years onto an honours board that was unchanged for nearly six years. United now have to be proactive with signings and sales.",
      "Ten Hag will soon be supported by compatriots on the coaching staff in Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake. Ten Hag is a stickler for the familiar and/or the Dutch, though the seniority of the support raises questions.",

Right the way down to the period of time that the new ownership groups had been in charge, the similarities are there.",
      "Unlike many of these deals, though, it is not because of the work Vivell did at Stamford Bridge that he is being targeted by United as a short-term director. According to The Athletic, the German is being courted as a possible summer arrival to help oversee the summer window.",
      "It comes at the same time that Dan Ashworth has finally seen his move to Old Trafford confirmed. Chief executive Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are the other names in the backroom team that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos group are putting in place.",
      "But Vivell is not, it appears, part of the long-term plans for the furniture at United. That doesn't mean he can't have an impact.",
      "Vivell's track record to date is impressive. He headed the work in scouting, coordination, and squad planning in the much revered Red Bull success stories Salzburg and Leipzig. Before that he impressed in roles at Hoffenheim, where he worked with Julian Nagelsmann. And then there's his brief period at Chelsea.",
      "The only full transfer window he was involved at in London was mixed, to say the least. For Malo Gusto there is Mykhailo Mudryk. If Benoit Badaishile is seen as a good piece of business, then Noni Madueke splits opinion. It may have only been on paper but Vivell was theoretically one of the leading parts of the team at Chelsea when they went deep into deadline day in January 2023 to break the British transfer record for Enzo Fernandez.",
      "That came just six months after he had moved to Benfica for ten times less. He is yet to show why that level of outlay was spent. Christopher Nkunku is a fine player but by the time Vivell was in charge it was already largely in place for him to join Chelsea. There was £300million spent that winter with Vivell involved.",
      "One window later and he was on gardening leave. Chelsea had made Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart - both with impressive CVs but in differing circumstances - the real heads for their new model. Vivell was out before he even settled.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "There have been suggestions that he was disenfranchised with the way the structure was working. Too many cooks spoil the broth, or so they say. It was a concern at the time when Chelsea hired four new directors into a team, each with their own targets and ideas.",
      "Vivell was never the key man at Chelsea. He was perhaps the most noteworthy but was not the director who became a household name or made the biggest impact. Instead, it was co-owner Behdad Eghbali and Winstanley who went on to run the roost.",
      "United certainly won't be able to say that they don't know how Vivell likes to work. And frankly, why wouldn't they like what he has to offer?",
      "Vivell boasts a strong array of players signed at Leipzig and Salzburg. Dominik Szoboszlai, Erling Haaland, and Benjamin Sesko are just a few. Josko Gvardiol, Timo Werner, and Mohamed Simakan are others.",
      "United will be less interested by the sales he managed to achieve but they are just as impressive with Dayot Upamecano, Naby Keita, Ibrahima Konate, and Tyler Adams all leaving for significant fees under his watch. Nagelsmann was allowed to thrive as a head coach within the environment that he helped to create.",
      "This is all idyllic for United. How much of this can Vivell help to implement in a matter of months? It's hard to know. Advisors, as he may well effectively be, are extremely useful though, and with other new important figures waiting to get themselves going at Carrington, or else with plans to look beyond the first realistic chance for Ratcliffe and co to get down to action, Vivell could be a smart appointment himself.",
      "The big question for United, and for Vivell, is just what sort of control he will be given. When it comes to building squads for a defined style of play he is one of the most established in the world, but as Chelsea witnessed in a fashion not too far from United's current situation, leaving the waters muddy will benefit nobody.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "There is a new technical director, an inaugural sporting director and another sporting director on the board who is assisted by a sport project manager. Yet Manchester United continue to target players who are Dutch, or have played for Ajax, or for the manager.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt ticks all three boxes. Five years ago, the 19-year-old De Ligt was the nascent centre back in world football after Ajax's domestic double and captivating run to the Champions League semi-final.",
      "United did not discourage their interest in De Ligt but he was never a realistic target as they were in the Europa League. United are back in the Europa next season. That De Ligt is receptive to joining Europa United tells you all you need to know about his decline.",
      "De Ligt danced to the tune of his agent, the late Mino Raiola, and joined Juventus in 2019. That never seemed like a snug fit and he was sold to Bayern Munich after three years.",
      "At Bayern last season, De Ligt started a paltry 23 games. He has not had a kick at the European Championship in an admittedly impressive Dutch defence. De Ligt played one minute at the 2022 World Cup.",
      "United sounded out Thomas Tuchel, De Ligt's manager last season, only last month. Had they replaced Erik ten Hag with Tuchel they would not be starying anywhere near De Ligt.",
      "United have a long history with De Ligt. He was 11 when he started for Ajax's under 13s against United in the warm-up act to Edwin van der Sar's testimonial at the Amsterdam Arena back in 2011. De Ligt was the daring yet dithering defender pickpocketed to set a United whippersnapper on his way to get the equalising goal. The whippersnapper was Callum Gribbin.",
      "Four years before De Ligt transferred to Juventus for £68m, he was recommended by the United head of youth recruitment Derek Langley. United compiled innumerable scouting reports but the hierarchy vetoed a move.",
      "In a heated exchange with Ed Woodward, Langley questioned the competency of those running the club. Seven months later, Langley was gone.",
      "United's emotionally-charged Europa League final triumph over Ajax in 2017 was such an uncompetitive contest as they neutered De Ligt. United players were instructed to press De Ligt, identified as a dexterous distributor, but stand off his partner at centre back, Davinson Sanchez, whenever he had the ball. The more limited Sanchez hoiked the ball into United territory, where Marouane Fellaini was head and shoulders above all in the aerial duels.",
      "When Jose Mourinho took over at Tottenham, he could not resist reminding Sanchez of the occasion. Mourinho asked Sanchez if he had \"balls\" as Ajax \"s**t themselves\" in the final. \"I won the game minute one,\" Mourinho bragged.",
      "Before De Ligt's breakthrough performances in the Champions League, Mourinho suggested him as a possible reinforcement. Marcel Bout, the head of global scouting and only surviving member of Louis van Gaal's staff, expressed concerns about De Ligt's physique on account of his reputedly rotund father.",
      "All three of Ten Hag's blond bombshells at Ajax have endured difficulties away from the Amster. De Ligt has become a substitute for club and country, Barcelona accepted an offer from United for Frenkie de Jong two years ago and Donny van de Beek will be released next year if he is not sold this year.",
      "Ten Hag backs himself to revive De Ligt but his prospective signing would be based on form five years ago rather than form in the last five years. De Ligt has not been a success in Serie A or the Bundesliga, yet is deemed suitable for the more taxing Premier League at the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "Compatriots Virgil van Dijk, Nathan Ake and Micky van de Ven are among the outstanding defenders in England. Van Dijk moved to Britain when he was 21 and Ake joined Chelsea's academy at the age of 16. Van de Ven was a stellar piece of business by Tottenham last year.",
      "De Ligt is still only 24 and far from a write-off. He offers longevity, is familiar with the manager's methods and has good pedigree at club and international level. De Ligt has competed in more Champions League semi-finals than United have in 15 years and his attributes represent an upgrade on the potentially outgoing Victor Lindelof, if not Raphael Varane.",
      "Perhaps it is an unfortunate coincidence Juventus and Bayern's dominance eroded shortly after they signed De Ligt. Juve have not won the Scudetto since De Ligt's first season and Bayern's Bundesliga hegemony ended in his second.",
      "And maybe it is rotten luck De Ligt was red-carded in the Netherlands' round-of-16 elimination by the Czech Republic at Euro 2020 before they reached successive quarter-finals with him on the bench in Germany and Qatar.",
      "There are five former Ajax players in the current United squad and four arrived under Ten Hag. Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount played in the Eredivisie while Rasmus Hojlund and Sofyan Amrabat's representation was taken over by Dutchman Kees Vos, Ten Hag's agent, before their transfers.",
      "Louis van Gaal's rebranding of Barcelona in the Nineties was so Dutchcentric the away kit should have been turned orange. Van Gaal brought in Ruud Hesp, Frank and Ronald de Boer, Michael Reiziger, Phillip Cocu, Winston Bogarde, Patrick Kluivert and Boudewijn Zenden within a three-year period. Barca have not bought that many Dutchmen in the 24 years since Van Gaal offered his amigos de la prensa their congratulations on sacking him.",
      "De Ligt did not get onto the pitch against United in the Allianz Arena last year until full-time when he offered Andre Onana a sympathetic embrace. He was injured for the return match in Manchester.",
      "United, eighth and almost as close to champions Manchester City as relegated Luton Town points-wise, and De Ligt could go hand in glove. They are two fading forces with points to prove.",
      "Langley also endorsed a move for a teenage De Jong. Ten Hag might welcome his return at United.",

      "\"We all want Matthijs de Ligt to stay at FC Bayern Munich,\" a section titled 'Why this petition matters' reads. \"He has proven that he‘s a world class defender, probably the best in our squad. There is a reason why he was elected as our best player in the 2022/23 season.",
      "\"Furthermore he is only 24 years old and has a bright future ahead, which he is going to use to fulfil his huge potential. Despite his young age, Mattha is already very mature and has a great mentality which will definitely make him a leading figure in defence and probably a competitor for captaincy in some years. His ability to speak English, German and Dutch fluently would help him a lot for that. With 19 years he already brought Ajax Amsterdam to the UCL semi-finals as captain.",

      "If De Ligt was to join from Bayern Munich and Zirkzee from Bologna it would take the number of players of Dutch origin, or who have played in the Eredivisie, to nine, although that includes Donny van de Beek, who is peripheral to this squad at best. It wouldn't exactly give the impression of United moving away from a transfer strategy dictated by the manager.",
      "That is the situation Sir Jim Ratcliffe was keen to avoid when Ineos got the keys to Old Trafford. Speaking in February, he explained his desire to revamp the football structure at the club and get away from a model that hands so much power to the manager.",
      "\"What you need are the foundations to be in a good place for Manchester United to be successful, which means that, from our point of view anyway, you need the right organisational structure,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"Which means not having a coach reporting to the chief executive, for instance, which is what they've got at the moment. You need the right organisation structure and that's not going to be too complicated.\"",
      "That structure is pretty much in place now. Dan Ashworth leads it as the sporting director, reporting to a chief executive, which for now is Jean-Claude Blanc but will be Omar Berrada from July 13. Below Ashworth is technical director Jason Wilcox, while Christopher Vivell is also set to take up a narrower recruitment role.",
      "With Ashworth having started work after an end to four months of negotiations with Newcastle, United can begin to redraw their structure when it comes to decisions around transfers. The idea will be to give Ten Hag less power than he has had in his first two summer windows.",
      "Under the Glazer regime, with a chief executive focused on commercial success in Richard Arnold and football director John Murtough, Ten Hag guided the decision-making and took on a bigger role when it came to transfers, with United restructuring their scouting and recruitment operation.",
      "There have been hits and misses for Ten Hag in the market, but Ashworh has a reputation for shrewd recruitment and will take on a major role, although as sporting director his job is far more wide-reaching than just transfers.

      "\"If I sign a player that Graham [Potter] doesn’t like or want, it’s a drastic waste of resources. Ultimately, Graham has got to pick 11 players that he thinks will give him the best chance of winning,\" Ashworth said.",
      "\"If he doesn’t rate the attributes in a player that I do, then we are going to invest a transfer fee, salary and agent’s fee for a player that Graham doesn’t rate or want and who is unlikely to play.",
      "\"So how do we work here? Well, we agree the areas of the pitch that Graham wants to improve. Our first port of call is 'what have we already got in the system?' There have been times when Graham has said: 'I’d rather work with what we’ve got and make them better than sign a player for the sake of it.'",
      "\"But if we haven’t got that position in the U23s or out on loan then we need to go into the market.\"",
      "Ashworth used the example of Potter wanting a more physical striker and deciding to pursue Danny Welbeck for the role. This summer Ten Hag wants a central defender and a striker as a priority and in the case of De Ligt, there is an obvious connection to use there. He is someone the United manager wants and has a good relationship with.",
      "Ashworth will use his own instincts and contacts as well, however. He did just that when using his time with England and getting to know Tariq Lamptey through the age-group sides. With Reece James blocking his path at Chelsea, he saw the young right-back as a realistic target for Brighton and he has excelled at the Amex.",

United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",

Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",

Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United are threatening to become a serious, well-oiled machine when it comes to transfer recruitment for the men's team.",
      "Having finally landed Newcastle's sporting director, Dan Ashworth, this week, the Reds have also appointed Christopher Vivell to their boardroom on a short-term deal. The 37-year-old will be advising the Ineos regime on player recruitment, having left his role at Chelsea last July.",
      "Much has been made about his ability to unearth talents, with the key name being Manchester City's talisman, Erling Haaland, and the hope will be that the German can do similarly for United this summer. In fact, there is one player who would be ideal for United this summer and whom he has already tapped up previously: Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The catch here is that Sesko has already committed himself to another season in the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig. Considering Vivell's contract is currently short-term, United would have to extend his deal to ensure he can play an impact next summer when the Slovenian international becomes available.",
      "But considering the potential the 21-year-old possesses, it could be well worth United getting all the advantages they can. Arsenal and Chelsea both joined the Reds in their interest in Sesko last summer, but we can guarantee that the number of clubs wanting his signature will only increase if he performs for RB Leipzig next season.",
      "It is understood that a gentleman's agreement is in place between Sesko and Leipzig about him leaving for a bigger club in the near future. United will need to be on their toes if they are going to beat their rivals to him, and Vivell could play a key role in that.",
      "Ultimately, Sesko would be considered a dream signing for Old Trafford's new regime. He ticks the youth box, he ticks the proven goalscorer box, and if you throw in his strength and speed, you have yourself a player with all the attributes to be a success in the Premier League.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos Group have gradually been implementing changes at Old Trafford, with some of the most notable happening in recent days. Dan Ashworth was confirmed as United's new sporting director earlier this week after his exit from Newcastle.",
      "United have also confirmed that Erik ten Hag has signed a new contract with the club. The Reds boss has committed his future at Old Trafford until 2026 and work will already be underway to prepare for next season.",
      "The summer transfer window is open and United have been linked with several potential new signings. Centre-back is a known area of the squad that the Reds are keen to strengthen this summer.",
      "Bayern Munich star Matthijs de Ligt is a target for United but is currently with the Netherlands squad at Euro 2024. Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite is also a player of interest to the Reds.",
      "In midfield, there is also speculation that Benfica star Joao Neves could be a target for United. The Portugal international is reported to have a release clause of over £100 million, with Benfica seemingly unwilling to accept a fee any lower.",
      "In the forward areas, several players have been linked with a move to United. The Bologna striker is one player who could make the switch to Old Trafford, with the Netherlands international having a £34 million release clause in his contract.",
      "There have also been tentative rumours linking Napoli striker Victor Osimhen with a move to United. However, this may be the most unlikely of deals to happen, unless funds were generated through a sale of one of the club's main stars such as Marcus Rashford.",
      "Were United to allow Rashford to leave the club, then it's plausible that a replacement may be found. Osimhen is regarded as one of the most talented strikers in Europe, and the opportunity to sign him may be a dream possibility for United.",
      "When it comes to players already at the club, several are still viewed as vital members of United's squad. Andre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Amad Diallo could all feature in Ten Hag's first-choice starting line-up next season.",

      "After spending up to £70million on Casemiro in August 2022, United swooped for Mason Mount in July last year, signing him in a deal that could eventually be worth up to £60m. With this summer's window now open, they are expected to make it a hat-trick.",
      "Despite the success of his maiden season at Old Trafford, Casemiro rapidly declined last term. He failed to bring the same levels of class and quality that he brought to the table so often in 2022/23.",
      "An omission from United's list of untouchables, it is possible the Brazilian could be sold this summer as Ineos begin the process of making changes to the landscape of the first-team squad. He has frequently been linked with clubs in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ahead of United's players reporting back for the start of pre-season training later this month, manager Erik ten Hag is expected to continue with his preferred 4-3-3 system. It means Kobbie Mainoo and captain Bruno Fernandes are expected to continue as staples in the engine room.",
      "Fernandes is United's architect-in-chief, meaning he will continue to occupy the most advanced midfield role, supported by Mainoo behind him. The latter is developing into a forward-thinking player, capable of pulling the strings and comfortably operating between both boxes.",
      "With Fernandes taking care of attacking matters and Mainoo providing the levels of control Ten Hag has so often been longing for, United need to complete their first-choice midfield by drafting in an elite-level destroyer, who will take care of the dirty side of the game. Casemiro was perfect in the role in 2022/23 but ultimately went backwards last term.",
      "Joao Neves has frequently been linked with succeeding the Brazilian, but Benfica could easily price United out of a move. The Portuguese international's release clause is worth north of £100m, and United do not have a bottomless pit of cash to spend this summer.",
      "The Reds, however, already have a deal on the table that could see them strengthen their defensive-midfield options for around £21m. In addition to signing Mount last summer, United also drafted in Sofyan Amrabat, signing him on a season-long loan from Fiorentina.",
      "United, who have the option to sign the Moroccan permanently for €20m plus €5m in add-ons, needed cover and an element of competition for Casemiro at the base of the engine room.",
      "\"In that position we only had Casemiro who can play really well there,\" said Ten Hag, reflecting on the addition of Amrabat at the time. \"With others we have to make compromises but, with Sofyan Amrabat, we have another one.\"",
      "Despite making 30 appearances over the duration of his loan spell, it was not until the end of the season that the Moroccan started to produce his best levels. He started each of United's last four games, including the FA Cup final, in which he produced an outstanding display to significantly contribute to the Reds' tactical plan to overcome their cross-city rivals.",
      "He shielded the back-four expertly, providing United with the defensive nous they desperately needed in midfield. Up until his mini run of renaissance at the end of the campaign, votes to keep Amrabat beyond the end of his loan spell would have been minimal, whereas now they would be more forthcoming.",
      "With United needing to improve their general level of quality when it comes to squad depth, Amrabat is worth exploring on a permanent deal, with a view to signing him as a back up option. He has already expressed interest in staying in Manchester and United are yet to make a final decision, suggesting they have not dismissed the idea of activating the clause on offer.",
      "Ten Hag has often cited the need for having two players for each position and if Casemiro is to depart this summer, simply signing a direct replacement for him will not suffice. Any new addition would also need cover.",
      "Amrabat, who will turn 28 next month, would be at the heart of a deal United should find relatively easy to get done having already got a price on the table. He would not necessarily be the most exciting signing United could make this summer, but he could rank as one of the most sensible to balance the squad.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Manchester United transfer news with Erik ten Hag and Ineos looking to add a centre-back to their squad this summer and Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt is the latest name linked",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is expected to hot up from now onwards as the Reds enter a new financial year.",
      "United managed to stay within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) last month but that does not mean Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be complacent regarding the money spent on transfers. Ineos will be aiming to find bargains in the transfer market and one name who could feature in that plan is Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "According to reports in Germany, De Ligt's camp has received communication from United regarding a transfer. Sky Deutschland's Florian Plettenberg adding that the Reds are now in contact with Bayern regarding a deal.",
      "With plans appearing to be escalating quickly, MEN Sport has asked its United writers for their opinions on signing De Ligt.",
      "The switch towards De Ligt as a target this summer shows that United are learning their lessons from years gone by. Instead of being embroiled in a back-and-forth with Everton over Jarrad Branthwaite's valuation, the Reds are moving on and seeing what else is out there.",
      "The Toffees are well within their rights to value Branthwaite at £70m+ but if United have already drawn their line in the sand there is no point sitting around hoping that Everton change their mind. De Ligt has the potential to be a solid bit of business if done at the right price.",
      "Ratcliffe will be wary United still need to add a midfielder and striker to their ranks this summer and De Ligt does still constitute a risk. He has not been at the level he was at with Ajax since joining Bayern and the Reds' offer should reflect this.",
      "But, if anyone is going to get the best out of De Ligt again it will be Ten Hag. Vincent Kompany may end up wishing he never sold him.",
      "Juventus thought they had a good deal when they signed De Ligt for €75m. Bayern Munich thought they'd got a steal when they spent €67m to sign him three years later. Now, here we are, two years further down the line and United are being tempted by a €50m asking price. There's a pattern emerging here.",
      "You can understand the temptation to sign De Ligt. On the evidence of his Ajax potential that fee looks a steal but he's struggled in Turin and Munich and is now fourth-choice centre-back for the Netherlands. Micky van de Ven has come on ahead of him in two of the three group games and De Ligt is yet to play a minute.",
      "Maybe rekindling that relationship with Ten Hag will get the best out of him once again, but that is exactly what Ineos said they weren't going to do. Having a manager dictating transfer strategy just isn't a plan for long-term success. If the next manager doesn't want De Ligt then you've got problems.",
      "At the fee quoted, there will be a huge groundswell of support towards signing a player who broke so many records as a teenager. That potential remains unfulfilled, however, and there is a reason he available for €25m less than when he left Ajax five years ago. I'm not sure it's a risk worth taking.",
      "It was not all that long when De Ligt was bracketed as one of the most promising centre-backs in world football. That status earned him a €75m move to Juventus in 2019, just weeks after he had played his part in Ajax's shock run to the Champions League semi-final.",
      "After 117 appearances in the famous black and white stripes, he joined Bayern Munich in 2022 and has made just 73 appearances since, with injuries often disrupting his chances of progressing. He fell down the pecking order last term, impacted by those aforementioned injury troubles, but was still trusted to start the Champions League semi-final second leg defeat to Real Madrid ahead of Kim Min-jae and Dayot Upamecano, who both started on the bench.",
      "Despite Thomas Tuchel never seeming to fully warm to him, rekindling his relationship with Ten Hag could be the secret to getting his career back on track. At the age of 24, there is most definitely time for him to rediscover his best form.",
      "Arguably playing the best football of his career thus far under Ten Hag, reuniting him with his fellow countryman could be just the ticket. His qualities, too, could compliment the skillset of Lisandro Martinez. If United can agree a price that is both reasonable and sensible, he could be the ideal Raphael Varane successor.",
      "Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt spent mere weeks as teammates at Ajax in the summer of 2019, while Andre Onana made over 100 appearances with the then-teenager in front of him for the Dutch club. United backing Erik ten Hag to get the best out of them again at Old Trafford would be a case of doubling down on their transfer policy of recent seasons as the manager approaches this stay-of-execution season at Old Trafford.",
      "De Ligt is also familiar with the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia after playing together with the Netherlands national team. But regardless of whether they rekindle that tandem at Old Trafford after the left back's injury issues, signing De Ligt would see two familiar faces playing ahead of Onana this upcoming season.",
      "Their existing chemistry should allow the team to start the season strong defensively and the central defender to build a partnership with Martinez. The Argentina international has shown an ability to strike up chemistry with Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane and Victor Lindelof since arriving at Old Trafford. De Ligt is arguably more talented than that trio have shown during their time at United, and Martinez may be the man to bring the best out of him.",
      "Signing De Ligt is a calculated risk for United: there is a reason Bayern are willing to sell him. The Dutch international has lost his starting role for both club and country, with injuries seeing him miss 20 games in 2023/24. He also missed 28 matches during the 20/21 season with Juventus. The last player United need to replace the injury-prone Raphael Varane is another unreliable centre-back, but there is also a case to be made that De Ligt is worth the risk.",
      "His talent is undeniable, there are few better centre-backs in European football when he's fit and in form, he played under Erik ten Hag at Ajax and would likely adapt well given he is fluent in English and has played in Italy and Germany already. United also badly need a new, affordable centre-back and are not exactly spoilt for choice: Lille's Leny Yoro looks bound for Real Madrid; Jean-Clair Todibo from Nice is out of bounds due to UEFA restrictions regarding Ineos' stakes in both the French club and United, while Everton have resisted United's initial £35m offer for Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "De Ligt would fit the bill for anything around the £40m mark, provided he's signed on a sensible wage which also makes selling him a realistic prospect. If he joins United and enjoys a successful first season at Old Trafford, he would double that £40m valuation and still only be 24 years old; if not, he will still have a decent resale value and won't have cost the earth. Signing De Ligt is a sensible bet to make at this stage of Ineos' United revolution.",
      "De Ligt would be a seriously good signing for Manchester United. There may well be reservations over how he developed since leaving Ajax but as a leader from his teenage years and with a still large catalogue of evidence to date, the Dutchman is a top player.",
      "Depending on the price of a deal - anything under £50million would be good considering his age and experience - it is certainly one for United to be all over. He could certainly be part of the heart of Ten Hag's defence next season along with fellow former Ajax players Martinez and Malacia.",
      "There are not that many options for the right money out there for United now. They have made their stance clear on Branthwaite and their position is public. Bayern won't be keen to entertain small offers here, but if De Ligt can be convinced to move to England then it's one that could be transformative for United.",
      "Signing De Ligt would be a good move for United - if done at the right price. The fact that Bayern Munich are open to selling him is good news for the club, and should mean that United are not held to ransom over a huge transfer fee.",
      "That could be the case with interest in Everton’s Jarred Branthwaite. The Toffees will be desperate to keep a key player, and will therefore charge a big price.",
      "De Ligt has been in and out of the Bayern team and has reportedly become irritated with the game time he is getting. He will therefore be determined to prove a point wherever he is playing his football in the new season.",
      "The fact that he has previously worked with Erik ten Hag will only be good news too. The Dutchman knows how to get the best out of his former player. If a move does happen, then United fans will be hoping that they see the De Ligt who burst onto the scene at Ajax before his move to Bayern.",

      "Naturally, Manchester United signed him a third of the way through this period. Then a gradual decline became steep.",
      "Mount started once in the Premier League after October 7 and missed 32 of United’s 52 fixtures through injury. When Erik ten Hag confided to those at Carrington that certain players’ defeatist mindset contributed to their injuries, Mount was one who sprang to mind.",
      "Mount managed one goal and one assist. A potential breakthrough away to Brentford, where he put a rudderless United in front on 96 minutes, was quashed by a 99th minute equaliser. When Mount was eventually upgraded to starter, it was at Selhurst Park for the season’s nadir.",
      "To compound Mount’s malaise, Bruno Fernandes has the Sir Matt Busby statue back in his abode and Kobbie Mainoo is the United fans’ darling. Both occupy positions eyed for Mount.",
      "Should Fernandes, the club captain and standout performer of the post-Ferguson era, stay then Mount is not ousting him. Mainoo is the club’s poster boy with a central midfield spot reserved ad infinitum. One of the handful of respectable England performers against Slovakia, United really ought to maximise the nationwide love-in and confirm Mainoo’s squad number now their new shirt is on sale.",
      "Mainoo and Mount is not a compatible partnership, particularly with Fernandes at the apex of the midfield triangle. Yet all three were accommodated in pre-season XIs from New Jersey to Houston last year.",
      "In the former against Arsenal, Mount was paired with Mainoo for the third game running. United won 2-0, albeit in a game their starters made way at half-time, and Mainoo more than held his own against Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. As inconsequential as the friendly was, it marked a sea change in the United midfield.",
      "Four days later against Real Madrid, Casemiro was recalled in what would have been the starting side for the opening Premier League fixture against Wolves but for Rodrygo colliding into Mainoo’s ankle. United had a problem in Houston.",
      "Mount started that watchable 2-0 loss behind the striker, with Fernandes shifted to the right. Fernandes is as dependable as the chameleonic actor and United fan Gary Oldman; whatever new role he assumes, he performs. United’s two wins against Manchester City under Ten Hag were with Fernandes on the right and as a false nine.",
      "Fernandes's selflessness offers Mount a chance. He and Casemiro were a midfield mismatch and the Brazilian may have played his last competitive game for United. Fernandes, as robust as he is, turns 30 in September and he has had his head turned by interest from Champions League clubs. Mount’s best chance of salvaging his United career is to return to the playmaker role he made a name for himself in at Chelsea.",
      "Ten Hag was misguided in plumping for Mount to bring dynamism to the midfield but it was a signing of convenience. Mount had entered the final year of his contract at Chelsea.",
      "United were regularly piqued by coverage of the club last season but can be economical with the truth themselves, such as when Mount was billed as a first-choice target. They would have rather had Jude Bellingham or Declan Rice or Frenkie de Jong.",
      "£55million up front for a 24-year-old England attacking midfielder and veteran of European Championship, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup and World Club Cup finals was not extortionate and United spun the deal as a negotiation success. Then-football director John Murtough “held the line” during discussions. Hook, line and sinker. Chelsea were the only winners in the sale of an injury-prone player running down his contract.",
      "Mount has an uphill task to succeed at United. He is one year into a four-year deal and the years fly by quicker than Mainoo's tap-dancing feet. Anthony Martial was dining off a first United hat-trick this time four years ago. He scored a pitiful 23 more goals for the club in his final four seasons.",
      "Though Mount isn't in Germany, he will be in Trondheim, Edinburgh and the United States with United this month. Mainoo and Fernandes won't be. Mount has five games to settle back into the side.",
      "And give England a glimpse of what they missed.",

      "Several English clubs tried to sign him in 2023 including Chelsea, but PSG ultimately won the race for his signature, snapping him up for around £51million. But Ugarte struggled for form last season, and supposedly lost manager Luis Enrique's faith during PSG's 4-1 defeat to the Magpies in October - subsequently putting him in the shop window.",
      "In an interview with O Jogo, Ugarte's agent confirmed that his client's departure from Paris is now imminent, stating: \"There are many possibilities on the table. It's almost certain that he won't stay, it's sure he'll leave. I believe the situation will be resolved.\"",

He's the kind of player that doesn't have big technical qualities, but mentally and physically, he is strong.",

      "Key parts of Ten Hag's defence are set to leave or have already left Old Trafford this window, with Raphael Varane having departed on a free transfer and names like Casemiro and Sofyan Amrabat tipped to head elsewhere. Therefore, a stalwart in the middle of the park is a position United are desperate to fill, and they'll be hoping it'll be with the in-demand Uruguayan who has also caught the eye of rivals Liverpool.",

      "That's because Martinez's arrival for €7m from Defensa y Justica in May 2019 was always designed to offset the departure of De Ligt. He might have only completed his €75m switch to Juventus in July 2019, but by that stage it was only a case of which club he would choose, rather than whether he would leave Amsterdam.",
      "Although both players were central defenders, they weren't direct replacements. De Ligt had spent his breakout previous season playing on the right side, alongside Daley Blind. As a left-footer, Martinez would be on the other side, although his early months at Ajax were spent in a holding midfield role.",
      "Where they were similar was in terms of leadership and ball-playing ability, and the fact both would turn a substantial profit for Ajax. Three years after De Ligt had gone to Juventus, Martinez left to join Manchester United.",
      "That was at the beginning of the Ajax-ification of the club and it could be about to shift up another level, with De Ligt close to a switch from Bayern Munich to link-up with his former coach Erik ten Hag. De Ligt could become the fifth player in the United squad to have played for Ajax.",
      "It's a transfer based on those Dutch connections. In Turin and Munich he has struggled to live up to the hype. Now the hope is a reunion with Ten Hag will see the 24-year-old realise that potential that looked so obvious five years ago.",
      "He will have a familiar face behind him. Andre Onana arrived at Old Trafford via Milan but has played with both central defenders. All three are comfortable with the ball at their feet and that could finally bring about a transformation in style.",
      "Onana and De Ligt have played 111 games together and Onana and Martinez have shared a pitch on 76 occasions. Those familiarities will be vital to improving the patterns of play from the back.",
      "All three have experience under Ten Hag as well, having played more football under the 54-year-old than any other coach. That experience is 70 games for De Ligt, 179 for Martinez and 196 for Onana. A lot of the requirements should be second nature and the understanding between them should be easy to develop.",
      "Ten Hag wanted United to be better at build-up play last season, but Martinez's injury issues complicated those plans. With his stand-ins struggling to offer the same kind of security on the ball and vision of pass, it became a bit of a muddle and Onana went longer with his distribution than was initially planned.",
      "If a deal for De Ligt is completed, this season could be the chance to change that. Onana has had a year to settle in, Martinez is back fit and playing at the Copa America, while De Ligt knows the coach and knows the players he needs partnerships with.",
      "On paper, there is an attraction to this partnership. Ten Hag will have seen it flickering before his eyes five years ago, just a dream then. Now, on the pitch, he can make it a reality.",

      "Manchester United are huge admirers of Joao Neves and have identified the Portuguese as a potential replacement for Casemiro this summer",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have reportedly seen another bid rejected for Joao Neves.",
      "United have been long-term admirers of the Benfica academy graduate and have him in their list to strengthen their midfield this summer amid uncertainty over Casemiro's future. However, they are not alone in their pursuit, with Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain also linked.",
      "Benfica have been determined to keep hold of the midfielder whom they rate very highly. Playing with experience above his years for the Portuguese giants, earned him a place in Portugal's stacked squad for Euro 2024.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha, Benfica have rejected two offers of £59m (€70m) from both United and PSG for the 19-year-old. This is the second offer United have had rebuffed, following an opening bid of £51m (€60m) last month.",
      "It is claimed Benfica are not willing to entertain any offer which is less than £85m (€100m) but would only sell the player for his release clause which is valued at £101m (€120m). The Eagles president Rui Costa is determined to keep hold of the midfielder as he considers Neves to be a vital player for the squad ahead of next season.",
      "Speaking about his future earlier this year, Neves said: \"Ahead of next season, wherever I may be, I will always give my all. My plan for the moment is to stay at Benfica but you never know, so I can't promise anything.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Portugal teammate Bruno Fernandes addressed the speculation linking the teenager with a move earlier this year. He told Sport TV: \"I don’t know if United rumours are true, but I know he is ready for that big jump. He is an excellent player, he’s with the national team, that’s also why the big clubs are after him.\"",
      "Neves is currently away on international duty with Portugal at the Euros. The midfielder has made two appearances under Roberto Martinez so far, with Portugal set to face France in the quarter-finals on Friday.",
      "Neves has a £101million (€120m) release clause inserted in his contract and Benfica will have no choice but to sell the youngster if a club meets that fee.",

      "Erik ten Hag has reduced the age profile of his Man Utd squad and there is now plenty of potential in the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "On the day Erik ten Hag's Manchester United reign threatened to derail before it even pulled out of the station, almost half of the team he had picked were 29 or over. The sweltering west London heat on the day they were beaten 4-0 by Brentford didn't help some of the more experienced players.",
      "David de Gea (31), Harry Maguire (29), Fred (29), Christian Eriksen (30) and Cristiano Ronaldo (37) all started at Brentford back in August 2022. Another 29-year-old, Raphael Varane, came off the bench. Two years on only two of those six players are still at the club and if Maguire and Eriksen survive the summer cull, they won't be starters next season.",
      "It was a feature of Ten Hag's first season that the squad had plenty of experience. That team selected at Brentford was before the arrival of 30-year-old Casemiro. January bought the temporary additions of 28-year-old Marcel Sabitzer and 30-year-old Wout Weghorst.",
      "This was a team with an ageing profile and it was one of the considerations given as to whether to sign Harry Kane that summer. Kane would have been a guarantee of goals but he would also have been another 30-year-old to add to the ranks. It would have created a spine with only a few years left at the top.",
      "You only need to see the drop-off in Casemiro's game last season to appreciate how quickly that can happen. Two years into a four-year contract, United are willing to let the Brazilian midfielder leave this summer.",
      "Gradually, Ten Hag has reduced the average age of this squad and, in particular, the age of his regular starters. Last summer he spent significant fees on a 20-year-old Rasmus Hojlund, 24-year-old Mason Mount and 27-year-old Andre Onana. All should have their best days ahead of them.",
      "It's a similar story in this window. The two centre-backs United have pursued are Jarrad Branthwaite, 21, and Matthijs de Ligt, 24, while they want to sign Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee, 23. There have also been credited with an interest in Paris St-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte, who is also 23.",
      "That raises the possibility of Ten Hag fielding an XI of players all under 30 on the first day of this season, which would mark an impressive transformation of this squad. That is likely to be dependent on Casemiro leaving and a younger replacement coming in and being ready to play.",
      "But the rest of the side on August 16 could look like: Onana (28), Diogo Dalot (25), De Ligt (24), Lisandro Martinez (26), Luke Shaw (29), Kobbie Mainoo (19), Bruno Fernandes (29), Alejandro Garnacho (20), Marcus Rashdord (26) and Hojlund (21).",
      "Squad players are shunting down the average as well. Back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir is 26, Tyrell Malacia turns 25 on the first weekend of the season, Mount is still only 25, Antony only 24. Throw in the potential for Ugarte and Zirkzee to be in the squad and there is suddenly a youthful flavour to this squad.",
      "That has been the ambition of Ineos but in truth, the groundwork has been laid over the previous 12 months, with this summer window a continuation of that.",

      "Gomes, 23, has started in each of Brazil’s three Copa America games so far and began 32 of his 34 Premier League outings last season, proving to be a versatile asset. Gomes has played as a pivot for his country this summer, but can also play as a more central figure.",

      "Manchester United's hopes of completing the summer signing of Matthijs de Ligt have been boosted following a decisive call by the Bayern Munich centre-back.",
      "Over the last few days, the Netherlands international has been increasingly linked with a move to Old Trafford. Last month, De Ligt emerged as a potential alternative to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite after an opening bid was turned down for the Englishman.",
      "Now, it has been reported that United are 'in talks' with the German clubs over a potential deal for the 24-year-old. His arrival would see him reunite with Erik ten Hag having previously worked with him at Ajax.",
      "Since breaking onto the scene in Amsterdam, De Ligt secured a big-money move to Juventus before switching Turin for Munich. He has made 73 appearances across two seasons for Bayern, and despite injuries hampering his time in Germany, he was a regular in Thomas Tuchel's defence since the turn of the year last season.",
      "A fee of around £42m has been touted for De Ligt this summer, slightly less than the £57m Bayern paid for him two years ago. Now, it seems that the Red Devils have taken an encouraging step towards signing their first player of the summer transfer window.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the defender has given the green light on a move to Manchester following 'direct contacts' with his camp. Personal terms are not thought to be an issue with talks between the two clubs expected to determine whether he will sign.",
      "Speaking shortly after Ten Hag had been confirmed as Manchester United's new manager, De Ligt tipped him to be a success, saying: \"He is someone who loves his job and he loves to work.

      "Joshua Zirkzee could become the latest player Erik ten Hag convinces to join Manchester United after they reportedly spoke last month.",
      "Ten Hag has a handy habit of calling transfer targets during his two years at Old Trafford, with at least four players speaking with the manager before signing. Christian Eriksen and Tyrell Malacia acknowledged that in interviews after arriving.",

      "Sky Italia reported that the manager spoke to Zirkzee during the final week of June. More recently, Sky Sport claimed that Ten Hag held a personal meeting with the player's management at Sport Invest and acknowledged that the manager and player have had direct chats.",
      "Both are Dutch, with the forward coming through the academies at ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord while Ten Hag was the Utrecht head coach. From there, Zirkzee joined Bayern Munich in the summer of 2017, where, two years earlier, Ten Hag was the coach of their reserve team. While their time in Germany did not overlap, it is fair to assume that the manager kept tabs on his former employers after returning to the Netherlands.",
      "United not needing to negotiate a transfer fee with Bologna due to the £34million release clause in Zirkzee's contract with the club means it makes sense for Ten Hag to take this direct approach with his countryman as personal terms are with the player's representative are the pivotal aspect in need of agreeing.",

      "Man Utd have looked at Matthijs de Ligt before but a transfer this summer would be based on the player he was rather than the player he currently is.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "It is six years since Matthijs de Ligt became a record breaker against Manchester United, starting the 2018 Europa League final for Ajax at 17 years and 285 days, becoming the youngest player to start in a major European final.",
      "Already De Ligt seemed destined for greatness and little that happened in the next couple of years altered that narrative. He was the youngest Ajax player to reach a century of appearances and in the same year became the youngest full debutant in the Netherlands’ history.",
      "Now, a move to Old Trafford is on the cards with De Ligt a contender to replace Raphael Varane at the heart of United’s defence. An approach to Bayern Munich for the 24-year-old could be made.",
      "Signing De Ligt is no longer the no-brainer it looked a few years ago, however. In July 2019 he signed for Juventus for €75m, lasting three years in Turin before heading to Bayern Munich for €67m. A further two years on, a move to United would see his value drop further. Questions have been asked since he left Amsterdam.",
      "The history-maker for his country is now peripheral at Euro 2024. Stefan de Vrij has partnered Virgil van Dijk and Micky van de Ven has twice come off the bench in three group games. De Ligt has been an unused substitute throughout the tournament.",
      "This is a player still playing at a good level, but one struggling to fulfil the potential that seemed so obvious five years ago, when he was a 19-year-old being hailed as the heir to Giorgio Chiellini, with a plan to partner the Italian great before inheriting his role as a leader of the defence. Back in 2019 Mourinho discussed the Stockholm final against Ajax and De Ligt.",
      "\"We played against De Ligt two years ago and he already seemed like a 26-year-old, much more experienced than he was,\" Mourinho said. \"Physically he is very strong. Now, two years later, he is genuinely a fantastic football player.\"",
      "Ten Hag had no doubts at Ajax, promoting the teenager to the role of captaincy and constantly talking up his talent and his potential.",
      "“I don’t know if De Ligt has shown 60-80 per cent of his potential,” Ten Hag said in 2019, “but we are talking about one of the best defenders in Europe and I have no doubt that he will soon be number one in this position.”",
      "De Ligt’s time in Turin was difficult to judge. He was moved around the defence, played under three different managers in three seasons and started just 23 games alongside Chiellini in three years. He was a regular in the side but every mistake became a talking point and there was a feeling he wasn’t quite ready.",
      "De Ligt felt the pressure of life at Juventus and also suffered from the change of systems through Maurizio Sarri, Andrea Pirlo and Max Allegri. The switch to Munich was supposed to be a turning point, but similar issues have emerged.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "Last season he started just 23 of Bayern’s 49 games and was often third-choice behind Dayot Upemacano and Kim Min-Jae, even dropping behind Eric Dier at times after his move from Tottenham in January. It’s why he might be available this summer, just two years after joining Bayern.",
      "He has faced criticism once again in Bavaria and was under pressure soon after his arrival, when the club’s former CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said he was “not world class” adding: “I'm even more sceptical about De Ligt. Sure, he's only 22 years old. But the last three seasons at Juventus were lost time for him.",
      "\"He should have been able to develop further after his furious start to his career at Ajax. I think it is very daring to declare him Bayern's chief of defence. You could have kept Niklas Süle.\"",
      "De Ligt never truly won over Thomas Tuchel and although the German has now left Bayern, it seems the Dutchman’s time might be up as well. United need a right-sided centre-back and he could fit the bill, while also being cheaper than Everton’s 21-year-old Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "It would be a risk, however. United would be banking on Ten Hag getting the best out of De Ligt once again. They want the player on his way to greatness, not the one who has found it harder going in the intense environments of Bayern and Juventus. Life at United isn’t exactly quiet either.",
      "Maybe that reunion with his former Ajax boss will lead to a fresh start, but Ten Hag isn’t exactly out of the woods at United, even if he does sign a new deal. If he gets the central defender he has had such an influence on, then it would be a transfer that he simply has to make work. If De Ligt was at “60 to 80 per cent” of his potential in 2019, then he is certainly no closer to fulfilling it now. Maybe Ten Hag can help him do just that.",

      "The end of the last financial year has given Man Utd new life in the transfer window but a change in strategy should avoid any further concerns about financial fair play.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Now, the real business can begin. After an opening to the transfer window dominated by dubious deals, PSR calculations and accountants coining it in, clubs can start to flex whatever muscles they have.",
      "Manchester United avoided the rush to raise cash by June 30, with a series of January loan deals and Alvaro Fernandez’s move to Benfica making sure they were comfortably within their limit on the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "The end of the financial year for clubs’ accounts on June 30 essentially wipes the slate clean. It is a boost for those clubs who didn’t have to sell. Every departure from Old Trafford now is a positive on this year’s accounts, while the £150m loss from 2021/22 will also drop off the monitoring period.",
      "United have experts on PSR in their finance department and having stepped back from the precipice in the first half of 2024, they don’t expect to be in trouble now. The sales of Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho will further enhance their position.",
      "Another reason for the confidence is that, under Ineos, United expect to get better at this sort of stuff. Nobody can look at the transfer business at Old Trafford in recent years and conclude it has been going well. Too often they have sold on the cheap and overspent when buying.",
      "There are two aims for Ineos as they tentatively open the chequebook in their first window. To get better at holding the line and to get better at selling players. Nail both of those ambitions and the books should balance a lot easier.",
      "Look back just over the previous two summers and you will find examples of United being pushed beyond their initial budget for players. Antony, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund were all more expensive than had initially been planned for and none of them have so far delivered a return on that investment. It feels like it’s already too late for Antony to show he’s worth £85m, but time is still on the side of Mount and Hojlund to look like value at £55m and £64m.",
      "United’s striker search looks relatively routine, for now. If they push ahead with plans to sign Joshua Zirkzee then it’s an uncomplicated deal to do thanks to his £34m release clause.",
      "The test will come with defensive reinforcements. Everton continue to demand at least £70m for Jarrad Branthwaite. United had a £43m offer, including £8m of add-ons rejected. This tug of war will tell us plenty about Ineos.",
      "They could yet sign a second centre-back, or could pivot away from Branthwaite to pursue a deal with Bayern Munich for Matthijs de Ligt. That might be an easier deal to do but there is a reason Bayern are keen to sell, just as Juventus were a couple of years ago.",
      "So will the plan be to get better at offloading players. They need to sell to raise funds this summer and Greenwood and Sancho will be a good start, with significant interest in both. It will be more difficult, bordering on the impossible, to sell Donny van de Beek.",
      "Then there are squad players like Victor Lindelof and Aaron Wan-Bissaka that could be sold, with decisions to be made on Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay. If those two are to depart it will only be to an offer too enticing to refuse.",
      "But as July dawns, United’s financial position has improved. They had enough spare last week to have signed Branthwaite, only for Everton to avoid the need to sell thanks to some convenient deals involving academy players.",
      "Business will step up over the next week or two, with pre-season resuming at Carrington next Monday. Erik ten Hag will want new players in as early as possible but United will be determined to hold the line, rather than splashing the cash around freely as they have in the last two summers. That almost got them into a mess.",

      "Manuel Ugarte could be blocked from taking his preferred No.4 shirt at Manchester United if Erik ten Hag decides to keep Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "United have received approval to sign Uruguay star Ugarte from both the player and Paris Saint-Germain. The interest in Ugarte comes amid uncertainty in the defensive-midfield position, with Casemiro seemingly past his prime and Ten Hag set for talks to weigh up whether Amrabat will be signed on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Amrabat spent last term on loan with the Red Devils, joining from Fiorentina for an initial £8.5million fee and a £21.5m option to make the move permanent. His first season in England produced mixed results with Ten Hag using him sparingly.",
      "He started just 17 matches and went five months without starting a Premier League game until he was included in the line-up for the home defeat to Arsenal in the second last week of the season.",
      "However, after a standout performance in the FA Cup final victory over rivals Manchester City, United have been considering offering him a permanent deal.",
      "Ten Hag, who is expected to sign a new multi-year contract to continue as United manager, will soon discuss the possibility of purchasing Amrabat with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth, technical director Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada.",
      "Amrabat is still featured in the first-team players section on United's website. He was also included in the promotion for their new jersey.",
      "If the Moroccan stays at Old Trafford, Ugarte may need to choose a different number from his current No. 4 shirt at PSG. Yet that might not be a major issue, given that it hasn't exactly brought him luck in Paris.",
      "Ugarte joined PSG last year in a £51m transfer but is now anticipated to depart after failing to make an impact under Luis Enrique. He has a history of donning various shirt numbers throughout his career, previously wearing 20, 8, 15 and 14 for his club sides and currently the No.5 for Uruguay.",
      "Out of his previous shirt numbers, Ugarte could only hope for the No 15 shirt as Harry Maguire currently occupies the No 5 while Bruno Fernandes wears 8, Christian Eriksen dons 14 and Diogo Dalot is United's No 20.",
      "United, meanwhile, have had a less than fortunate record when it comes to those who have worn the No.4 jersey in the past. Prior to Amrabat, the shirt was worn by Phil Jones, Owen Hargreaves, Gabriel Heinze, Juan Sebastien Veron and David May.",

      "Marcus Rashford could be on the move from Old Trafford this summer",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "The future of Marcus Rashford at Manchester United has been a topic of rumour and speculation for some time.",
      "Having signed a new five-year contract in July of last year, a deal worth some £325,000 per week, the 26-year-old was so out of form for United last season to the extent that he was overlooked by Gareth Southgate for England’s Euro 2024 squad.",
      "The MEN understands the preference is for Rashford to remain in the hope that he finds his spark once more and delivers the kind of performances that saw him plunder 30 goals during the 2022/23 season.",
      "But there is also a growing acceptance that alternative solutions should be considered, including potentially selling him.",
      "The arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe as minority owner at the start of the year, with oversight over matters pertaining to football strategy at Old Trafford, has seen something of a step change for United, with the club’s approach set to be more considered in the transfer market and less frivolous, with a stronger focus on buying the right profile of player at the right price, and ensuring that they improve their player trading performance, which has fallen well short of their ‘big six’ rivals in recent years.",
      "When a player is signed the guaranteed transfer sum is, for accounting purposes, divided equally by the number of years on the contract via a process called amortisation, with the period capped at five years.",
      "When players are sold, regardless of the instalment plan involved, the guaranteed fee received for the player can be accounted for in its entirety straightaway for that financial year.",
      "Players hold book value on the balance sheet. For each year of the contract that passes the book value diminishes until it is gone entirely. What that means is that any time a player is sold within a contract period, where they have a remaining book value (eg two years remaining at £5m per year amortisation charges) then in order for the selling club to reach a profit then they must sell for over and above the remaining book value (eg £10m to use the previous example).",
      "For academy graduates it is different, they hold no book value meaning that any sale generates pure profit. The sheer volume of academy graduates to have been sold by Chelsea in the past two years has allowed them to remain compliant with the Premier League’s profit and sustainability regulations, albeit with the added help of selling off tangible assets such as hotels in inter-company deals.",
      "Raising revenues for clubs beyond commercial revenue, broadcast, and matchday revenue has taken on increasingly greater importance for clubs at a time when wages, transfer fees, and administrative expenses have skyrocketed.",
      "Effective player trading is something that clubs can have greater control over with good strategy, something that is likely to feature heavily for Ratcliffe and his United plan moving forward.",
      "The sale of Rashford wouldn’t yield the kind of sums that it may have done 12 or 18 months ago, but even by conservative estimates it is fair to assume that £60m would be a reasonable fee for United to expect. Factor into that the £16.9m a year in wages paid to Rashford and the appeal in putting that money to work elsewhere in search of greater returns may be understandable.",
      "PSR remains in situ for this coming season before it is replaced by a model akin to UEFA’s squad cost ratio rule, where wages, amortisation costs, and intermediary costs are offset against revenue generated and player trading profit.",
      "United don’t have a PSR deficit to make up as they were just the right side of it heading into a new financial year without the need for selling players. To have £60m pure profit in the coming year would allow them to heavily invest in player talent at a time when they have a new £60m-per-year deal shirt deal in place with Snapdragon, an increase on the previous deal with TeamViewer.",
      "For example, the £60m that could arrive from Rashford would far outweigh the annual amortisation cost that could occur through a £34m deal for Joshua Zirkzee, and a £70m deal for Jarrad Branthwaite, however difficult the latter looks right now.",
      "Ratcliffe wants to reduce payroll and be more efficient in the market, and that would be aided by generating significant player profit at a time when Scott McTominay and Mason Greenwood could also be moved on if the right offers arrived, both for pure profit.",
      "Selling those three players could potentially be transformational for United’s transfer business in the short to medium term, and all for losing players who haven’t been as impactful as hoped for.",

      "Manchester United are said to have missed out on the chance to sign Arsenal target Pedro Neto for next to nothing.",
      "The Gunners have long admired the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger and could finalise a £60million deal for the 24-year-old this summer. The Portuguese star joined Wolves in 2019 from Braga, following a loan spell at Lazio. However, before his move to Italy, United were believed to be closely monitoring the promising attacker.",
      "According to The Athletic, United identified Neto in early 2017 and even invited the then-teenager to Carrington. Despite impressing coaches and scouts during an academy game, it took too long for a contract to be sanctioned, it is claimed, leading Neto to sign a new deal with Braga before joining Lazio on a long-term loan.",
      "He later moved to Wolves in 2019 and made his senior international debut a year later. The hesitation is consistent with claims from former club scouts, who say they discovered talents, only for the club to not act quickly enough to tie them down.",
      "The Red Devils were also said to have identified current Bayern Munich and Germany star Jamal Musial and Moises Caicedo, now of Chelsea, early in their development. Lyndon Tomlinson, who served as the assistant head of academy recruitment at United from 2017 to 2021, told The Athletic: \"I think it's just being decisive and getting things over the line, that was always the problem.",
      "\"In terms of the scouting, the structure and system we had - look at [Alejandro] Garnacho - was good. The reports were there, the process was there. We were just being let down at the end of it.",
      "\"That's why I left, ultimately. I was getting frustrated that we were doing reports, I was travelling here, there and everywhere, [and] studying lots of video during Covid. We were making recommendations and then there was just nothing really happening.\"",

      "Manchester United's ability to generate 'pure profit' is a vital transfer tool in the summer transfer window amid profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United are keen observers of the mad Premier League scramble. The June 30 'mini transfer deadline' is fast approaching as clubs attempt to balance the books to ensure they do not fall foul of the division's spending rules.",
      "United are not one of those sides who need to sell to ensure they meet their profit and sustainability [PSR] obligations. They reputedly have a buffer of around £31million, according to some financial football oberervers.",
      "In recent days many of United's rivals have used unofficial 'loopholes' to try and skirt around the controversial rules, with the Premier League looking to further clamp down on clubs finding creative ways to buy and sell. Chelsea, for example, have sold hotels and properties they own to present a better balance sheet, while the Blues have also been involved in de facto swap deals with clubs such as Aston Villa just days before the deadline.",
      "One more 'loophole' of sorts is the 'pure profit' stance, which sees teams sell their academy products and graduates to generate revenue. For United, it would involve selling someone like Mason Greenwood or Marcus Rashford, who were not signed for a transfer fee and can be registered as an entire profit upon their departure.",
      "The aforementioned duo remain on United's books, although Greenwood is almost certain to depart this summer. The forward is attracting interest from a host of European clubs, with United in talks with Marseille over a potential move.",
      "Other clubs have benefitted from such deals in the past, no more than Aston Villa when they sold Jack Grealish for £100m after developing him into a Premier League-class England international. Chelsea too have made a habit of offloading their homegrown assets - getting £55m from United for Mason Mount, as an example, last summer.",
      "Manchester City have also been brilliant at this in recent years. They received almost £47m from Chelsea for Cole Palmer and got more than £40m combined James Trafford, Tommy Doyle and Taylor Harwood-Bellis.",
      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire recently summarised the situation, explaining that while academies were once designed to develop players to enable their first-team rise, now clubs are seeking to improve their homegrown talent simply to sell on for big money.",
      "“What we have seen is the commodification of academy players,” he told the Athletic. “You only have to sell one Mason Mount every four or five years to pay for your academy.",
      "“In the case of Chelsea, they have done fantastically well. Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Tammy Abraham, Billy Gilmour… all of these (former academy) players have generated huge sums in transfer fees.”",
      "United have received 'pure profit' recently from four noteworthy sales - James Garner's £15m move to Everton and Andreas Pereira's switch to Fulham for £10m in 2022, and last summer when Dean Henderson and Anthony Elanga joined Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest respectively for around £30m combined.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos strategists running the football operations will be aware of how this loophole can improve their spending power. If a fee of £30m can be achieved for Greenwood and a sizeable fee banked Hannibal Mejbri this summer, it will hand a significant FFP boost.",
      "United will also have a number of players coming through their ranks that they will be able to potentially sell on. Omari Forson has gone but United are entitled to a \"sizeable\" training fee. That will also be the case when Shola Shoretire joins a new club.",
      "Academy director Nick Cox revealed that the focus at Carrington will remain on developing players for football purposes, not financial, but admits that being able to sell them on is something the club has always done, ever since Sir Alex Ferguson recognised the importance.",
      "\"As long as there have been football clubs, they have taken that approach. It is nothing new,\" he said of selling young players.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson was a master at selling young players, usually for more than they were worth, if he could perceive they weren’t going to be part of his squad in the long term. Football clubs have always operated in that way.",
      "\"Yes, what you have discussed puts an emphasis on player development. But this club is about so much more than a business plan. We have a duty to ensure young players play in our first team.\"",
      "The 'pure profit' benefit, however, is something that Ineos will recognise as vitally important in the club's transfer strategy moving forward, as other Premier League clubs have done.",

      "It was ten years ago that Luke Shaw touched down in England after his first international tournament, appropriately in Manchester. Two days later, he was unveiled by United.",
      "Shaw's tenth anniversary with the club was spent proving his fitness in Blankenhain. Little has changed. His United career was barely a month old when Louis van Gaal declared the left back was \"not fit\".",
      "Shaw, 29 next month, was not fit often enough in his first season and played only 21 times. That 2015-16 campaign that started so auspiciously was horrifically halted by Hector Moreno in Eindhoven and there were lengthy absences, unenforced and enforced, under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Across ten seasons, Shaw has averaged 27.5 appearances per season for United. He has not played since Luton Town away on February 18, a week after he felt his hamstring tighten at Aston Villa. Shaw apportioned blame to himself, the medical staff and Erik ten Hag.",
      "His inclusion in the England squad, announced four days before the FA Cup final, and absence on the teamsheet at Wembley caused some dismay. Fans put two and two together and got five. Shaw was impelled to address them in a defensive post on social media.",

      "There was morbid curiosity amid Malacia's year-long absence, with online conspiracy theories abound. Malacia never surfaced in the directors' box at Old Trafford and he was only visible arriving for Marcus Rashford's infamous birthday party at Chinawhite on Deansgate in October.",
      "He finally appeared at a game for the FA Cup final. Malacia fleetingly walked through the mixed zone and gave a positive response when asked how his rehabilitation was going.",
      "United are back at Carrington a week on Monday and their first friendly is against Rosenborg in Trondheim the following week. Provided he is fit enough, Malacia is pencilled in to start that and against Rangers at Murrayfield five days later.",
      "The provisional plan will be for players to play a half in those matches before stepping up to an hour-long shift in Los Angeles for the first tour match against Arsenal. Real Betis in San Diego is sandwiched between Arsenal in LA and Liverpool in South Carolina.",
      "Ten Hag has always used friendly matches as a blueprint for the start of the season. The only change from the defeat to Real Madrid on July 25 against Wolves on August 14 was Antony for the injured Kobbie Mainoo. Had Rodrygo not collided into Mainoo's ankle, the probability is United would have been unchanged at Old Trafford.",
      "Behind Malacia in the queue at left back is Harry Amass. The 17-year-old only joined the academy from Watford last year, trained with the first team in February, was on the bench in March and at Wembley in April.",
      "In the harmonious video United released of the under 18s' return to Carrington after their title-clinching win at Wolves, Ten Hag was particularly warm with Amass as he clasped hands with the players. Ten Hag asks Amass, dining in the canteen, something. Amass smiles and replies, \"I'm good.\"",
      "Amass was not in the squad at the Sir Jack Hayward training ground and the FA Cup semi-final was four days away. Ten Hag named Amass on the bench against Coventry.",
      "He had been a substitute at Bournemouth three days earlier, the second in a run of seven successive matches in the first team matchday squad. Amass did not play in the U18s' last five league games and his 45-minute outing in the Premier League Cup win against Manchester City was pre-arranged as he would be in the squad against Sheffield United 24 hours later.",
      "The U18 coach Adam Lawrence, a fellow southerner in Manchester, said Amass has settled in well and is \"excited\" about his long-term potential. Ten Hag privately conceded Amass, Habeeb Ogunneye, Louis Jackson and academy graduate 250 Ethan Wheatley were making up the numbers during those depleted weeks in April and May. Their challenge the other side of the Atlantic will be to obtain new numbers on the back of their shirts.",
      "Ogunneye could be a starting right back, depending on how hastily a transfer is arranged for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Wheatley could be the only out-and-out centre forward with first team minutes and Jackson can expect minutes with Lisandro Martinez recovering from his Copa America excursions.",

      "United celebrated their 250th academy graduate to play for the first team in April when Ethan Wheatley made his debut and the club prides itself on its long history of youth development, with an academy player in every first-team matchday squad since 1937.",
      "Cox pointed out that selling academy players had always been part of the model at United, but insisted the focus would never move away from the aim of bringing players through to play for the club.",
      "\"As long as there have been football clubs, they have taken that approach. It is nothing new,\" he said of selling young players.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson was a master at selling young players, usually for more than they were worth, if he could perceive they weren’t going to be part of his squad in the long term. Football clubs have always operated in that way.",
      "\"Yes, what you have discussed puts an emphasis on player development. But this club is about so much more than a business plan. We have a duty to ensure young players play in our first team.",
      "\"I think our priority will always be to nurture players to play in our first team because of all the things I have mentioned about our youth programme, which is our biggest connection to our heritage. Fans expect to see young players in our first team. It is just the way things are around here.",
      "\"For this club, I don’t have any worries or concerns about that changing trend. How that might unfold elsewhere I don’t know but what I do know is there are some incredible academies in this country that have evolved significantly.",
      "\"That is due to Premier League governance and some extra investment because of the money the Premier League generates. What I am seeing across the country, at all levels and all categories of academies, some real whole-hearted youth development that is going on in the best interests of young people.",
      "\"They are all taking the same approach that I do in terms of trying to create amazing learning environments. Academies are amongst the most inspirational learning environments you will find anywhere. That is a step change from where we might have been 20 years ago.\"",

      "It's been a turbulent week for Manchester United Women but the arrival of Dan Ashworth could be exactly what they need to get back on track",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Though Mary Earps' Manchester United goodbye message totaled 370 words, perhaps the biggest factor behind her decision to leave the club can be gleaned from just one: 'Transition'.",
      "Those 10 measly characters, deployed by Earps to describe the current state of play at Leigh Sports Village, rather concisely explain why one of the game's biggest stars feels the best thing for her career is to seek pastures new this summer. The 31-year-old's departure did not, admittedly, come as much of a surprise.",
      "Hers is an exit almost 12 months in the making, the portent of which can be traced back to Arsenal's failed world-record bid for her services last September. Still, though, in conjunction with a number of other happenings at United over the past few weeks, confirmation of Earps' leaving has been viewed in some quarters as an ominous indicator of the Reds' direction of travel.",
      "\"It's a decision l've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly,\" the England No. 1 wrote on social media on Saturday. \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
      "That new challenge is set to take Earps to the French capital, where she will become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). It is understood, however, United's offer of a new deal matched Earps' expectations and therefore her decision to leave the club is rooted not in finances but in a desire to be successful on the pitch.",
      "Clearly, the shot-stopper remains unconvinced about the Reds' ability to yield such success in the near future. Despite winning the Women's FA Cup - the club's first major piece of women's silverware - last term, it's hard to argue with the fact that United's performances in 2023/24 left much to be desired.",
      "Marc Skinner's side finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL), winning just 10 of their 22 league games and registering a points tally 21 points lower than the one recorded in the previous campaign. A 6-0 defeat to champions Chelsea at Old Trafford on the final day was a crushing nadir for a team who had taken the title race to the final day only 12 months earlier, and the travelling support took great pleasure in making Earps the chief subject of their derision, regularly taunting her with chants of 'Mary, what's the score?'",
      "There is an argument, though, that United's malaise on the field is a symptom of the pervasive uncertainty off it. It has been a turbulent year for the Reds, who came under fire last summer for letting star duo Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo depart on free transfers, with the latter joining WSL rivals Arsenal.",
      "Then there was the Mason Greenwood debacle, which opened a number of female players up to online abuse on the eve of decisive Women's World Cup games. Couple this with the departure of numerous backroom staff, including highly-rated assistant manager Martin Ho and head of women's football Polly Bancroft, and it is easy to see why some players may feel United is, at present, a club in flux.",
      "Those feelings have only intensified since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in February. The INEOS chief caused a stir when he opted not to attend the Women's FA Cup final in May, instead making an appearance at Old Trafford for what was, for the hosts, something of a dead-rubber Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Days later came confirmation of a new contract for manager Skinner - a decision that was not particularly well-received by the United fanbase, in spite of the FA Cup triumph. And then there was last week, when it seemed as if every day brought with it a new PR fire for the Reds to put out.",
      "First, there was Ratcliffe's tone-deaf interview with Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\". Next came the revelation that Skinner's side are set to be ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp - and that's before you consider the exodus of first-team stars, including Earps and club captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cue the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United; a dangerous cocktail of bad news that does not inspire much hope of positive change at the club.",
      "Still, amidst all the negativity, there are green shoots of optimism. According to BBC Sport, United are closing in on deals to sign Brighton & Hove Albion forward Elisabeth Terland and former Arsenal defender Dominique Janssen.",
      "The duo are at opposite ends of the experience spectrum but could both have a hugely positive impact at Leigh Sports Village. Terland scored 13 goals in the WSL last term, with only Manchester City's Khadija Shaw finding the back of the net more frequently than the 23-year-old.",
      "Janssen, meanwhile, has won two league titles and starred in two Champions League finals for German side Wolfsburg, having previously won the WSL with the Gunners. United are also expected to trigger the option-to-buy clause in the loan agreement of highly-rated Lyon forward, Melvine Malard.",
      "With midfielder Grace Clinton set to return to Manchester following a hugely successful loan spell at Tottenham Hotspur and the likes of Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa expected to play a bigger role following their respective returns to full fitness, the Reds look to have have the makings of a strong squad.",
      "Perhaps one of the most heartening developments for the women's team, though, came on Monday morning, when it emerged sporting director Dan Ashworth is free to begin work at United after breakthrough talks with former club Newcastle. The two clubs have come to an agreement over compensation after an acrimonious four months of talks, avoiding the need for an arbitration hearing to settle the matter.",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players. Speaking to the Guardian in 2022, Ashworth outlined the club's vision for Newcastle Women, who were, at the time, plying their trade in the fourth tier.",
      "\"(The women's team) is absolutely a priority for the owners,” he said. “Already, they’ve gone from a team where the players had to pay to play last year to being professionalised. We will do everything we can to give them the support to get to the WSL as quickly as possible.”",
      "His comments were reminiscent of a similar statement he made during his time as technical director of Brighton & Hove Albion. “The aim now is to get a foothold in the top division, being a new club and new women’s programme compared to some of the teams in that division,\" Ashworth told club media back in 2019.",
      "“We aim to do that by maximising our resources, trying to recruit cleverly, coach well and get the results to keep us in the division. It comes back to the club’s long-term vision, which is to make us a top four women’s team. It will take time, effort and investment to do that, but we’re on the right lines to do it.”",
      "By joining United, Ashworth is joining a club with significantly more resources than Brighton and with a bigger global brand than Newcastle. If he is able to lend some of his expertise to Skinner's side, there is a chance the Reds could soon find themselves back on the right path and their period of transition might just lead them into a brighter new era.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed his minority purchase of Manchester United, he was keen to stress that he would not just be focused on the men's team.",
      "United were late to the women's football revolution but since earning their place in the Women's Super League they have become a threat. A fifth-placed finish last season was underwhelming considering they were runners-up the year before but the foundations appeared to be in place to regroup.",
      "However, in our latest look at the media headlines an admission by agents suggests this progress is no more which should be of great embarrassment to Ineos.",
      "According to journalist Katie Whyatt in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, the United women's team is no longer seen as a priority since Ratcliffe's arrival. She claimed that 'horror stories' have come out of Old Trafford regarding Ineos' running of the squad with agents reportedly telling their clients not to move to United.",
      "On Saturday it emerged that goalkeeper Mary Earps will be the latest United player to leave shortly after captain Katie Zelem was announced as departing at the expiry of her contract.",
      "What MEN Sport says: The revelations surrounding the United women's team and the lack of care that Ratcliffe has shown should bring shame on both himself and Ineos as a whole. The Reds' co-owner has often spoken about wanting to emulate the recent success of Manchester City and it is disappointing to discover that only expands to the men's team. In this day and age there is really no excuse to allow the women's team to go to rack and ruin. It also gives United a bad image which could taint hopes of securing major sponsorship deals at a time when the club needs the money. Ratcliffe needs to address this situation quickly before it does any more damage.",
      "Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake has told Dutch media outlet AD the prospect of moving to United is at the forefront of his mind but that he will not let it cloud his duty towards his current team. \"I owe it to them (Go Ahead Eagles to carry on as normal),\" he explained.",
      "\"It's not in the back of your head, but in your forehead. It can't get any crazier (than moving to United), can it?\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Since being linked with a place on the coaching staff at United, Hake has caught the attention of the fanbase. Videos have circulated on social media of his no-nonsense management style which many feel this current squad of players are crying out for. These comments by the Dutchman should also be warmly received to. It is clear that he wants to be at Old Trafford and is not against stepping back into an assistant role. It seems as though he is exactly what the dressing room needs at this moment.",
