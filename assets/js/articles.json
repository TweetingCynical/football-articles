      "Philip Mulryne has become a well-regarded member of the Catholic community after trading the football pitch for the priesthood. The Northern Irishman enjoyed a three-year stint at Manchester United but managed only five first-team appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "Rising through the academy at Old Trafford, Mulryne had the ability to operate as a forward, midfielder or on the right wing - offering tactical flexibility to the squad. However, a plethora of stars, including David Beckham and Paul Scholes, meant that breaking into the first XI proved virtually impossible.",
      "He ultimately departed Sir Alex Ferguson's outfit in 1999 to join Norwich City in a £500,000 deal, where he made 170 appearances and scored 20 goals from the midfield.",
      "Subsequent spells at Cardiff City and Leyton Orient rounded off a distinguished footballing career. He also earned 27 caps for Northern Ireland, scoring three times in international colours.",
      "Mulryne hung up his boots in 2008 and opted for a dramatic career transformation, rather than pursuing coaching or media work like many former professionals. The ex-player began his preparation for the Catholic priesthood at 31 following an epiphany during his final season at Norwich.",
      "In a 2018 interview with the club's official website, Mulryne said: \"It's hard to pin down a particular moment. I would say it started in my last year at Norwich, not explicitly and I wasn't thinking about it at that time but I started to get dissatisfied with the whole lifestyle.",
      "\"We have a wonderful life as a footballer and I was very privileged, but I found with all the surrounding stuff that eventually there was a kind of emptiness with it. I was quite shocked - why am I not happy when I have everything that young men want?",
      "\"It started me on a journey towards exploring my faith again, the faith that I had as a young man. I took a decision to come home for a year and it was really during that year that everything turned upside down.",
      "\"I volunteered at a homeless shelter for a while. I started going back to mass and I started praying again on a regular basis. I just found a real sense of fulfilment with it. Football was huge highs and lows and here was something that was giving me a steady sense of contentment.\"",
      "The ex-midfielder, who now carries the title Reverend Father Philip Mulryne, was first ordained as a deacon in 2016 before becoming a priest for the Dominican Order in 2017.",
      "The ex-midfielder has devoted his life to the Catholic Church(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)",
      "Around this period, the former United player was declared bankrupt at Belfast's High Court. The Mail reported that it was understood the 47-year-old had invested money in a fund that exploited a legal loophole, offering tax relief to those investing in the film industry.",
      "This arrangement was reportedly utilised by numerous other football stars, as it offered them substantial reductions on their tax bills. Before being declared insolvent, Mulryne held membership in Tudor Films LLP and Zeus Films LLP.",
      "The priest suggested this bankruptcy was a \"self-adjudication\", hinting that he may have declared the problem himself. Now, Mulryne leads a congregation at St Mary's Priory Church in Cork and has no regrets about his decision to dedicate himself to the Lord.",
      "He added: \"My vocation to priesthood and religious life came later in the course of that year - I felt this strong desire for this way of life and I stayed with it for a few months and then got the courage up to explore it. I took the decision and it's now eight years later.\"",

      "Manchester United will have to wait until the summer if they want to sign England international Elliot Anderson, with Nottingham Forest standing firm, with their not for sale stance in January.",

It was a very nice conversation together with Jonny Evans at that time, who was the loan manager (at United), but at that time, he chose West Brom, which is OK I respect that.",
      "\"Maybe he didn't believe that we would have a good season, and have a good team. It was tricky back then, when you have an embargo, you cannot bring the players. Also, you must look after yourself because you need the minutes, and maybe in our team it's easier to get the minutes.\"",

He remains under contract until 2028, albeit the Red Devils have an option to extend his stay by a further campaign. But it appears that a decision is set to be taken over his long-term future at Old Trafford.",

The former Sporting Lisbon chief lasted just 14 months in the role after being selected to replace Erik ten Hag by the Old Trafford hierarchy.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will have plenty to sort out if he returns to Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Incorporating £128million worth of talent into the team could be one of the first challenges for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if he is reinstated as Manchester United boss. The Norwegian icon is discussing his potential return with the club this weekend, with a view to taking the reins for the remainder of the season.",
      "Michael Carrick is also being considered for the interim role before United appoint a permanent successor to the recently dismissed Ruben Amorim in the summer. Amorim's downfall was partly due to his tactical inflexibility, persisting with a 3-4-3 formation featuring two No. 10s.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (£65m) and Matheus Cunha (£63m) were brought in for substantial fees in the summer to fill those positions. Under Solskjaer, United are likely to adopt a different approach, creating a scenario Ineos hadn't anticipated when they approved the pair's arrival.",
      "During his first stint manager after succeeding Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer favoured width, utilising both full-backs in a flat back four and wingers on either side of a central striker and number 10.",
      "This preference for wingers continued during his mixed eight-month stint at Besiktas. Solskjaer didn't get the players he needed in Turkey, which arguably contributed to his dismissal in August after the Istanbul giants were knocked out in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League.",
      "Turkish football expert and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit believes Solskjaer was hindered by a shortage of quality wide players. He said: \"It (the style of play) wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo insists he is happy to play anywhere(Image: SmartFrame/SportImage)",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "There's no reason why Mbeumo and Cunha couldn't feature together under Solskjaer, though it's unlikely to be as part of a dual number 10 system. Mbeumo spent the majority of his time at Brentford thriving as a right winger and is prepared to adapt to different roles when needed.",
      "Following his move to Old Trafford, he said: \"It's up to the manager to decide. It's important to be able to play in different positions, so I will play wherever I'm asked to play.\"",
      "Matheus Cunha was brought in primarily to play as a number 10(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Mbeumo will return to England shortly after Cameroon suffered a 2-0 defeat to Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations. However, current interim boss Darren Fletcher has confirmed he won't be available for Sunday's FA Cup clash against Brighton.",
      "Fletcher said: \"I don't think so. I think it's too close a turnaround, so we'll have the same players available for the game as we had against Burnley.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Cunha poses potentially a larger problem. With Bruno Fernandes anticipated to occupy the lone No. 10 position in a 4-2-3-1 formation, it's unclear where exactly the Brazilian would fit in.",

      "This is a United side that are fresh off the back of the club’s worst-ever Premier League season, while they have shown their vulnerabilities this term, too. So what could Solskjaer version two look like?",
      "The most pressing issue that Solskjaer will have to decide on is his tactical approach at Old Trafford. His preferred formation was a 4-2-3-1 during his first spell with the club and that appeared to earn instant results as United won 14 of his 19 games as interim boss.",
      "That would represent a huge departure from the staunch 3-4-3 system that was regularly deployed by Amorim. While it would be a change, it could be argued that the players would be slightly more comfortable.",
      "Amorim made the change to a four-back formation last month and earned dividends. Caretaker boss Darren Fletcher also deployed a 4-2-3-1 in the recent draw at Burnley. So Solskjaer might be tempted to stick with that set-up.",
      "That will likely please his potential employers as well. A huge area of friction between Amorim and Football Director Jason Wilcox was his tactical stubbornness.",
      "Solskjaer left man United in 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Plenty was expected of Benjamin Sesko following his £74m move from RB Leipzig but the Slovenian has so far failed to hit the heights expected of him. He has just four goals to his name - albeit two of those came in his most recent outing.",
      "If anyone understands the pressure and the expectation of leading the line for United, it’s Solskjaer. Some advice and an arm around the shoulder from the Norwegian might be all that Sesko needs to unlock his true form.",
      "Failing that, some detailed training drills at Carrington will surely give Sesko some much needed guidance on how to put the ball in the net.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has scored just four goals for Manchester United so far(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Last time Solskjaer was put in charge at United, it was once again on an interim basis with the intention to appoint a more high-profile name come the end of the campaign. But Solskjaer impressed so much that he was appointed on a full-term basis.",
      "Should the same situation arise this time around then it would be interesting to see both his and the club’s verdict on another extended stay. Should Solskjaer want a more permanent gig, then that could potentially force them to look elsewhere, particularly given how things ended between the two parties last time.",
      "A second permanent stint for Solskjaer might not satisfy fans either. But if he is happy taking the reins for the time being to then move aside when the time is right, it could be a profitable partnership for all.",
      "Solskjaer claimed the permanent job the last time he acted as interim(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Given that Solskjaer will arrive at Old Trafford on a temporary basis, it seems unlikely that United chiefs will be comfortable throwing huge funds around in the transfer market.",
      "Amorim found that a source of huge frustration, believing he was not being given the tools to complete the job to the level he wanted.",
      "Solskjaer will also have to make do with the current crop of players at the club. And while that is not an issue in an attacking sense - the Red Devils having already invested heavily in their attack in the summer - there are still glaring gaps in both midfield and defence.",
      "That could well hamstring United for the rest of the season so it depends whether Solskjaer would be willing to work without any real backing.",
      "Upon leaving back in November 2021, Solskjaer revealed his main complaint was the behaviour of some players. As quoted by The Athletic, Solskjaer said: \"Some weren't as good as their own perception of themselves.”",
      "He added: \"I won't name names, but I was very disappointed when a couple turned down the chance to be captain. I was also disappointed when others said they wouldn't play or train because they wanted to force their way out.\"",
      "Of course, there has been quite the overhaul within the dressing room but United remain questioned on the culture at the club. Some players have been linked with exits, while others seem dissatisfied with life at the club. That may be something that Solskjaer will want to rectify.",
      "Whether that means moving some players out or getting them back onside with a quiet word remains to be seen, but that is arguably one of his biggest tasks as he prepares to return to Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United under a cloud following his second stint(Image: 2022 AMA Sports Photo Agency)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo's return to Manchester United in the summer of 2021 was somewhat a success and a failure. His sensational comeback even saw several United players discuss how transformative a signing the Portuguese star was, prior to its sour conclusion.",
      "Initially joining United in 2003, Ronaldo, now 40, went on to cement his status as one of the game's most exceptional talents during his first stint at Old Trafford.",
      "He netted more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributed to United securing three Premier League crowns and the Champions League in 2008. The following year he left for an equally successful stint at Real Madrid, going on to join Juventus for a three-year stay.",
      "Ronaldo, who signed for Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr three years ago, departed United for a second time in November 2022 following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan. He criticised the club's condition and his handling under former United manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "During Ronaldo's first season at United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, his influence was palpable to those at the club. Former Red Devils keeper Lee Grant even spoke about how players were talking to one another about the positive changes he had brought.",
      "Grant told talkSPORT in 2021: \"To give you one instance of the impact he is having on the group, this was Friday night in the hotel. So, as you guys will be aware, you finish your dinner and usually on a Friday night you've got some cheat stuff out. You've got some apple crumble and custard or you've got a bit of brownie and cream.",
      "\"I tell you now, not one player touched the apple crumble and custard, not one player went up for that brownie because everybody was sat down. One of the lads said to me, 'What has Cristiano got on his plate?' Obviously, it is the cleanest, most healthy plate you can imagine.\"",
      "Ronaldo's influence was rapidly felt(Image: INPHO/Ryan Byrne)",
      "Ex-United coach Michael Carrick was part of Solskjaer's coaching team when the Portuguese superstar made his comeback to Old Trafford. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Carrick described the surreal experience of witnessing the legendary Ronaldo back at United's Carrington training ground and how his presence created a thrill around United.",
      "\"Yeah, he was good,\" Carrick said when Ferdinand quizzed him about Ronaldo's comeback. \"I mean, there was a hell of a buzz around the place when he came back. It was an incredible kind of feeling around those games, and then him coming back. And just seeing him back around the building was weird.\"",
      "However, Solskjaer was sacked by United in November 2021 and United made the decision to hire Ralf Rangnick. Ronaldo became increasingly disillusioned by what he was seeing at Old Trafford, something he brought up in his now-infamous interview with Morgan.",
      "\"I don't know what's going on but since Sir Alex Ferguson left [in 2013], I saw no evolution in the club. The progress was zero,\" Ronaldo told Morgan.",
      "Ronaldo endured a tricky time upon returning to Old Trafford(Image: 2022 Manchester United FC)",
      "One of the most memorable incidents that helped seal Ronaldo's exit followed United's 2-0 win over Tottenham in October 2022 when Ronaldo stormed down the tunnel before the end of the game.",
      "United defender Lisandro Martinez was asked to comment on Ronaldo's strop and exit in the immediate aftermath. \"I didn't see anything,\" explained the centre-back, adding: \"I don't know. I only enjoy with the people, we won, and that's important.\"",
      "From being hailed as a returning hero to leaving under a dark cloud, Martinez's remarks, hinting that United's players were too busy celebrating to even notice Ronaldo wasn't in the room, summed up the bitter end to the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's time at United.",

      "Arsenal could lose out on a transfer to their rivals Man United(Image: (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United are reportedly looking to enter the January transfer market with a potential swoop for a player Arsenal have been trying to sign for over a year.",
      "According to The Sun, United are now looking to make a move for Blackburn Rovers youngster Igor Tyjon, with the 17-year-old likely to make a move this winter. The Gunners have been interested in a deal since the summer of 2024, having seen multiple bids worth over £1m rejected by the Championship outfit.",
      "The January transfer window changes the outlook for Blackburn, the player and those teams chasing a move because he is nearing the end of his scholarship. Tyjon has turned down the chance to sign professional terms at Ewood Park in recent months, with the club now resigned to losing him.",
      "January marks the last opportunity for Blackburn to receive a development fee for the young striker before losing him in the summer. If the Championship club leave it too long, then they will only be due compensation for the player in the summer, as he leaves free to sign on elsewhere.",
      "The 17-year-old has made three senior appearances for Rovers, all of which came in the 2024/25 season, with two run-outs in the Championship and one in the EFL Cup. The forward, who has represented both England and Poland at youth international level, has largely continued his development with the academy sides this campaign.",
      "Igor Tyjon has been linked with a move to Man United and Arsenal for the January transfer window(Image: (Photo by Trevor Wilkinson | MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images))",
      "It's unclear how much Blackburn would be willing to accept for Tyjon, but it's a move that seems likely to strengthen the academy ranks of either United or Arsenal. It's a transfer opportunity that further underlines the long-term nature of the plans at both clubs, as well as the awkwardness of the January market as a whole.",
      "For United, there is unlikely to be much business this window, with the attention shifting toward the summer instead. Given the lack of a manager and a clear identity as a result, moving toward younger signings for the future represents a low-risk option to land potential.",
      "There may well be questions over the future of Chido Obi as a result, however. The young striker was involved in the senior team last season for United, as injuries struck the team, but his lack of minutes this season has brought about uncertainty over his place in the team.",
      "\"Chido is not always a starter in the under 21s,\" Ruben Amorim said when asked about a lack of minutes for Kobbie Mainoo, as he pointed towards the academy as a source of struggles. \"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying: 'Sack the manager'. So, you can see that I'm not worried.\"",
      "With Amorim's sacking now confirmed, it may well be that Obi is given more chances to shine in the near future, though there may be more competition with the possible arrival of Tyjon. As for Arsenal, it's clear that sporting director Andrea Berta is turning towards strengthening the academy.",
      "Deals have already been sealed for Edwin and Holger Quintero from Independiente del Valle, as well as Victor Ozhianvuna from Shamrock Rovers. All three signings are 16, and won't be able to join until 2027, but it shows how quickly the Gunners have moved to build on their academy.",
      "The north London club are at a point where they need to win now, having signed plenty of stars entering their peak, such as Viktor Gyokeres and Eberechi Eze. Those players, mixed with some already at the club, will have little resale value when the end of their peak arrives.",
      "Add to that the possibility of them all moving on at similar times, due to the general age profile of the squad, and there is a need to future-proof things. Having academy stars such as Myles Lewis-Skelly, Ethan Nwaneri, and Max Dowman helps them, but there are options out there to strengthen.",
      "Adding Tyjon could bring another layer to that, with Arsenal lacking in striker options in the youth ranks - especially with Andre Harriman-Annous featuring in the senior side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Scottish midfielder, who traded Manchester for Naples, clinched the Serie A title in his debut season. He was named Serie A Footballer of the Year after scoring an impressive 12 league goals in 34 matches last season.",
      "The 29-year-old has continued his exceptional form this season and recently lifted the Supercoppa Italiana. Joining him on his Italian adventure is his girlfriend Cam, who has been affectionately dubbed the 'Queen of Italy' by adoring fans.",
      "It's believed that she met McTominay in the early 2020s and they started dating in 2022, prior to realising his potential at Old Trafford.",
      "Before McTominay began turning heads on the pitch, his model girlfriend was already doing so off it. That’s thanks to her holiday bikini snaps on Instagram, which had fans swooning long before the couple’s move to Italy.",
      "One particular post from the summer of 2023 saw Cam basking in the Saint Tropez sun alongside her footballer beau. She stunned as she posed both solo and with McTominay on a yacht, wearing a striking bikini that showcased her enviable physique.",

      "Manchester United chief Jason Wilcox nudged Ruben Amorim towards the exit door by comparing his own job to the role of a manager. The Portuguese coach was sacked earlier this month after a disappointing year-and-a-half at the helm.",
      "While results certainly played a part in Amorim’s downfall at Old Trafford, other aspects appeared to contribute to the decision to jettison the former Sporting Lisbon boss. It is suggested that his relationship with director of football Wilcox had soured, with one comment in particular irritating Amorim.",
      "According to The Sun, the former Southampton chief compared his own role to the manager’s position at Old Trafford and suggested that Amorim was merely a coach. It is unclear whether Wilcox told the former United boss directly or he was simply made aware.",
      "But either way, the comment left Amorim furious and he sought to clarify his role in his bizarre outburst following the draw with Leeds. He said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.",
      "“And that is clear. I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it’s not [Antonio] Conte, it’s not [Jose] Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United begin their FA Cup campaign this afternoon with the pressure firmly on the Reds to progress to the fourth round of the competition. An early Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby Town piles the expectation on United to advance and give the fans some hope of silverware this season.",
      "As such, interim head coach Darren Fletcher will be eager to keep his side relatively strong, particularly with a challenging Brighton and Hove Albion team visiting the Theatre of Dreams. That does not mean Fletcher will be against making changes though in a bid to keep his squad fresh.",
      "Ayden Heaven has been used plenty over Christmas and New Year so there is certainly a case for dropping him to the bench and welcoming Leny Yoro back into the starting XI. The Frenchman is a year older than Heaven and has played a part in every single Premier League match this season.",
      "However, his confidence has been knocked recently so a positive performance against Brighton could be just what he needs to kickstart his 2026. In midfield, Casemiro looked tired at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. Two holding midfielders are not necessarily the way to go in a 4-2-3-1 system so playing Kobbie Mainoo alongside Manuel Ugarte would be a positive alteration.",
      "Fletcher admitted Mainoo was hard to read on Friday, so it was unclear if he was happy or not at present, but a start at Old Trafford would certainly perk him up. Perhaps the biggest decision Fletcher could make would be to give Shea Lacey his full debut for the club. The 18-year-old only had six minutes at Burnley but he made that count as he showed plenty of attacking promise down the right-hand side and nearly bagged himself his first goal for the club in the process.",
      "Fletcher spoke at length in his press conference about the academy and how pleased he has been with the attitude of the youngsters. This is in stark contrast to Amorim's complaints not too long ago. Alongside Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha, the teenager would have plenty of experience to help him through what could be a tough game.",

Gabriel is just 15 years old, which means he cannot play in the Premier League, but he is eligible to feature in the FA Cup under competition rules.",
      "Gabriel has 11 goals in 14 appearances for United's Under-18s this season. Fletcher was formerly U18 boss before his promotion to caretaker duties, meaning he worked closely with the exciting teenager. United invited Gabriel and his family into the directors' box against Arsenal at the beginning of the season, and the youngster has already taken part in a handful of first-team training sessions.",
      "And while fans have speculated the forward could be included in an FA Cup squad, Fletcher confirmed he would not be involved against Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "\"Well, he could be, but he's not going to be because obviously anybody could be picked,\" said Fletcher. \"JJ is a fantastic talent,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed working with him immensely, getting to know him. He's a young lad with a massive sort of hype, you know there's a lot of noise around him and deservedly so because he's a real talented kid.",
      "\"He works hard. First thing I'd say is he loves football. He loves training, he loves playing, he loves having the ball, he loves expressing himself. He makes fantastic decisions.",
      "\"He's just got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. 15-year-old, a bright future ahead of him. I'm super excited by his talent, but the most important thing is that he keeps developing, and he's in the U18s team, and he's doing fantastically well, but he's still got lots to learn.",
      "\"He's developing within there. But the world's his oyster and he just needs to go on his journey and his time will come in due course. But for just now, it's a little bit early I think and I think a lot of people would agree with me.",
      "\"But I couldn't speak highly enough of JJ. He's got an amazing family and amazing support around him and he's somebody we're delighted to have at the club.",
      "\"And we just hope he keeps improving, learning every day and just keep being the boy that he is really and enjoying love and playing football and going and expressing themselves and scoring lots of goals so the Manchester United under 18s win every game. And then I'll be a happy man.\"",
      "Gabriel became the youngest player to represent United in the FA Youth Cup last month. He started against Peterborough and scored the match-winner in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, breaking the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months). The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked about Gabriel before Christmas. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "United take on Brighton this afternoon.(Image: )",
      "Manchester United begin their FA Cup campaign against Brighton this afternoon. United crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby Town, which means the FA Cup is their only realistic avenue for silverware this season, but Brighton will pose a challenge at Old Trafford.",
      "Darren Fletcher will take charge of his second game as caretaker manager. The former midfielder was on the touchline against Burnley on Wednesday as United were forced to settle for a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor.",
      "United have held talks with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over taking the interim job until the end of the season, but Fletcher will get the chance to oversee the Brighton game. Regarding the team news, Matthijs de Ligt remains unavailable. Harry Maguire's surprise inclusion on Wednesday night will be repeated on Sunday with Fletcher confirming the same players are available this weekend as they were at Burnley.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up...",
      "United can't afford to make too many changes here, they need a cup run and they need the games that come with it. I would make one change at the back, with Leny Yoro getting a chance instead of Heaven, who deserves the breather after a busy run in the side.",
      "Casemiro is a player who could do with a rest for a different reason. He looked fatigued against Burnley and Manuel Ugarte was solid, so he can play the holding role. Kobbie Mainoo can come in with Bruno Fernandes also in midfield.",
      "Patrick Dorgu would be unlucky to miss out but this feels like a chance to give a start to Shea Lacey, who made that electric impact off the bench in midweek. Matheus Cunha has to play again and Benjamin Sesko can build on his impact against Burnley.",
      "Tyrone Marshall's Manchester United XI to take on Brighton in the FA Cup third round(Image: )",
      "Fletcher rolled out the 4-2-3-1 against Burnley and will stick to the plan against Brighton this weekend, but I'd make two changes from the draw in Lancashire on Wednesday night.",
      "Ugarte emerged with credit at Turf Moor while Casemiro underperformed. The Brazilian looked in need of a rest, so I would move him to the bench and give Mainoo just his second start of the season.",
      "Dorgu played a wonderful cross to Sesko for his second goal against Burnley, but Lacey's exciting cameo was full of promise, and I'd give the youngster his full debut on the right side. Lacey has been underutilised this season and could bring some magic to Old Trafford.",
      "Steven Railston's Manchester United XI to take on Brighton in the FA Cup(Image: )",
      "United may want to take a few risks in the FA Cup. Fletcher needs to find a balance between resting some key players while keeping the team strong enough to advance.",
      "Having been chucked in at the deep end since arriving from Belgium, there is no harm resting Senne Lammens and allowing Altay Bayindir a rare start. Bringing Luke Shaw out of the team could also be a wise move to give United the chance to try out Dorgu at left-back ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) absentees returning.",
      "Casemiro desperately needs a rest so bringing Mainoo in to replace him allows that to happen. After praising the academy, Fletcher needs to be bold and give Lacey a start, especially when opportunities are going to be limited for the teenager ahead of Bryan Mbeumo's impending comeback next week.",

      "Darren Fletcher at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Lacey almost scored a winner against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"That's why he's number 61,\" shouted a Burnley fan when Shea Lacey came inches away from scoring a matchwinner for Manchester United. Just minutes earlier, Lacey had smacked the crossbar.",
      "Lacey looked like a player worthy of wearing the famous No.7 shirt in the future when he came off the bench at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. The youngster came close to making a fairytale cameo, but that appearance in Lancashire should only be the start of his next chapter.",
      "Darren Fletcher praised Lacey when he spoke to reporters. \"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that. I know he's gonna make an impact,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game. I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "United have exercised patience with Lacey, who has struggled with muscle injuries, and the youngster deserves credit for staying determined to reach the first-team despite his progress having stalled.",
      "Lacey has been forced to watch as academy peers have been given their debuts over the last 18 months. United wrapped him up in cotton wool to protect him, and that foresight should now pay off.",
      "Lacey came close to scoring against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "The youngster has carried a huge reputation within youth circles since he was a boy. For some, expectation and pressure are too much, but Lacey got his head down and stuck to his task.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",
      "Lacey often took time to take photos with fans at Leigh Sports Village after academy fixtures and signed autographs before leaving the ground. The signature requests might be about to skyrocket this year.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his senior bow against Aston Villa in the Premier League last month, and Tom Heaton gave him words of encouragement as he prepared to come on from the bench.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made a beeline for Lacey when he didn't get a chance to make his debut against Wolves at Molineux. United were leading 4-1, and it felt like the perfect moment for Lacey to come on. However, he had to bide his time and was rewarded at Villa Park just a few weeks later.",
      "Harry Maguire, who is represented by the same agency as Lacey, has also provided the youngster with advice. There is recognition from senior players about his quality and potential.",
      "Fernandes speaks to Lacey at Molineux.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's rare to find someone who was born in Liverpool who supports United, but the youngest of three brothers, Shea is that anomaly. Lacey once had a season ticket at Anfield, but his middle brother, Luis, would complain that he wasn't interested in watching Liverpool.",
      "\"I can’t go from hating Liverpool in the morning when I’m playing against them, to supporting them,\" Lacey told his family, referencing how it felt to represent United's academy.",
      "Lacey's father is the reason he chose to join United's academy over Liverpool when he was just a boy. Shea's oldest brother, Paddy, came through Liverpool's youth system, despite his father telling him that Manchester was the best place for him to develop due to the better coaching.",
      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",
      "\"The shot he did against Burnley, cutting in from the right, all the wonderful coaches who have worked with him down the years, we've seen that strike from Shea a thousand times.",
      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest in Manchester United's search for a new manager on Sunday, January 11.",
      "Ruben Amorim's exit as the head coach of United was officially announced on Monday, leaving the Reds on the hunt for a head coach. Darren Fletcher took charge of Wednesday's draw at Burnley and will oversee today's FA Cup clash with Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Former United striker and boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is one of the favourites to take over at Old Trafford. Alongside Michael Carrick, the club are seeking a short-term fix until the end of the season before appointing someone om a full-time basis.",
      "A permanent appointment is expected to be announced at the end of the season, with several names linked to it. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has been labelled an early favourite, though Eddie Howe has recently been tipped to take over",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Luis Enrique and Marseille's Roberto De Zerbi are also on their radar. No clarity on who will come in for the 2026/27 season is expected until the end of hte season.",
      "Stay here for all of the latest throughout the day, around the appointment of a new manager.",
      "Despite all the noise around Man United and the next manager, there was some good news for whoever takes charge of next week's Manchester derby against Manchester City.",
      "After Bryan Mbeumo's Cameroon crashed out of AFCON on Friday, Amad and Ivory Coast were defeated by Egypt last night. It means that both players will be available against City.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly held face-to-face talks with Man United chiefs on Saturdy as their appointment of a caretaker manager gradually comes close to reaching its conclusion.",
      "Michael Carrick has alrady held talks. It's understood that an appointment is wanted before next week's Manchester derby.",
      "Hello and welcome back to our live blog of everything Manchester United.",
      "It's matchday and Darren Fletcher's men are back in action against Brighton in the FA Cup. There's also news coming out on United's next manager.",
      "Stay tuned and we will bring you everything you need to know on this Sunday morning...",
      "Keane has suggested that Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe offers the ideal mix of experience and composure to take the Msn United forward.",
      "\"He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen with our previous [appointments], we like people with emotions, but he's got that calmness. The job he's done at Newcastle, Champions League and winning a cup, I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "According to The Sun, Jason Wilcox had questioned Amorim's tactics and told him he lacked the pedigree of other coaches under consideration.",
      "It's said that training‑ground sources say Wilcox described himself as 'like a manager' and emphasised that Amorim was the coach. However, it remains unclear whether he said this directly to Amorim during last Friday's infamous meeting, when the Portuguese 'blew up'",
      "But Amorim was made aware of the remarks, prompting his extraordinary outburst after United's 1–1 draw at Leeds, where he insisted on being referred to as the club’s 'manager' rather than 'head coach.'",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (£65m) and Matheus Cunha (£63m) arrived for substantial fees in the summer to fill those roles. However, under Solskjaer, United are likely to take a different approach - a scenario Ineos hadn’t anticipated when signing off on the pair's arrivals.",
      "Solskjaer favoured a wide approach, using both full‑backs in a flat back four and deploying wingers either side of a central striker and a No.10. This preference for wingers continued during his mixed eight‑month spell at Besiktas.",
      "The Norweigian didn't get the players he felt he needed in Turkey, which arguably contributed to his dismissal in August after the Istanbul giants were knocked out in the play‑off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League. Turkish football expert and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit believes Solskjaer was hampered by a lack of quality wide players.",
      "He said the style of play 'wasn’t great,' largely because of the squad's limitations, adding that the football was 'decent at times but never scintillating.'",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him,\" Bayazit added. \"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "There's no reason Mbeumo and Cunha couldn't feature together under Solskjaer, though it's unlikely to be in a dual No.10 system.",
      "Man United hope to make an interim appointment by 'early next week', claims ESPN.",
      "The club are still weighing up who will step in to lead the first team following the departure of Ruben Amorim. United are pressing ahead with plans to appoint an interim coach until the summer before choosing Amorim’s permanent successor, with Michael Carrick and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer both under consideration for the short‑term role.",
      "ESPN add that next week will be crucial for the club. Ruud van Nistelrooy believes he is 'lower down' the shortlist, while Solskjaer has emerged as the favourite to step in and Carrick is also being mentioned prominently.",
      "However, re‑appointing the Norwegian would require rebuilding his backroom staff, as his previous team included Michael Carrick, Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - now the manager of Ipswich Town.",
      "Amad has opened up about the sacking of manager Ruben Amorim, likening the Portuguese to a father figure. \"It was a tough topic,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I was a bit sad, because he's the coach who gave me more visibility and more opportunities to play for Man United. I was very sad. I even sent him a message to thank him for everything he did for me - in my life and especially in my career.",
      "\"I wished him good luck wherever he goes. It was a difficult moment for me, but I'm really focused on Ivory Coast and on this competition. I want to finish well here and try to win this AFCON.",
      "Amad continued: \"We had a very good relationship, almost like a father-and-son relationship. He understood me, and gave me a lot of advice, and let me play freely. It's very unfortunate, but that's life. You have to adapt, that's football.",
      "\"I wish him all the best in life and his next club. My focus is Ivory Coast. I have to give everything for the country.\"",
      "AS Roma director Ricky Massara claims Man United have 'closed off' all transfer talks following the change in manager.",
      "He said: \"At the moment, United have closed off all transfer talks after the change of manager. I doubt they'll change their minds.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had emerged as a potential target for the Italian giants, but a January loan move now appears unlikely due to the club’s managerial situation.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy 'remains in contention' for the Man United job, claims ESPN.",
      "However, sources close to the Dutchman suggest he believes he sits further down the list of candidates.",
      "According to ESPN, one complication in appointing Solskjaer until the end of the season concerns the make‑up of his backroom staff.",
      "The Norweigian is one of the contenders to take over at Man United.",
      "Neville has declared Carlo Ancelotti the outstanding candidate to take over at Man United and would be happy to wait until after the World Cup for the Brazil boss.",
      "\"With the last 12 years being a period of massive underperformance for Manchester United managers, there are certain boxes the next candidate now needs to tick,\" wrote Neville in the Overlap newsletter. \"1. You have to be able to handle the media and the noise that comes with this club. It is what it is so get over it and deal with it. It’s why you’re getting paid the big bucks.",
      "\"2. You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "\"3. You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it’s different to competing in many of the European leagues. 4. You have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1/ 4-2-3-1.",
      "\"You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final. No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically the club met with Carlo shortly before his retirement in 2013 and we could have short circuited this entire process and started with him at the beginning of the cycle.",
      "\"But by that stage he was close to agreeing to joining Real Madrid for his first spell in charge and so what might have been a perfect appointment never happened.\"",
      "The MEN's Manchester Football writer Tyrone Marshall believes McKenna does not have a genuine chance of taking over as manager at Man United.",
      "He said: \"I don't think so, not this time. He was in the conversation in the summer of 2024, when Ten Hag survived by the skin of his teeth, but it would have been a gamble then and would be a gamble now. Ipswich were relegated last season and while that was expected, it is still a mark on his CV.",
      "\"They are third in the Championship and if McKenna can get them promoted again and then enjoy a solid campaign next year, maybe he will be in line for a top job, but handing the United job permanently to someone currently working in the Championship feels a bridge too far.\"",
      "Manchester United-linked Oliver Glasner watched his Crystal Palace side crash out of the FA Cup to non-league Macclesfield on Saturday.",
      "Macclesfield's victory in the third round is being billed as the greatest upset in FA Cup history. The two teams are separated by 117 places in the English football pyramid.",

      "A further blow would see City's Omar Marmoush return as the Egyptians would then have been eliminated.",

      "Fitting £128million worth of talent into the team could be one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first dilemmas if the Norwegian is sworn in as Manchester United boss again.",
      "The club legend is due to hold talks with the club this weekend with a view to taking over for the rest of the season. Michael Carrick is also in the frame to take charge before United appoint a long-term successor to the sacked Ruben Amorim in the summer, when more top-tier managers will be available.",
      "Part of Amorim's downfall was his tactical stubbornness, which led him to persevere with a 3-4-3 formation featuring two No. 10s. Bryan Mbeumo (£65m) and Matheus Cunha (£63m) were signed for big money in the summer to fill those roles.",

      "Read more here",
      "Roy Keane is never short of an opinion on Manchester United and his response to Ruben Amorim's sacking was highly anticipated. \"I'd go Eddie Howe.

He's managed a lot of games, when his teams are at it, they play good football.",

      "\"We've seen the previous manager going in - I like people with emotion, obviously I'm quite an emotional person - but I think his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle, Champions League a couple of times, winning the (League) Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are the frontrunners to assume control until the season's conclusion, with the former scheduled to hold talks on Saturday.",
      "Glasner is among the favourites to secure the position in the summer, having worked wonders at Selhurst Park.

      "In the months leading up to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), Manchester United fans were sweating about how their team would be able to cope without their two big threats on the right side. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo only forged a partnership in the summer, but in the months which followed the duo became pivotal for Ruben Amorim.",
      "As it happens, United have only lost once while the duo have been absent but when Mbeumo becomes the first Red to return to the north west post-tournament, he will find a club unrecognisable from the one he left. Amorim's departure from Old Trafford at the beginning of the week has changed things considerably.",
      "Mbeumo will come back to a United playing a different system with a different coach in the dugout. What will not change though is the Cameroonian's standing in the squad. If fit, there is no question the 26-year-old will return to the starting line-up.",
      "That is why, with Mbeumo coming back, interim head coach Darren Fletcher has an obvious decision to make. In his press conference before this weekend's match against Brighton in the FA Cup, the Scot was asked about the academy and his response was telling.",
      "\"I just think historically, and this club's built around the academy, we've got an amazing academy,\" he said. \"Our record speaks for itself. I'm not going to sit and stand here and say anything other than that. We've got an amazing record. I think it's hard to beat in terms of the history of clubs around the world.

      "If this is truly how Fletcher feels, Lacey must start on Sunday against the Seagulls. When Mbeumo is back in the squad, which he won't be this weekend, the teenager's opportunities will drop off.",
      "Likewise, once Amad is back, Lacey will drop further down the pecking order again. So if Fletcher trusts in the academy and their development, he needs to give a player like Lacey a chance when the opportunity presents itself.",
      "At Burnley on Wednesday night, the 18-year-old only had six minutes to make a point but in that time, he clattered a shot off the crossbar and was lively as the Reds pushed and pushed for a winner. This is the 'United Way' many critics felt Amorim shied away from.",
      "That cameo should be enough for Fletcher to take a gamble and give him that first start. If he doesn't, there's no denying it is a missed opportunity and you have to wonder when Lacey will get his next shot.",

Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Since the summer, Bruno Fernandes has been playing deeper in midfield to make room for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the No.10 roles.",
      "\"I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep, to have more possession, to try to control the game more - and we're doing that,\" Amorim said in September before admitting: \"Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front, maybe because Matheus Cunha was not there.",
      "\"But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player. So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.\"",
      "As Amorim explained, even in the deeper role Fernandes was still influential for the Reds, but there was always the feeling he could offer more if played further forward. In his first game in charge, Fletcher scrapped the Fernandes experiment and put him back into attacking midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes with Darren Fletcher after being substituted vs Burnley(Image: )",
      "Fernandes will always play wherever the manager wants him, but United fans have been crying out for him to play more advanced and despite only just coming back from injury this week, the captain showed why this is a better option for United. Within five minutes of the restart, the 31-year-old produced a sublime through ball for Benjamin Sesko to finish.",
      "Due to his minutes being managed, Fernandes only lasted another ten minutes before being substituted but the promising signs are there. United look a better team when Fernandes is playing behind the striker and considering he scored 19 goals from this role last season, moving him further up the pitch makes sense.",
      "This decision is not just better for Fernandes, it also improves the United squad as a whole. When everyone is back fit and available, Mbeumo can play off the right in a 4-2-3-1 system with Cunha cutting in from the left and Fernandes down the middle.",
      "Those wishing to see more of Kobbie Mainoo will also be pleased. With Fernandes pushed further up-field, Mainoo could slot alongside Casemiro to provide a stronger central midfield partnership. A change to Fernandes' role is best for United, his teammates and the captain.",
      "Fernandes has still been influential in midfield this season, but United look a better team when he's played further forward.",

      "Benjamin Sesko had his best game in a United shirt at Turf Moor(Image: )",
      "Manchester United suffered another setback in the race for Champions League football as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's first game in charge. United started slowly and went behind after 13 minutes. Casemiro was caught out by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's weak attempt at blocking the cross saw the ball loop in off the centre-back.",
      "Fletcher's side soon took control and two Benjamin Sesko goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half looked to have turned it around. He finished smartly from a Bruno Fernandes pass and Patrick Dorgu cross. Somehow, United let the hosts back into it. They had barely threatened in the second half when Lisandro Martinez let Jaidon Anthony turn and deliver a curling finish.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Turf Moor:",
      "Senne Lammens: Decision to try and read the cross from Humphreys not a good one but powerless with the second goal. Good with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Tidy in possession and tried to get forward in the second half, but didn't have much of an impact. United's narrow approach didn't get him much of the ball. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Turned away from the cross that saw the ball loop in off him, when he should have made himself bigger. Aggressive on the ball at times. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: His weakest game since his return to the side. One wild shot and way too passive against Anthony in the area, giving the winger too much space to equalise. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Got forward well and had an impact in that area. Linked well with Dorgu and made some clever runs, both overlapping and underlapping. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Got quite far forward at times, and although his two shots at goal were wayward, he had a solid game and was better with the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro: A shadow of the player who had done so well earlier in the season. Just watched Humphreys run off him for the first goal, was booked and just too slow to react at times. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Picked a brilliant pass to create the equaliser for Sesko and wanted as much of the ball as he could get. Looked a creative force. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Playing everywhere at the moment. Something of a surprise to see him on the left but gave Kyle Walker a hard time and his cross was perfect for Sesko. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Quieter than he has been in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much for being moved centrally. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: His best game for the club. Had plenty of chances, held the ball up well, took his two goals brilliantly and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Another centre-half change. Did fine. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled to match the impact of Fernandes. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Came on in a deep area and tried to get on the ball. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Couple of half chances but couldn't take them. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: So unlucky not to score with a brilliant piece of play. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Maguire, Malacia, J. Fletcher",

      "Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",
      "United have dropped points against the Premier League's bottom seven teams across the last 10 weeks: Tottenham, Bournemouth, Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Burnley and Wolves.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas in August(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "On the mess Solskjaer inherited 12 months ago, following the sacking of Giovanni Van Bronckhorst, Bayazit told MEN Sport: \"It was probably the lowest point I'd seen Besiktas at in my 25 years of following the club. It was a really difficult job to come into.",
      "\"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Solskjaer led Besiktas to some memorable victories(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big games included a win over Galatasaray that preserved a piece of Besiktas history. Bayazit said: \"He's the first manager to win all three big domestic matches in a single half of a season since Besiktas won the league in 2021.",
      "\"He beat Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Galatasray. It was Galatasaray's only loss of the season, which was very significant for Besiktas because they're the only 'Invincibles' in Turkish football history, so beating them was very important.\"",
      "Solskjaer lost his job because of a panicky president, according to Kaan Bayazit(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "However, Solskjaer still didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit is adamant Solskjaer didn't deserve the sack and that he was a victim of a president who caved to media pressure.",
      "\"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs,\" he said. \"I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.' The president has a tenure for three years, then he has to get re-elected, so there is a lot of pressure on them for instant success.",
      "\"But Ole definitely wasn't backed and I would say the Turkish media really had it out for him. Despite the fact he is a model professional and a gentleman, he doesn't leak stuff to the media. He didn't give the media breadcrumbs.\"",
      "Bayazit saw enough of Solskjaer at Besiktas to suggest he is the right short-term option for United following Ruben Amorim's sacking. He added: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"A lot of those players have been told by Ruben Amorim that they aren't good enough. I think that's something Ole will be able to solve short-term.",
      "Solskjaer would help solve some of United's short-term issues, according to Besiktas podcaster Bayazit(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",
      "As a close follower of English football too, Bayazit believes there are similarities between Besiktas and United. He said: \"I've got to know a lot of Manchester United fans recently and the resemblance between them and Besiktas is remarkable, from the state of the squad, backroom politics, the noise around the club, the pressure.",
      "\"That's something people who don't follow Turkish football don't realise. The pressure is so much bigger than 95 per cent of football clubs. Only the biggest clubs in the world know the pressure of the three biggest clubs in Turkey. It's from the fans, the media.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's a regretful that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos. It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. But it got blown up by the president who's very reactionary.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The group have confirmed that demonstrations against the United hierarchy are set to take place ahead of their clash with Fulham on February 1.",

Darren Fletcher has taken charge on an interim basis and oversaw the encounter against Burnley, which finished 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round tie against Premier League rivals, Brighton.",
      "The protest brings fresh pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and now the new-look footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "There is anger among the supporters who they feel like they have been priced out, marginalised and being treated as an inconvenience.",
      "A protest was held at the end of last season, prior to the showdown with Aston Villa, that saw supporters join forces to voice their concerns about the football club after one of their worst campaigns in top-flight history, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",

Statements against the board have already began to emerge and did so during the 2-2 draw at Turf Moor on Wednesday, a banner was unfurled in the away end claiming: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",

      "Amorim faced frequent pressure after failing to heed the downturn in results that led to Erik ten Hag's dismissal. The former Sporting CP head coach has been at the helm for numerous low points during his tenure at the club, including defeat in the Carabao Cup to League Two side Grimsby.",
      "A spokesperson for The 1958 group said: “It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "“A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months’ experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar’s belief.",
      "“This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership.

      "“Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",

      "Shea Lacey produced a thrilling cameo for United at Burnley(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher has backed Shea Lacey to play a \"big part\" in Manchester United's future after the 18-year-old's impressive cameo at Turf Moor in Fletcher's first game in charge. The 18-year-old came on with six minutes to go against Burnley and hit the crossbar with one superb strike before sending another shot from range fizzing just wide of the post.",
      "It was Lacey's second appearance for the first team and the first sign of the talent that has marked him out as one to watch within the academy. Fletcher showed faith in throwing him on as United chased a winner and the youngster almost delivered.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" said Fletcher. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "Lacey's efforts were part of a much better attacking display from United, who had 30 shots against the Clarets. They hit the woodwork twice, had two cleared off the line and saw a Lisandro Martinez goal controversially disallowed for a foul.",
      "Fletcher had told his players to go out and entertain, and he was pleased to see United produce a much better attacking display.",
      "\"It was about them to be proactive, to attack, to go and highlight themselves, go and showcase the abilities they have as individuals and as players and be really front-foot, proactive, exciting,\" he said. \"They were the challenges that we put towards them and they did that.",
      "\"I think, as I said, it wasn't perfect, but there was lots of good things within that. I think if we look back on that game, barring probably the start and then after we went 2-1 up, I think the rest of the game is pretty much total domination and creating lots of chances.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is reportedly being offered an ‘escape route’ from the club with an ’emotional’ component attached.",
      "United have gone through a period of transition of late, but another one might be coming. They accepted that for Ruben Amorim’s project – and 3-4-2-1 formation – to work, they needed to allow him to sign the right personnel.",
      "That meant Patrick Dorgu was signed as a bespoke left wing-back, and wide players who fit into Amorim’s system were signed, in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, along with other additions being made to the squad.",
      "But a year after he was hired, Amorim has been sacked, and the process might start again. United had been looking for a new midfielder prior to that decision being made, and that’s likely to remain the case, meaning a big call could come on one of their existing midfielders.",
      "Casemiro was one of Amorim’s preferred central midfielders, but is out of contract in the summer, and according to Fichajes, has an ‘escape route’ from the club.",
      "Brazilian club Palmeiras are said to have taken a ‘firm step’ with their intentions of signing Casemiro. They are said to want to offer him a two-year contract, feeling this is a key differentiator to other offers he might receive.",
      "What’s more, there is a strong ’emotional component’ to a move to Palmeiras, with Casemiro himself being Brazilian.",
      "He is said to be ‘covering his bases’ in case the new coach to replace Amorim doesn’t want him, suggesting he’s ready to make a move if that is the case.",
      "It seems definite that won’t be happening in January, though, as fellow United player Joshua Zirkzee looked like he could be making his way towards an exit to Roma, before the Italian club’s chief Frederic Massara stated the Red Devils had “closed the door” on January exits after Amorim’s sacking.",
      "Whoever the new boss is will not want to take over a side which has been ransacked in the winter, so the smart call from the United board is to leave everything as is until a new boss is in place.",
      "And there is every chance that Casemiro continues to perform for the next manager and he’s given more time to continue beyond this season, with the option of the further year in his deal being taken.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he substituted Casemiro over other players during their 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Casemiro will have to take a big pay cut if he wants to renew his stay at Old Trafford past this season, according to reports.",
      "With Viktor Gyokeres continuing to struggle for Arsenal, he is among a sextet of Big Six starters doomed for a prolonged snub and/or exit in 2026…",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping their cards close to their chest regarding Casemiro and Harry Maguire, which they are right to do…",
      "Man Utd have made a record-breaking ‘offer’ to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United have “closed the door” on exits after the sacking of Ruben Amorim, according to Roma chief Frederic Massara, who feels it’s “unlikely” a move will happen for a United star now.",
      "There are a few United players who would probably benefit from exits, at least on loan, in January. The pair who spring to mind first are Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, whose roles under Amorim were very limited.",
      "Both have been courted by clubs in the build up to the January window opening, and Roma are the side who were pushing hardest to land Zirkzee.",
      "That push has been ongoing up until recent days, when the sacking of Amorim seems to have thrown things into the air.",
      "Indeed, Roma chief Massara has now said: “Zirkzee? Right now, United have closed off all transfer discussions; it seems highly unlikely to me.”",
      "While Amorim might have been content with Zirkzee leaving the club, whoever follows him through the door might not feel the same way.",
      "United would not want to put a new boss under masses of pressure by leaving him short in one of the more important areas of the pitch.",
      "Currently, Zirkzee is one of only two players capable of playing as the central striker, with Bryan Mbeumo at the African Cup of Nations, though he will soon return after Cameroon were knocked out.",
      "In any case, Mbeumo has been preferred in a wide role at United so far, and No.9 Benjamin Sesko has failed to convince for the most part.",
      "With that said, he scored a brace in the 2-2 draw with Burnley in the week, though those were just his third and fourth goals in a United shirt, and his first since early October.",
      "As such, whoever takes charge of the Red Devils next will surely want to have another option to push Sesko and potentially perform when the Slovenian international isn’t.",
      "There are multiple varying reports suggesting who might be the next United manager. Some outlets have suggested that there is progress being made for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to return in an interim capacity.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is then said to be the ‘heavy favourite’ to take charge in the summer, but his side crashing out of the FA Cup might not help the optics of that move.",

      "Man Utd could reportedly have the chance to do a swap deal involving Joshua Zirkzee and a Roma player as the Serie A side look to speed up the transfer.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is at breaking point with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim looking to sell him ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has hit out at the Red Devils for the “baddest of the bad” display against Wolves as he criticised Ruben Amorim’s substitutions.",

      "The fact the next boss may only be in charge until the end of the season could be a blessing for Glasner, who could polish his image again by then, after his Palace side – holders of the FA Cup – were embarrassingly dumped out by non-league Macclesfield.",

      "The Red Devils are in the process of replacing Amorim, who parted company with the Premier League giants at the start of this week.",
      "Amorim left Man Utd chiefs with little choice but to look elsewhere following a dire 14 months, in which the head coach fuelled shambolic results/performances and refused to alter his system.",
      "Former midfielder Darren Fletcher stepped up from his role with the academy to lead the team in the 2-2 draw against Burnley on Wednesday and he will remain in charge for Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Brighton.",
      "Fletcher is likely to be replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick until the summer, but respected journalist David Ornstein has claimed that Fletcher could still be in the dugout for next weekend’s Manchester derby.",
      "Ornstein told NBC Sports: “Darren Fletcher will take #mufc for at least one more match [vs Brighton], he could even still in position for the next Premier League game [Manchester derby], will have to wait and see.”",
      "READ: Is this the least surprising ‘shock call’ over who Manchester United should appoint as their next manager?",
      "Looking ahead, Neville thinks Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti should be Man Utd’s next permanent boss because he can handle the media, has shown success with a group of superstar players, he understands the Premier League and knows the United way.",
      "“You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes, and as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final,” Neville told The Overlap.",
      "“No one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does.",
      "“Ironically, the club met with Carlo shortly before his retirement in 2013, and we could have short-circuited this entire process and started with him at the beginning of the cycle.",
      "“But by that stage, he was close to agreeing to joining Real Madrid for his first spell in charge, and so what might have been a perfect appointment never happened.”",
      "Alternatively, Neville has explained why he thinks Man Utd should also consider Thomas Tuchel and/or Eddie Howe.",
      "“After Ancelotti, the next two on my short list would be Thomas Tuchel and Eddie Howe, Roy Keane’s suggestion, and one of the names suggested by Ashworth in 2024,” Neville added.",
      "“Again, these are two candidates who know the Premier League inside out and who both have Champions League experience. Howe now has a major trophy as well.",
      "“Obviously, Tuchel edges it in terms of experience and the quality of the trophies he has won, with Champions League, the Bundesliga, and Ligue 1 his biggest achievements.",
      "“He also reached a Champions League final with PSG. He might have played a back three at times, but he is sufficiently adaptable to fit the United DNA and plays with a back four with England.”",
      "Insider Duncan Castles has revealed he once heard that Carlo Ancelotti has always “coveted” the Manchester United job and wanted to take it before he retires.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided who is the ‘heavy favourite’ to be their next permanent manager as they have five ‘top candidates’.",
      "The fury against Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli has been directed back onto Gary Neville for his ‘frankly disgraceful’ and ‘inflammatory’ reaction.",
      "Manchester United reportedly have a new manager at the ‘top of their list’ to replace Ruben Amorim in the summer, while Oliver Glasner has made a ‘demand’.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville hit out at Arsenal summer signing Viktor Gyokeres, who was “really poor” and “offered nothing” against Liverpool.",
      "Gary Neville has furiously criticised “idiot” Gabriel Martinelli over his reaction to Conor Bradley’s horror injury in Liverpool’s 0-0 draw at Arsenal."

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, whose latest crime is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of the boardroom suits. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, and one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",
      "",
      "Spurs were almost entirely awful for all but five great second-half minutes against Aston Villa – and that will keep Thomas Frank in gainful employment.",
      "One Manchester United star is “very sad” at the sacking of Ruben Amorim, as the pair had a relationship “like father and son,” while a report suggests a former Red ...",

      "Thomas Frank has lost another football match while holding an Arsenal cup. Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have made a ‘decision’ on whether to sack head coach Thomas Frank with ‘pressure building’.",
      "A new report has revealed the turning point in the relationship between Ruben Amorim and Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe."

      "The reported plan would be to employ an interim coach until the end of the season before appointing a full-time manager in the summer but Xavi’s current availability may change that.",
      "However, according to Fabrizio Romano, there have been no discussions between the two parties yet with the United hierarchy only having just begun the formal search for a manager.",
      "“At the moment, I am not aware of negotiations between Xavi and Manchester United,” Romano said. “United have now started the process of selecting their coach and we will have to see what can happen in the future. As of today there is nothing advanced or anything concrete.”",
      "However, Xavi is said to be open to a Premier League role and is ready to return to management having been out of the game for 19 months.",

      "A new report has revealed the turning point in the relationship between Ruben Amorim and Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ratcliffe and Man Utd‘s recruitment team have made a lot of wrong decisions since joining the Premier League giants, with Amorim arguably their biggest mistake at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim parted ways with Man Utd on Monday morning, wth his exit a disastrous 14 months in which the Premier League side slumped to embarrassing new lows.",
      "His position at Old Trafford became untenable after he publicly hit out at the club over a transfer disagreement, with the head coach also heavily criticised over his refusal to adapt his formation.",
      "Man Utd’s performances improved as Amorim made changes to his system to get the best out of his squad, but he reverted to type soon after to frustrate supporters and pundits.",
      "READ: Is this the least surprising ‘shock call’ over who Manchester United should appoint as their next manager?",
      "Amorim was doomed to fail for a while, but The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has broken down the events leading up to last week’s infamous meeting between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "“When he [Amorim] reverted to his back 3 against Wolves, who are struggling in form, that was an alarming and concerning development. There were conversations had between all the powerbrokers at United,” Whitwell said on the Talk of the Devils podcast.",
      "“It came ahead at the Friday meeting where Wilcox put points to him, one being that players weren’t on the same wavelength as Amorim and Amorim did not react well to that.”",
      "Whitwell has also shed light on when Ratcliffe’s relationship with Amorim began to change.",
      "“Omar Berrarda was a big advocate for Ruben Amorim coming in, Sir Jim Ratcliffe as well. Ratcliffe had a long, good conversation with Amorim early in the process and was backing him throughout, even when Amorim was questioning his own status,” he continued.",
      "“Ratcliffe started having opinions shall we say about United playing a back four and this is when Jason Wilcox became more forceful in his conversations on that basis.",
      "“Stuff then happened in the Friday meeting where they felt they couldn’t come back from it.”",
      "Regarding former interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, who exited following the arrival of Amorim after a successful stint as interim, Andy Mitten added: “Ruud Van Nistelrooy…there’s some regrets at United that they just let him go. He was very popular.”",
      "They go by a variety of titles but these are the men who carry the clout in the Premier League, the fellas who decide the destiny of your club…",
      "One Manchester United star is “very sad” at the sacking of Ruben Amorim, as the pair had a relationship “like father and son,” while a report suggests a former Red ...",
      "It’s a race between Nuno Espirito Santo and Thomas Frank to see who can get sacked first, but Arne Slot is not too far behind…",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has revealed who he wants to be Ruben Amorim’s permanent replacement at Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Why aren’t Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox falling on their Man Utd sword? The clown club dominate the narrative once again."

      "“I think he would have a go at a lot of players who wouldn’t like to work under him. He would tell them what is right and wrong, because he is very strong minded. He is still my number one choice, but I would be seriously worried. Not because of him but because of the club.”",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has also been linked with Man Utd, but Parker reckons he would be a “terrible solution”.",

The story is basically that Solskjaer had no intention of returning to coaching until actual Manchester United contrived to manufacture a situation of such absurd panic that he became a candidate to take over again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Eddie Howe to succeed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as Gary Neville tells the hierarchy to \"remove the risks\" while citing Thomas Tuchel as the perfect appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked on January 5 with both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick at the forefront of the club's plans to take over on an interim basis, before a permanent successor is named in the summer.",
      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",

      "\"He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen with our previous [appointments], we like people with emotions, but he's got that calmness. The job he's done at Newcastle, Champions League and winning a cup, I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",

      "However, after overseeing a 2-2 draw with Burnley in his first game as interim, Keane was quick to put any talk of a permanent role for Fletcher leading the senior team to an abrupt end.",

      "\"For so long, over 12 years, the football has been really poor. If you think about the appointments over that time, Jose Mourinho is the only one who fits the criteria of the club.",

      "Sunday 11 January 2026 08:14, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",
      "For the neutral, the end-to-end action of the game was a tonic to some of the stop-start, set-piece-heavy offerings served up in the Premier League this season.",
      "The number of goals could easily have been higher. The woodwork was struck three times. There were goalmouth scrambles, goalkeeper saves, last-ditch defensive interventions galore. It was an occasion to savour, albeit not for Leeds fans.Nick Wright",
      "Liam Rosenior will have seen first-hand a major issue for this Chelsea team: a lack of discipline.",
      "Marc Cucurella's red card was as blatant as they come (whether the foul continued into the penalty area and should have been a spot-kick is another debate).",
      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",
      "It's Harry Wilson's world and we're just living in it. \"Right now everything that he touches becomes something magic,\" said his boss Marco Silva, after the Welshman hit Fulham's winner against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "That's nine goal involvements in his past 10 games for Wilson. \"The numbers are top, incredible,\" added the Fulham head coach.",
      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",
      "\"In terms of maturity, decision-making, more calm in some moments - you don't need 100 per cent speed in everything,\" Silva explained.",
      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",

      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "United are sixth in the table on 31 points, three points off fourth-placed Liverpool. They have drawn their last two games against Leeds and Wolves.",
      "The previous meeting between the two sides this season saw Man Utd beat Burnley 3-2 at Old Trafford thanks to Bruno Fernandes' late penalty.",
      "Burnley vs Manchester United in the Premier League takes place on Wednesday January 7 at Turf Moor. Kick-off is 8.15pm UK and Ireland time.",

      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "Man Utd must appoint a manager who fits with their footballing DNA, according to Gary Neville, but would fit the bill? Between the Lines breaks down the side's stylistic profile under Sir Alex Ferguson and ranks the managers whose approaches are most similar",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",
      "Some of the mooted candidates to take over from Amorim sit low in the list too, including Gareth Southgate, Kieran McKenna, Roberto De Zerbi and the Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, suggesting they are not great fits for the club's DNA.",
      "Explore our interactive graphic to see how our selected managers' styles compare to Manchester United's DNA under Ferguson.",
