      "Marcus Rashford has branded Alejandro Garnacho \"my brother\" after the Manchester United star shared a photo of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt with his name and number on it. Both Garnacho and Rashford are expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, with neither player part of Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after he was frozen out by Amorim, while Garnacho was told to find a new club after publicly voicing his frustration at being left out of the starting line-up for the Europa League final.",
      "And Garnacho has raised eyebrows after he shared a series of snaps from his holiday to Ibiza, including one where he is wearing a Villa shirt with 'Rashford 9' on the back. Rashford also commented on the post, simply writing \"My brother\" followed by a love heart emoji.",
      "According to BBC Sport, sources close to Garnacho have claimed that the post is 'merely a supportive one of his team-mate'. It comes after reports claimed that both Rashford and Garnacho are set to be left out of United's pre-season squad if they have not been sold before their trip to the US in July.",
      "Rashford recently spoke out about his future in an interview with Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz, admitting that he would like to play alongside Lamine Yamal at Barcelona. When asked about the prospect of being teammates with Yamal, Rashford replied: \"Yeah, sure.",
      "\"Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see. (Yamal) is gonna be… it's difficult to put into words what he's doing because he's not supposed to be doing it at 16, 17.",
      "\"He's playing at the highest level, I don't think we've seen it. To have his mentality is a skill. He's not normal to be doing what he does and he will keep improving. (The Ballon d'Or) If you look at it in football ability he has to win, but then you look at Ousmane Dembele, the Champions League.",
      "\"Spain is nice, it's not too far from home. If I'm training over a long period, my family can come for a few days, it's a nice location and good weather.\"",
      "And Barcelona's sporting director Deco has previously admitted that the club is interested in Rashford, telling Catalan radio station RAC 1 in May: \"We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players.",
      "\"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",

      "Despite Manchester United having a hefty transfer budget to reclaim their spot amongst England's footballing elite, recruitment has been a significant hurdle. The Red Devils have struggled to maintain consistent success since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but it's not for want of effort.",
      "Without a Premier League title since the 2012/13 season, the club has been on the hunt for that elusive 21st league victory, splashing out colossal sums of money in the process. After cycling through managers like David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho, United entrusted the reins to club icon Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "He made a splash in his first full season, shelling out over £200million on Daniel James, Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Bruno Fernandes. However, it's the five-year period from the summer of 2020 that has seen the club - who've spent over £400m during this time - experience a historic plummet, culminating in their 15th-placed finish last season, their worst league position since the 1973/74 season.",
      "Solskjaer approved the signings of Donny van de Beek, Alex Telles, and Facundo Pellistri in 2020. Van de Beek cost £35m and only played 62 matches for the club before departing for an initial fee of just £423,000 (€500,000).",
      "In his final and most significant transfer window at the club, the Norwegian legend brought Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, splashed out £34million on World Cup champion Raphael Varane, and forked out a staggering £73m for Jadon Sancho. The Englishman arrived with a glowing reputation from his stint at Borussia Dortmund but failed to replicate his German form.",
      "Sancho, 25, eventually fell out of favour with Solskjaer's successor, Erik ten Hag, who relegated him from the first-team in the 2023/24 season. He was subsequently loaned out to Chelsea last season after being deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim and is expected to leave the club once again.",
      "Like Solskjaer, Ten Hag received strong backing in the transfer market as he raided the Eredivisie, signing Tyrell Malacia for £13m and Lisandro Martinez for £46m from his former club Ajax. He also made Antony the second-most expensive player in United's history, spending £81m to secure him.",
      "The Brazilian may have had a promising start, scoring three goals in his first three games, but he managed just nine more goals in his next 93 games, earning him the dishonour of being one of the worst signings in Premier League history.",
      "He was loaned out to Real Betis in January and is likely to be one of the players leaving United permanently. The 2023/24 transfer dealings of United are something they continue to pay the price for.",
      "The big-money signings of Mason Mount (£55m), Andre Onana (£43m) and Rasmus Hojlund (£64m) have all failed to hit the mark, with the striker and goalkeeping positions expected to be bolstered this summer.",
      "Despite United actively searching the managerial market to potentially replace Ten Hag following his FA Cup final victory over Manchester City, he remained at the helm as he once again splashed the cash.",
      "Among the likes of Matthijs De Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, and Leny Yoro, it was the £36m spent on Joshua Zirkzee that left fans feeling deflated after a disappointing debut season at Old Trafford. The forward netted a paltry seven goals, with just three of them coming in the Premier League.",
      "There are several areas Amorim is looking to strengthen and he has filled one void so far after signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves earlier this month. The Portuguese boss is also a huge fan of Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres as he looks to address United's goal-scoring woes.",
      "A replacement for Onana could be in the pipeline this summer in what could turn out to be the most crucial summer in United's recent history - or just another huge dump of money after seeing in excess of £400m go down the drain.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Ralf Rangnick has diagnosed former club Manchester United with a 'leadership problem' which has blighted them for the 12 years post-Sir Alex Ferguson. Rangnick, who's now in charge of the Austrian national team, spent six months as manager at Old Trafford in the 2021-22 season, arguably their most underwhelming Premier League campaign to date.",
      "With Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line, Paul Pogba in midfield and Raphael Varane at the back, big things were expected after a second-place finish the previous term. But neither Rangnick or his predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, were able to find a winning formula, as the Red Devils slumped to sixth.",
      "The plan was for Rangnick, 66, to become a consultant following the end of his six-month spell as interim boss. But when Erik ten Hag was appointed in April 2022, United abruptly cut ties with the acclaimed German coach, who's renowned as one of the great minds of the modern game.",
      "Rangnick had been openly critical of the regime at Old Trafford, infamously insisting that the squad needed 'open heart surgery' during one of his many sobering press conferences. In the three years since his departure, the former Schalke, Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig manager - nicknamed the 'Godfather of the Gegenpress' - has continued to point of United's flaws.",
      "Despite the club's hierarchy undergoing a seismic change over the last 18 months, prompted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's partial takeover, Rangnick still believes that the Red Devils lack a proper leadership structure. It's an issue which he believes stems from the moment Ferguson retired after 26 highly successful years.",
      "\"I think we have to go back to 2013, when Sir Alex left the club,\" Rangnick told Spanish outlet Sport. \"And at the time he was still there, he was the mastermind behind it all. He probably also brought a lot of important people to the club.",
      "\"And the moment he left, some of those people probably left the club as well. And, since then, I think they have a leadership problem. Who's really making the decisions and why are they making them? Are they really the best people for the job? I can only tell you that the six months I was there, it was difficult to say, even for me as head coach.",
      "\"Who were the decision makers? Who? Who could I talk to? If we wanted to sign new players, it was difficult. There were people, but in the end, it was difficult.\"",
      "So, what advice would Rangnick give United's current regime led by new CEO Omar Berrada, sporting director Jason Wilcox and Ratcliffe's INEOS bigwigs? \"If I were the owner or sporting director of a club, I would only try to sign and invest in young players. Because no matter how you look at it, it only makes sense,\" the Austria boss explained.",
      "\"Does it make sense to spend 30, 40, 50 million on a 28 or 30-year-old signing? Not really. Let's calculate it: You sign a 28 or 30-year-old with a five-year contract; you spend 50 million more on the transfer fee; an average of 15 million euros per year multiplied by five.",
      "\"That's 65 million plus the 50 million transfer fee, equals 115 million plus the agents' fees. The whole operation costs you around 130 million.\""

They have also got Crystal Palace star Eze on their list of potential targets and are long-time admirers of the England international.",

      "Chelsea midfielder Dario Essugo has revealed his huge debt of gratitude to Ruben Amorim. It was the Manchester United boss who gave Essugo’s career lift-off when they were together at Sporting Lisbon and made him one of Europe’s most sought after young players.",
      "Former Sporting boss Amorim gave Essugo his debut in the Champions League when he was just 16 years and 268 days, making him the Portuguese club’s youngest debutant in the competition.",
      "Essugo, 20, joined Chelsea in the summer for £18.5m and will always be grateful for Amorim for putting him in the first team after just ONE training session. Portugal under-21 star Essugo said: “He brought me to the first team so he helped me a lot, to understand the game, to reach the level I am here now.",
      "“I am grateful. He is so demanding. He is a demanding person. He likes to win every time so he has helped me a lot. I made one training session with the first team and the coach Ruben Amorim likes what he saw and he called me to play.",
      "“I didn’t expect to play because at this time there was Covid and I wasn’t playing anything because the Champions League had stopped. We had good players like Manuel Ugarte, João Palhinha and now Morten Hjulmand.",
      "“They are three big players. I had the opportunity to learn with one of them and of course this for me was a big opportunity.”",
      "Essugo says he learned a lot from those players and Amorim but also wants to be his own man rather than be compared to players like Claude Makelele or Michael Essien and N’Golo Kante who have obvious similarities.",
      "He said: “To be honest, I never saw Makelele on TV but the people told me a lot about Makelele and say I have some similar parts of his game. They are big players. I want to make my own way but also like to see Makelele, Essien and Kante, to follow their steps.",
      "“I always play as a midfielder but also I am a defensive midfielder but I also like to go forward with the ball, box to box. Of course it is good when they compare you with a very big player but it is a mix of both because I want to try to have my way, to achieve the top.”",
      "And when Chelsea came calling this summer, there was never any doubt in Essugo’s mind about where to go. His dad now manages his career after a career in construction while his mum works in a kitchen.",
      "Now Essugo wants to cook up something special at Stamford Bridge and says Enzo Maresca has also been hugely positive since he arrived. He added: “Chelsea helped my parents so many times. I feel very good. When my father said Chelsea want me to come here, of course I can’t say no.",
      "“I am learning with the coach, the players, the midfielders here. Enzo has a different idea of football like all the managers. But I always to try catch what he wants. Romeo Lavia is so calm I learn so much from him.",
      "“It is a different level. The players are amazing. Before, when I was at Las Palmas and Sporting, they had very big players but for me it is an amazing feeling to be here.”",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe took his initial 27.7percent share of Manchester United, the top line was that he would be taking charge of football operations. Turns out ‘football operations’ included sacking office staff and giving ticket prices a hike after a season that included EIGHTEEN Premier League defeats.",
      "And just for effect, news of the increases came on a day when the fixtures for the next Premier League season were published - a day that should be about hope and optimism and about wiping the slate clean. Increasingly, Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group are becoming the embodiment of people who know how to make billions out of business but are clueless when it comes to winning the hearts of minds of a football club’s fanbase.",
      "Perhaps they are not overly interested in hearts and minds, perhaps they really are only interested in money. After all, it will take many, many more years - possibly decades - of underachievement on the field of play before United loses its allure as one of sport’s most iconic institutions.",
      "That might be a hard notion for rival supporters to stomach but that is fact. United could probably double ticket prices and still sell Old Trafford out.",
      "The crowd’s demographic would be different - there would be a lot of tourists around - but they would still fill the stadium. And they would probably fill a new one seating 100,000.",
      "But these ticket prices are not particularly jaw-dropping in scale, to be honest. The Manchester United Fans’ Advisory Board even said: “We are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.”",
      "But that same group had called for a ticket-price freeze that they “felt was justified due to the current circumstances.” And that is the point.",
      "After the season United had - ending in the dismal Europa League final defeat - asking fans to pay more for the privilege of watching a strictly mediocre team almost smacks of having a laugh at the supporters’ expense. It smacks of doing it because they know they can.",
      "It is common for clubs, for ticket pricing purposes, to categorise games, but on the evidence of their performances at Old Trafford last season, is ANY game involving this United side a Category A match? But there are six Category A games at Old Trafford next season - against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur - and tickets for those fixtures range from £59 to £97.",
      "No matter what your take on the scale of the increases - and United are certainly not the only club to do this - it is the fact the increases come against a backdrop of players under-performing hugely for hugely over-inflated salaries. It comes against a backdrop of the Glazers having taken out millions and millions in dividends over the period of their ownership.",
      "And it is simply hard to believe that, as a nod towards United’s fantastic support, the club and Sir Jim and INEOS could not have stood a season in which ticket prices remained the same. Actually, scrap that.",
      "It is not hard to believe. It is easy. Because these people know a lot about business but little about being a football fan.",

His dream move to Barcelona may now be off the cards - despite his thinly-veiled come-get-me-plea - and the forward appears to be selling himself as the central striker that United are looking for.",
      "Rashford has played predominantly from out wide during his career, but believes becoming a central option has been part of his career evolution. Those in Manchester have missed out on Liam Delap, one of their summer targets, whilst Viktor Gyokeres may favour other destinations.",
      "It could yet leave an opening for Rashford to stake his claim as the man to lead United's line - something he believes he's now capable of. He said: \"For me as I've got older, the No.9 position is becoming more comfortable, more natural.\"",
      "In Rashford's most prolific season he scored 30 times. That was back in 2022/23 under Erik ten Hag. He's failed to hit those heights since but looked back to his best for periods during his loan spell at Villa, where he was able to dislodge Ollie Watkins as a stater.",
      "The main task for the academy graduate will be winning over Amorim. The Portuguese coach, who has signed Matheus Cunha and now wants Bryan Mbeumo, quickly shunned Rashford when he arrived and left him out of numerous squads. He later cited a difference of opinion as their main issue.",
      "He said: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it.

I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",

So far, United have seen two offers turned down by the London club, while Tottenham - who have just poached Bees boss Thomas Frank - have made a bid in excess of anything offered by United.",

The Portuguese is sticking wholeheartedly with his 3-4-3 formation which is yet to bear fruit in Manchester, with the pair both set for starting spots as the twin No.10s, either side of a No.9.",
      "That means that Amad, one of few shining lights during a dismal 2024-25 campaign is likely to miss out on his preferred position on the right of the attacking trio. He may well have to drop back and play at wing-back if he wants to keep a starting spot, or else be a substitute.",

      "Hojlund's commitment to fulfilling his contract and potential under Amorim means a departure is not a given, particularly when sellable assets such as Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony actively want out.",

      "United are hoping to bring in a fee for the former Ajax winger to boost their funds this summer, with the club requiring £32.58million to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules. That figure is well short of the £85m United spent in 2022.",
      "Antony failed to make an impression following Ruben Amorim's arrival but found a new lease of life in Spain after making a loan move to Betis in January. The Brazilian registered 14 goal contributions in 26 games to help the club reach the Conference League final.",

      "Continuing to praise Yamal, Rashford said: (Yamal) is gonna be… it's difficult to put into words what he's doing because he's not supposed to be doing it at 16, 17. He's playing at the highest level, I don't think we've seen it. To have his mentality is a skill.",

      "It is so partisan that Florentino Perez, the Real Madrid president, used it as his platform to plug the Super League. Perez described Madrid as \"broke\" and went unchallenged. Months later, they bought Aurelien Tchouameni for €80million.",
      "The programme is live and much of it is undoubtedly scripted but it is not a parody. When Kylian Mbappe had the temerity to reject Madrid in 2022, José Félix Díaz, of Marca, turned to the camera and addressed Mbappe directly: \"You'll be a great player, but never a great man.\" Tomas Roncero vented that Mbappe must \"swallow the Eiffel Tower\" to ever play for Madrid.",
      "English football coverage is better off without its own El Chiringuito. You wonder how Marcus Rashford, who floated the possibility of playing at Barcelona in a chat with a Spanish influencer, would cope with the show's Catalan contingent if his body language regresses.",
      "Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have become content-creation collaborators in the Manchester United departures' lounge. United still pay their wages but they brazenly undermined their employers with a choreographed stunt on Sunday.",
      "Rashford was injured for that humbling at Wembley but was present at the boxing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later that evening. We are long past the point where Rashford cared about the optics of his social life. He attended a birthday party on Deansgate hours after he was cheered off in a 3-0 Manchester derby defeat at Old Trafford.",
      "Any notion that Garnacho's post was not choreographed beggars belief. You can tell when he is uploading onto his Instagram page (his passive-aggressive pre-Europa League final story and return from the post-season tour).",
      "The other giveaway is Rashford's use of the word \"brother\" in the comments. It is the most hollow and meaningless noun in football. Rashford and Garnacho have only ever socialised during team-bonding dinners.",
      "Garnacho and Rashford rarely linked up on the pitch, never mind off it. Garnacho pinched Rashford's place on the left wing. One of Rashford's inner circle dubbed him a \"f*****g Ronaldo wannabe\". Now they are \"brothers\".",
      "In all probability, neither player literally posted or commented. Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, accidentally sent a tweet intended for Rashford's Twitter account from the DN May Sports agency he runs in September 2021. Having interviewed Rashford, a thoughtful talker, his often banal captions never sound like something he would ever say.",
      "Maynard was summoned to United's Carrington training complex after Rashford's Belfast bender in January 2024. They know their race is run at United but it is still unedifying to see a player who joined the club's academy 20 years ago publicly stoop to such a petty low.",
      "Garnacho's own advisers, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, have succeeded and failed with the Argentine. They have a client whose value was listed in excess of £100m last year but literally leave Garnacho to his own (smartphone) devices.",
      "He is a loose cannon, regularly sounding off on social media, and failing to gag his lippy brother. Cambeiro and De Lucas are part of the problem. They let the world know they were at Stamford Bridge in January, when Chelsea were giving serious consideration to bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho turns 21 next week yet acts like the finished article. He is finished at United and, in his desperation, has found an ally in Rashford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both lucratively remunerated in 2023. Garnacho kicked on. It kicked off with Rashford. They had little in common other than their position until they irked Amorim in Plzen back in December.",
      "They were close on the morning of December 15, when both were training at Carrington having been dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby. Garnacho, to his credit, went in one direction and played in every remaining match last season bar the final day win over Villa. Rashford decided on a change of scenery.",
      "It is particularly sobering for United that the two upstarts are academy products that represent the best of both worlds. The local lad and the gem unearthed from abroad.",
      "Some in the United academy can be quick to pat themselves on the back when there is a history of some of their most talented products posing problems, from the frivolous to the serious. The academy cannot parent a player throughout their career or be held completely accountable, but it is cause to take stock.",
      "The brazenness of Garnacho's post and Rashford's comment is a throwback to Paul Pogba - another academy graduate - revelling in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter with his 'Caption this' post. Pogba was never disciplined over that.",
      "United resisted selling Pogba, tolerated the late Mino Raiola declaring \"it's over\" for him on the eve of a decisive Champions League tie at RB Leipzig (that United lost) and released him. The Stretford End repeatedly chanted \"F**k off, Pogba\" after he was substituted against Norwich City in April 2022. He did. Pogba never played at Old Trafford again.",

      "Few players have divided opinion at Manchester United in recent years as much as Scott McTominay did.",
      "The Scotland international, now of Napoli, often left supporters split when voicing their opinions of him and the role he played at Old Trafford.",
      "But after he had plundered a respectable tally of ten goals during the 2023/24 campaign, United were left with an important decision to make. He had just one year remaining on his contract campaign and it meant United had to decide whether to cash-in or attempt to tie him down to a new deal.",
      "Much to the disappointment of former United manager Erik ten Hag, United decided to cash-in, selling him to Napoli on deadline day last August. United pocketed a fixed fee of £25.7million and from a financial viewpoint it made perfect sense.",
      "He had just under a year remaining on his contract at the time of the deal going through and his stock was high after a fruitful 2023/24 campaign. Furthermore, the £25.7m United banked for him counted as 'pure profit' under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "\"I'm very happy for him and it's also for us, but it's mixed, because I wouldn't prefer to lose him, because he is Man United in every vein,\" Ten Hag said of McTominay's departure. \"He was so important for our team, for Manchester United.",
      "\"He was here for over 22 years. Unfortunately, it's the rules. We have to discuss the rules when you have to do sells and then, obviously, homegrown players, Academy players, they bring more value.\"",
      "After scoring 13 goals and helping Napoli win a second Serie A title in three seasons in his debut season in Italy, United's decision to sell the Scotsman has naturally been called into question. Had he, for example, scored two goals in his maiden season in Naples, nobody would have battered an eyelid.",
      "Taking his contract situation, the landscape of United's midfield options and the financial package on offer, United were right to sell McTominay when they did. His stock was at an all-time high and United had previously been criticised for turning down enterprising offers for players who could leave for free further down the line.",
      "However, despite often splitting opinion, McTominay could often be relied upon to provide a goal from midfield. He regularly made box-crashing runs to put himself in the conversation to get on the end of a cross.",
      "He was better in attack-minded positions than being a defensive-minded No.6, and his form in his first season at Napoli demonstrated that.",
      "United were unable to replace the goals McTominay had provided in 2023/24 last season, meaning there is an argument for them to target a goalscoring midfielder this summer. United want to recruit a midfielder this summer amid doubts about Manuel Ugarte's ability in possession.",
      "However, having already completed the signing of Matheus Cunha, who is expected to take up residency in the left-sided No.10 position, Bruno Fernandes is poised to make the centre of midfield a permanent home next season. He often dropped deeper in the second half of last season and he did score eight times and rack up seven assists when playing as one of the two No.8s.",
      "As a result, Fernandes, who is a seasoned goalscorer and creator, will be able to provide a goalscoring threat from the engine room. Technically, however, he is not a direct replacement for McTominay.",
      "Nevertheless, the addition of Cunha should make up for Fernandes being forced to drop into a deeper role. United also want to sign Bryan Mbeumo, who got 20 Premier League goals last season, meaning the prospect of him and Cunha making up two thirds of United's attack would make up for any shortfall amid Fernandes being set to become a permanent No.8.",
      "The United captain regularly made things happen from a deeper position last term, so much so the team often looked better when he played deeper. The No.8 role allows him to dictate proceedings and read of the game.",
      "Provided Fernandes is deployed alongside a midfield partner of the right profile, he should be given the license to get forward and occupy attacking positions in and around the opposition penalty area.",
      "The addition of Cunha and possible arrival of Mbeumo would make up for losing a box-crashing, goalscoring midfielder of McTominay's ilk, meaning it ought not to be a big issue like it was last season.",
      "Whatever you made of McTominay, his goals were not replaced last term."

      "Defenders Noussair Mazraoui, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt all arrived before the start of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, before defensive-midfielder Manuel Ugarte checked in from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day.",
      "There was no denying United's defence and the base of their midfield needed strengthening after they had conceded 58 times in the previous league campaign, but to only sign Joshua Zirkzee to strengthen their attack was a disaster waiting to happen.",
      "Zirkzee, who quickly demonstrated he was not the out-and-out No.9 United were in desperate need of last summer, had scored just 12 goals for Bologna in 2023/24. He was by no means an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who had plundered a respectable 16 goals in his debut campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "As a result of failing to beef up their attack, United's output decreased last season, resulting in them scoring a paltry 44 league goals. They conceded 54 to ensure they recorded a negative goal difference ten times bigger than the one they had registered 12 months earlier.",
      "It is unforgivable for a club of United's stature to record a negative goal difference for two league campaigns running. For context, their tally of 101 league goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign is only 15 fewer than what champions Liverpool scored on their way to winning the title in 2024/25.",

      "Twelve months on, United are in the process of trying to make up for last summer's misjudgements. Matheus Cunha, fresh from scoring 17 goals for Wolves in all competitions last season, has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and United remain determined to add Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo to their ranks.",
      "The Cameroonian, 25, plundered 20 Premier League goals last season, marking his best ever return in front of goal in a single season. Cunha scored 15 times in the league last term, meaning they were both among the division's top eight goalscorers last term.",
      "Both players, as has been documented countless times in recent weeks, are Premier League proven and have respectable records in the English top flight. Cunha has been signed to occupy the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and Mbeumo could operate from either the right-sided No.10 position or right wing-back.",
      "It should be stressed United are yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Mbeumo, who was the subject of a £55m bid from the Reds earlier this month, but they are still hopeful of making a breakthrough. He has informed confidants he wants to move to M16 this summer.",
      "If United are successful in their efforts and Mbeumo is extracted from the Gtech Community Stadium, they will be two thirds of the way towards fixing their attack, with the addition of a centre-forward still a leading priority.",
      "After getting a deal in place for Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window (June 1), United immediately increased expectation levels, meaning supporters would have hoped for more deals to follow quickly.",
      "The news vacuum of the past week or so, however, has highlighted that was never likely to be the case. Patience will be key.",
      "The transfer window can be tricky to navigate, particularly in its early stages, and the upcoming profit and sustainability rules (PSR) deadline of June 30 is undoubtedly playing on the minds of several clubs.",
      "But having signed Cunha, lodged a bid for Mbeumo and expressed their hunger to sign Liam Delap prior to him settling on a move to Chelsea, United have not lacked ambition at the start of the window. They want to move at speed and make up for last summer's mistakes."

      "\"We're buying [Jadon] Sancho this summer, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana.",
      "\"It's not a light switch. In your day [Neville's], you bought a player and that was it. I know that the bill we will pay this summer is £89m for players that have been signed previously. If we buy no players, we write a cheque for £89m this summer.\"",
      "Having rejected United's opening offer of £55m for Mbeumo, it is understood Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the one Wolves banked for Cunha. Talks between United and Brentford remain ongoing and there is a growing belief an agreement will eventually be reached.",
      "The likelihood is, though, that United will have to pay a fee in the region of £60m to extract the Cameroonian from the Gtech Community Stadium, meaning the deal, taking into account the £89m owed elsewhere, could take United's spending to just north of £210m.",
      "Considering head coach Ruben Amorim also wants to add a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer, it highlights just how important player sales are for United between now and the 7pm deadline on September 1.",
      "Failure to qualify for next season's Champions League means revenue streams will be not as lucrative as they would have otherwise been in 2025/26, meaning United must be shrewd with their recruitment. They have already had to break their own rule of not going above £60m for a player and they may have to do it twice more this summer to get Mbeumo and the centre-forward they so desperately crave.",
      "Rashford, who spent the second half of the season at Aston Villa, is valued at £40m, Sancho, who is no longer joining Chelsea on a permanent basis, is available for somewhere in the region of £20m and Antony, who impressed at Real Betis, needs to be sold for £32.58m to ensure United avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "If United sell the trio at their respective asking prices, they will bank £92.58m to cover the £89m owed to other clubs this summer. However, offloading each member of the aforementioned trio is going to be an easier said than done task.",
      "United could be forced to send the England international out on loan for the second season running and that is a situation both the club and Rashford will want to avoid. Sancho, too, could also be difficult to offload.",
      "His wages could be problematic for any suitor, even if the transfer fee itself might not be too much of a struggle. Napoli are reputedly keen on Sancho, who is out of contract next summer, but they are said to be reluctant to meet his wage demands, according to reports in Italy.",
      "With that in mind, United's hopes of generating useful sums of money for two of their three wantaway players may not be so easy, meaning it could be even more of a struggle to fund new signings and cover the £89m owed on deals from previous years."

      "One of the biggest problems Manchester United experienced last season was a lack of consistency.",
      "Every time it felt as though United had taken one step forward, they immediately took two steps back. The biggest example of that was when they beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium in December and then lost their next four games.",
      "United failed to win back-to-back Premier League games at any point last season, meaning they last achieved that particular feat in May 2024. They most recently won back-to-back games across all competitions in March.",
      "A lack of consistency was a major problem for the Reds last season, both collectively and individually. With the exception of Bruno Fernandes and Amad, they struggled to get a regular tune out of anyone.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, for example, scored five goals in his first fives games under Ruben Amorim, meaning it felt as though he was going to overcome his slow start to the season and eat into the 16-goal haul he recorded in his first season at Old Trafford.",
      "But after a double helped United come from behind to beat Viktoria Plzen 2-1 in the Europa League on December 12, he then went 21 games without a goal, not getting himself on the scoresheet again until United's 3-0 win over Leicester City on March 16. He then went another six games before scoring again for the Reds.",
      "In desperate need of consistency, both collectively and individually next season, United will be unable to rely on the Dane to provide them with the regular goal-threat they will be in need of.",
      "And that is why their pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo makes such perfect sense. United are keen to bring the Cameroonian to Old Trafford and have already seen a £55million offer knocked back.",
      "United offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons. It is understood Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the £62.5m United paid for Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "When analysing Mbeumo's numbers from the 2024/25 campaign, however, Brentford's stance is fully understandable. He scored 20 Premier League goals last term, only being outscored by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (29), Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak (23) and Manchester City ace Erling Haaland (22).",
      "Consistency was key to Mbeumo's achievement of reaching 20 Premier League goals, with his longest drought in front of goal amounting to only five games on a single occasion. That barren run covered the start of November through to the start of December.",
      "With the exception of that blip, Mbeumo never went more than three Premier League games without a goal during the campaign. Reflecting on his season's work, he admitted consistency was key to his success.",
      "\"Consistency is really important,\" Mbeumo said, speaking to BBC Sport Africa last month. \"If you want to have big ambitions you need to perform the whole season.",
      "\"I think I am still improving every day I put a foot on the pitch. I never put limits on myself.\"",
      "United's attack has been starved of a consistent goalscorer in recent seasons, meaning supporters will be hopeful, should a deal get over the line, that Mbeumo will be able to fix that particular concern.",
      "United are not trying to sign Mbeumo to lead their attack, with the addition of a No.9 still a leading priority, but they will be hopeful the Cameroonian's reliability will give them an extra shot in the arm."

      "Manchester United should keep Amad Diallo at Old Trafford this summer, despite striking a transfer agreement for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, according to former striker Louis Saha.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, is said to have approved a move to United, with negotiations ongoing to settle on a transfer fee, after a £45million plus £10m offer arrived from Ruben Amorim's side earlier this month. Tottenham and Thomas Frank have made a late attempt to sign him, but United are expected to eventually seal a move.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already joined in a £62.5m deal from Wolves and is set to be used as one of Amorim's attacking midfielders in the 3-4-3 system. Mbeumo, meanwhile, specialises on the other side, meaning that Amad might have to drop down as the right wing back or as a substitute in their first-choice starting XI.",
      "Since news of a move for Mbeumo emerged, speculation has increased that Amad could therefore leave United. However, Saha has urged United to keep hold of the Ivorian as he is one of two players that cannot be sold.",
      "\"Nooo! No! No! If there are one or two players who should not leave, it is him and Bruno Fernandes,\" Saha told the Daily Express with BetSelect. \"He is the kind of player who does not care where he plays. He has said it himself; he will play as a left-back or centre-back - he will just play.\"",
      "Saha then decided to aim fire at Amad's teammates, admitting that unlike the former Sunderland loanee, others throw their weight around about the position they play.",
      "He continued: \"Some other players will say, 'I want to play there' or 'I should be playing [in] this [position]'. Those players should shut up. Why? Because the result that we had last year is ridiculous.",
      "\"If you have got 20 goals, you can ask those things, maybe. But none of those players have scored more than 15 goals, and they are asking for things. It is crazy.\"",
      "Amorim is set to oversee an attacking overhaul this summer, with Cunha, Mbeumo and a new No.9 coming through the doors, while there are several players that are expected to depart. They include Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho - with all three spending time out on loan last season."

      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has issued a wordless message as speculation continues to grow around his future. Sancho, 25, spent last season on loan at Chelsea but, despite having a £25million obligation to make the move permanent, the Blues decided to pay a £5m penalty fee to send him back to M16.",
      "However, the former Borussia Dortmund man is still not expected to have a long-term future under Ruben Amorim and anticipated to leave United once again. Napoli are reportedly among those interested in Sancho, who is reported to be willing to accept a move to Italy, even if he has to reduce his salary demands.",
      "United want to secure a similar fee to the one that was agreed with Chelsea - in the region of £25m - despite his disappointing spell in west London. Sancho scored five goals and provided 10 assists in 41 matches for the Blues, who ended the season winning the Conference League and finishing in the top four.",
      "Napoli are the team that are out in front right now according to Sky Sport Italy, which claims that Sancho's preference is to join Antonio Conte's side, as they were the first side to express an interest this summer. He has seen his former teammate Scott McTominay flourish out in Naples, having won Serie A's Most Valuable Player award.",
      "While Sancho's long-term future remains up in the air, he has been spotted working hard in preparation for pre-season, as he tries to revitalise his career after a mixed season.",
      "In an Instagram story in the early hours of Sunday morning, Sancho posted a picture of him in the gym but blocked his face with an emoji (anxious face with sweat). The image was shared without a caption.",
      "United are set to return to training at the start of next month ahead of the 2025/26. Whether Sancho is present at their first day of pre-season remains to be seen, as speculation over his future continues.",

He brought Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan in 2019, as well as signing Ashley Young and Alexis Sanchez from United."

      "In April 2005, Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren, etched his name into the Wrexham history books.",
      "After Spanish forward Juan Ugarte had fired the Welsh outfit into a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute of extra-time of the 2005 EFL Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium, Ferguson added a second with two minutes left on the clock. It clinched Wrexham their first and only EFL Trophy crown to date.",
      "Celebrating with his teammates as his father watched from the stands, little did one of Ferguson's colleagues know Sir Alex had been impressed by his performance. The man in question was former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster.",
      "Foster was on loan at Wrexham from Stoke City, having joined on an initial month's loan in January that year. The deal was eventually extended until the end of the season.",
      "No doubt to Foster's disbelief, he returned to Stoke after the conclusion of his loan spell at the Racecourse Ground and was sold to United in July, signing for a reported fee of £1million. Ferguson was impressed by what he had seen from the shot-stopper when watching him play alongside his son.",
      "Foster, who was 22 at the time, made the switch to Old Trafford without having made a single first-team appearance during his four-year spell at Stoke, which featured a catalogue of loan moves. The goalkeeper soon added another loan spell to his collection, being shipped out to Championship side Watford for the 2005/06 season, making 48 appearances as they clinched promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Watford borrowed him again the following season, giving him a full season's worth of Premier League football that featured him infamously being beaten by Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson from a free-kick around 75 yards from goal. Despite being powerless to stop Watford from suffering an immediate return to the second tier, 29 Premier League appearances served him well.",
      "Back at United, the 2007/08 campaign was nothing more than a write-off for the goalkeeper, with a serious injury restricting him to just one appearance. That one outing, however, saw him mark his United debut with a clean sheet in a 1-0 away win at Derby County. United won the Premier League title that season, but in making just one appearance, he did not qualify for a medal.",
      "The following season, Foster did experience the buzz of having a winner's medal draped around his neck while donning United colours. He won the Man of the Match award as the Reds beat Tottenham Hotspur on penalties in the 2009 League Cup final at Wembley.",
      "After a goalless 120 minutes United prevailed on spot kicks, winning 4-1. Foster saved one penalty, thwarting Jamie O'Hara with what was Spurs' first penalty of the shootout.",
      "United and Foster were back at Wembley again for the 2010 League Cup final 12 months later. On that occasion, however, Foster watched from the bench as Tomasz Kuszczak started between the sticks, helping United come from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1.",
      "Foster had played once on the road to Wembley, keeping a clean sheet in a 2-0 away win at Barnsley in the fourth round, meaning he secured a second League Cup winner's medal. He featured more prominently for United that season, earning 13 appearances.",
      "Despite helping United win two League Cup crowns in as many seasons, Foster never felt comfortable at Old Trafford, so much so that he admitted last year he \"hated every second\" of his time at the club.",
      "\"It was at a time in my life, mid-20s, 24, 25, I look back at that person who played for United then, and it's not me,\" he revealed, speaking to talkSPORT. \"I was so wet behind the ears, I didn't understand how anything worked in life.",
      "\"But I did [suffer from impostor syndrome]. I hated every second of it. I didn't enjoy it. I was nervous, I was petrified of making a mistake, petrified of what the outside world would say about it.",
      "\"That's a bad way to go about it. When you go into games thinking the worst, or fearing the worst, you're off to a bad start straight away. I'd look around at some of these big names behind me and think, 'how have I got here?'.\"",
      "After clasping his hands on the League Cup for a second time, Foster, who made 23 appearances for United in total, departed Old Trafford on a permanent basis in May 2010, joining Birmingham City. It was an opportunity for him to earn regular football.",
      "Spending just one season at St Andrew's, Foster helped Birmingham beat Arsenal 2-1 in the 2011 League Cup final, with Obafemi Martins famously scoring a last-gasp winner. It marked Foster's third League Cup triumph.",
      "Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League a few months later, meaning Foster moved on and joined West Bromwich Albion, initially on a season-long loan deal. He ended up spending seven years at The Hawthorns, making more than 200 appearances.",
      "A four-year return to Watford followed, ahead of Foster deciding to hang up his boots in September 2022. However, he was tempted out of retirement by Wrexham in March 2023, helping them end their 15-year absence from the Football League by saving a penalty in stoppage time to secure a 3–2 win over Notts County, which helped them move three points clear at the top in the race for promotion.",
      "Having played non-league football at the beginning of his career, it was somewhat fitting that his last career highlight was a historic penalty save that helped Wrexham escape the clutches of non-league football.",
      "Despite what Foster made of his time at United, nobody can ever take those League Cup winner's medals away from him, nor that penalty save at Wembley to deny O'Hara."

      "Tom Heaton is also on it. At the time of the interior decoration, all four were United first team squad members. Three still are, technically, but Heaton is likely to be the only one remaining come the end of summer.",
      "In the main building, there are young and old images of past graduates. Dean Henderson is one of the most recent, a success story for the United academy but not at United.",
      "United's outgoing academy director Nick Cox celebrated Henderson's man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final on X. Henderson was, briefly, United's first homegrown No.1 since Gary Walsh. The chances of an academy talent making the grade at United are more remote than for those in any other position.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "Cox always accepted goalkeepers were a conundrum. Enough were needed to play, train and cover the first team, so a minimum of six were needed in the junior teams. United relish emergency loan calls from clubs for goalkeepers as Henderson's first career appearance was as an emergency loanee at non-league Stockport County in 2016.",
      "The image of Henderson can still motivate the incumbent academy custodians. Henderson has won the FA Cup, will be playing in Europe next season and there are whispers he could supplant Jordan Pickford as the England No.1.",
      "\"We take great pride in seeing our boys have great careers away from here,\" Cox said. \"If we hinged everything on who crosses the white line (for United), we'd all be miserable.\"",
      "Cox's work at United is done and he will move to Everton as their technical director later this year. “Nick has made a huge contribution to Manchester United over the past nine years,\" United's director of football Jason Wilcox said. \"I was already well aware of his qualities before I arrived at the club and have really enjoyed working together.",
      "“Identifying and developing the best youth talent remains one of this club’s top priorities, and we are grateful for the work Nick has done to provide such a strong foundation for us to continue to build on.\"",
      "2019, the year that Henderson became a Premier League player with Sheffield United, coincided with Cox's appointment as head of the United academy. Nicky Butt assumed the role of head of first team development and both made invaluable contributions to reviving one of the most important sectors at United.",
      "In the years after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, the academy was neglected. Following Brian McClair's departure in 2015, there was no full-time academy head for a year. Instead, it was jointly run by the club secretary John Alexander and John Murtough, long before he assumed the prominent post of football director in 2021.",
      "United were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea, in the midst of monopolising the FA Youth Cup, in January 2016. Louis van Gaal watched Marcus Rashford from the stands at Altrincham a month before Rashford's stratospheric start to his professional career.",
      "That under 18 side also endured a 12-match losing run. Later that year, United's under 14s were annihilated 9-0 by Manchester City. There was uproar in Northern Ireland when United did not participate in the Milk Cup in 2015.",
      "The academy's reputation was buttressed at senior level by the breakthroughs of Rashford and Jesse Lingard, the 2016 FA Cup final matchwinner. Van Gaal handed debuts to 12 academy players, the majority of them undeserved or utterly unforeseen. Paddy McNair and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson had brief purple patches that gave the illusion the academy was in ship-shape.",
      "It wasn't until Butt returned to United to head the academy in February 2016. He oversaw an aggressive recruitment drive in the close season with Tahith Chong, Lee O'Connor, Nishan Burkart, Joshua Bohui and Millen Baars. None became United mainstays but a marker was laid down.",
      "After his promotion to the first team coaching staff by Jose Mourinho in 2018, some players found McKenna to be akin to a school teacher. His success at Ipswich Town is evidence that McKenna had the mettle to manage adults but his avuncular streak was apparent when he supported a nervous Gomes, aged 16, during a live televised interview with MUTV at the player of the year awards.",
      "Mourinho despaired at some of the players in the relegated under 21 side in 2018. \"Roshaun Williams, f*****g hell,\" he scoffed to a confidant. For Mourinho's final pre-season tour, Greenwood, Garner and Gomes were all included in the squad to usher in the more promising contingent.",
      "Cox ramped up United's overseas recruitment. Hannibal Mejbri cost £9m from Monaco in 2019, a year before United raided Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid for Marc Jurado, Alvaro Fernandez and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The European intake was never driven by Brexit, according to Cox. Jurado, Fernandez and Garnacho filled gaps at academy level to support the first team and all just happened to all be based in Spain, was his version of events.",
      "Fernandez is another United academy success story but one that got away from the first team. Garnacho's United career seems certain to end prematurely after five years yet he will be fondly remembered for his FA Youth Cup and FA Cup final winning goals.",
      "Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalled his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside over their X Box.",
      "Mark Dempsey, the academy coach brought back to United by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018, likened Garnacho to Peter Barnes, an old teammate during his fleeting playing career at United. Garnacho ended up ousting Rashford and has been bracketed with more celebrated United wingers.",
      "\"Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it,\" Cox once said. It could be 144 and out from Garnacho.",
      "Domestically, United bought Joe Hugill amid competition from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in 2020. Charlie McNeill also made headlines as he defected from City for £750,000.",
      "United's academy fell behind City's for several years, which made the McNeill deal such a coup. McNeill started out at the United academy before he was lured to City in 2014. City offered to put McNeill's siblings in St Bede's College.",
      "More significantly in 2014, City opened the City Football Academy. United sources accept their own training complex at Carrington is no longer fit for purpose, though their new first team building is due to be finished later this summer.",
      "Darren Fletcher's sons, Jack and Tyler, spent nine years in the City academy before their homecoming at United in 2014. Both are youth internationals, one for England and one for Scotland. United considered City's simultaneous approach for Harrison Parker to be a \"revenge move\" after the deal for the Fletchers.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, born in a City stronghold in Stockport, is another graduate who United figures feel highlights the academy's revival. Those who know Mainoo believe he would have gone to City at youth level had United's academy not been overhauled by Butt and Cox.",
      "United's domestic recruitment has had to become more intense since Brexit regulations prevented English clubs from signing under- 8s from overseas. The Fletcher twins, Harry Amass and Chido Obi have all been involved with the first team. Toby Collyer and Ethan Ennis joined from Brighton and Liverpool in 2022. United include Ayden Heaven, a £1.5million signing from Arsenal's academy, among them.",
      "Cox was saddened by Brexit blocking United from assembling more multicultural squads. He felt United's ethos always had a blend of local lads and overseas recruits. The Youth Cup winners in 2022 had a Czech, a Norwegian and two Spaniards in the starting XI.",
      "Maxi Oyedele, born in Salford and now at Legia Warsaw, has already played for the Poland national side and is generating notable interest. Zach Baumann, from Bolton, has played for the Ukraine youth team.",
      "With a predominantly British squad, United secured a triple-crown success in 2023-24. The only blemish was on the night they froze in a surprising Youth Cup loss at Swindon Town.",
      "In February 2020, United reached the Youth Cup semi-finals for the first time in eight years. It was not a vintage squad and Mejbri, with 13 appearances, had the most first-team exposure. It nevertheless represented another progressive stride.",
      "A potent youth team underachieved in the competition the next year, losing 1-0 to Liverpool at Leigh Sports Village, before the glory in 2022. The final, staged at Old Trafford, set a new record for a Youth Cup attendance as 67,492 clicked through the turnstiles.",
      "Cox was never going to allow that triumph to define the academy. His role was so broad he restructured the coaching staff, rebuilt the sports science team, considered psychological support, redeveloped the performance analysis team and built a life skills programme.",
      "His responsibilities evolved significantly, segueing from effectively a dual-role with Butt. Cox also sensibly downplayed the presence of youngsters training with the first team, attempting to counter the hype and provide context for their temporary promotions.",
      "No, it did not mean they were primed to be the next superstar. It is often owed to first team injuries, recovery days or international commitments. It was different when Garnacho missed the Youth Cup final media day at the academy building as Ralf Rangnick deemed him worthy of senior squad status.",
      "Tyrell Warren was one of the first academy players to be namechecked by Mourinho after he took over at United. A former academy teammate of Rashford's, he is now at Grimsby Town in League Two yet the Mancunian remains a shining example of the United academy.",
      "Cox attended United's EFL Trophy match with Barrow in 2022, flanked by Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell and Eamon Mulvey, stalwarts of the United youth set-up. Darren Fletcher was also present at Holker Street.",
      "Before kick-off, Warren and Adam Temple, a former United academy coach, entered the boardroom for a catch-up. \"That's a classy Manchester United thing to do,\" Cox enthused. \"Because they've been brought up that way. In that they come to welcome us to talk about how their season's going. And you sit there and you go, 'that is youth development in a nutshell'.",
      "\"A young lad that's been through your programme that is absolutely maxing out, he has reached his full potential. He's earning a living in the game.\"",
      "Warren has since moved to Grimsby Town, seven places better off than Barrow last season. He had not hit a wall."

      "Carrick emerged as an integral figure a third of the way through Mourinho's first campaign at Old Trafford. After the Europa League group stage defeat to Fenerbahce at the start of November, United lost one of their next 28 matches - a League Cup semi-final second leg reverse at Hull City in which they still progressed to the final.",
      "Mourinho recalled Carrick for United's next game after Fenerbahce, a 3-1 victory away to Swansea City. In December and January, United embarked on a nine-game winning run and Carrick started in six as he was rested for the other three.",
      "Carrick was added to Mourinho's coaching staff after he retired from playing in May 2018 and he spent six months in the dugout before the Portuguese was sacked in December 2018.",
      "United beat Tottenham three times and Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City twice under Mourinho. They were unbeaten in four games against Liverpool until a 3-1 defeat in Mourinho's final match in charge at Anfield while there was a memorable 2-1 victory at Juventus in the Champions League a month earlier.",
      "“He was hungry to win,\" Carrick said of Mourinho, \"which is a pretty obvious thing to say. He was his own man and he knew how to win big games. That was his biggest asset.\"",
      "Carrick took over as United caretaker manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. Carrick was in charge for three games in 11 days, overseeing wins against Villarreal and Arsenal and a draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Minutes after the 3-2 win against Arsenal at Old Trafford, United confirmed Carrick would leave the club after 15-and-a-half years as a player, coach and manager.",
      "Incoming interim manager Ralf Rangnick was in the directors' box for the Arsenal match and intended on retaining Carrick as part of his backroom staff. Carrick was named the Middlesbrough manager in October 2022 but was sacked earlier this month after they failed to make the Championship Play-offs.",
      "“It was a big responsibility,\" Carrick added of his managerial stint at United, \"but it didn't really feel like such a big step or a big difference. I was used to being at the club for so long, and you get used to it once you're there and once you've seen it.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes you to get there to understand what it feels like. I thought I’d do the job there for a few games, which was difficult when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer left. However, being so close to Ole, it felt natural.",
      "\"It wasn't anything too much and it felt quite comfortable doing the job.\""

      "Following their worst season in 51 years, Manchester United had to act quickly in the transfer market.",
      "Such an abysmal campaign simply could not be followed by weeks of inactivity, and the club wasted no time in announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha. Interest in Bryan Mbeumo soon surfaced, with United hopeful of wrapping up a deal for last season's fourth-top scorer in the Premier League.",
      "A solid start to the window, but the centre forward problem remains.",
      "After Liam Delap opted for a move to Chelsea, updates on United's pursuit of a striker have been few and far between. And that is to be expected, with June 30 representing the final day of the financial year in the Premier League. Plenty of clubs will be waiting for that date to pass before looking to make further signings.",
      "Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres are the two names being heavily linked with United, and it's easy to see why links with players currently plying their trade in the Premier League have been so rare.",
      "Osimhen and Gyokeres will both command hefty fees, but the reported price tag being bandied about for someone like Alexander Isak tells you just how expensive strikers who have proven themselves in the Premier League can be.",
      "There's been an obvious shift in United's business this summer, with the club looking to sign players who have shown themselves to be able to cut it in the English top flight. Cunha and Mbeumo scored a combined total of 35 Premier League goals last season, just nine short of United's tally of 44.",
      "No signing comes without its risks, but this approach does at least eliminate the risk of a player not taking to the demands of Premier League football. Whether they can cope with the demands of being a Premier League footballer for Manchester United is another matter entirely.",
      "It remains to be seen who United will target to lead the line next season. If it's Osimhen or Gyokeres then United will definitely end up paying a sizeable fee. But it's bound to be less than they'd have to pay for a proven Premier League goalscorer.",
      "A tweak in United's summer transfer window approach is needed."

      "Manchester United could finally be about to move ahead with their attempt to bolster Ruben Amorim's centre-forward options this summer.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, United have been working to sign another attacker with Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo close to becoming signing number two. There are also plans to add another option in the final third after United recorded their worst goalscoring season in 51 years.",
      "United finished the Premier League season with -10 goal difference with Bruno Fernandes topping their scoring charts with 19. Centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund (10) and Joshua Zirkzee (7) failed to hit the heights needed and expected of strikers to grace Old Trafford.",
      "Centre-forwards cost a premium but United are anticipated to hand Amorim a talismanic number nine to lead the line next season. In an ideal world, one of Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen would have been through the door by now, or at the very least close to joining.",
      "That hasn't been the case and after United were rejected by Liam Delap, the hunt for the right candidate goes on. Moves for Gyokeres or Osimhen could still play out but alternatives continue to be suggested, some with Premier League experience and others with an impressive goalscoring record.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic is the new name on their radar and with the Juventus star entering the final year of his contract this summer, the opportunity to sign him has never been greater. The Serbian has scored 56 goals for the Old Lady yet Randal Kolo Muani's permanent move to Turn has added another nail into his coffin.",
      "With talks over a new contract stalling due to Vlahovic's decision not to take a pay cut to stay, United could swoop in. Now, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, Juve are plotting a move to replace the 25-year-old and progress in a deal could be the green light that Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have been waiting for.",
      "Di Marzio has claimed that 'explorative talks' have been held with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson and his camp over a possible move. Delap's move to Stamford Bridge and the Blues' continued links to Hugo Ekitike and Osimhen means the Senegal international is no longer unsellable.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are also considering a move for Jackson but they are understood to be prioritising Lorenzo Lucca and Darwin Nunez. Yet should Nunez leave Liverpool for Juventus or Jackson moves to Italy, Vlahovic will be guaranteed to move away from the Allianz Arena and United will finally be able to get their hands on a new striker."

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…\n20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) Gabriel Martinelli – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nBayern are said to be eyeing Martinelli after missing out on Florian Wirtz and the winger will certainly see his game time at Arsenal limited if Mikel Arteta lands a new winger, as is his intention. Reports suggest Arsenal want £50million for Martinelli, which Bayern could afford, but this doesn’t seem to have moved beyond the exploratory stage.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "15) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",

      "14) 🆕 Rodrigo Muniz – Fulham to Leeds\nLeeds have gone hard for Muniz – but not hard enough. Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "13) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "11) Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "10) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million."

      "Liverpool already have an active buy-back option on one academy graduate before Jarell Quansah, while Manchester United have thrown them around recently.",
      "Liverpool have cursed the career of Quansah by sticking a buy-back clause into his Bayer Leverkusen deal, but who else could they and other Premier League clubs bring back soon?",
      "These are the known active buy-back options Premier League clubs hold over sold players.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsey\nA significant knee injury has limited Ramsey to 18 appearances for Burnley since he made his £14m move in August 2023.",
      "“It feels so amazing to be back on the pitch, it feels like a dream,” he said after making a six-minute cameo in the club’s penultimate game of their promotion season.",
      "Unai Emery’s presence has likely contributed to Aston Villa adopting the more European approach of baking buy-back clauses into many a sale, especially those of young, homegrown players whose development could be accelerated by regular minutes elsewhere.",
      "But they will not be cashing in their Ramsey receipt any time soon, although his long-awaited return might prompt them to keep tabs again.",
      "",
      "Tammy Abraham\nThere are a variety of reasons Chelsea will be ignoring correspondence from Roma asking whether they want to trigger their buy-back option on Abraham.",
      "A £68m fee seems particularly prohibitive, especially in conjunction with a record of 20 goals in his last 110 games for both the Giallorossi and on loan at Milan.",
      "But perhaps the toughest barrier for Abraham to overcome will be that he is a 27-year-old England international centre-forward rather than a South American teenager yet to make his professional debut. There will be no seven-year contract.",
      "",
      "Bobby Clark\nOne of Jurgen Klopp’s 42 children at Liverpool, the son of Lee made waves at Anfield including playing 48 minutes as a substitute in the 2024 League Cup final, before unseating Trent Alexander-Arnold as the club’s youngest European goalscorer and guaranteeing himself a future mural in the process.",
      "Liverpool were loathe to lose Clark but, as ever with transfer negotiations, ensured the situation was weighted ludicrously in their favour when the inevitable happened.",
      "As well as a £10m fee which constituted one of the highest ever paid in Austrian league history, Liverpool got Salzburg to agree to a 17.5% sell-on clause and buy-back option.",
      "It has remained untouched through a season which featured one goal, two assists and a Pep Lijnders sacking in 25 appearances.",
      "",
      "Gavin Bazunu\n“All of them are fantastic players. Southampton bought really good players,” said Pep Guardiola.",
      "“They could stay one to two years. They want Premier League, so after agreement with the clubs we have a buyback on all of them so just in case they explode we have a chance to get them back.”",
      "Chelsea soon eliminated any temptation Manchester City might have had to take Romeo Lavia straight back but three Etihad academy graduates remained at Southampton after joining in summer 2022.",
      "Bazunu has kept 16 clean sheets and conceded 115 goals in 78 games for Saints, spending some of this past season on loan to Standard Liege. It does not scream Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Juan Larios\nNor does 153 minutes in three seasons on the south coast.",
      "",
      "Sam Edozie\nOr a loan at Anderlecht last season.",
      "",
      "James Trafford\nFar more likely is that Manchester City chuck £42m at Burnley and watch their 20% sell-on do the rest of the work while welcoming Trafford back into the fold and almost certainly selling him again immediately.",
      "Ederson will need replacing eventually but there are doubts over whether Trafford can properly replicate his Championship and England age group brilliance to a Premier League stage.",
      "And with Newcastle and Chelsea threatening to hijack each other’s moves for the 22-year-old, Manchester City could capitalise in the ultimate PSR-take.",
      "",
      "Jacob Wright\nFour substitute appearances amounting to 61 appearances across the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup prevented Wright from joining the Manchester City transfer cheat code list but it was still a feat to extract £2.3m from Championship side Norwich for the inexperienced midfielder.",
      "Wright impressed enough on loan at Carrow Road to earn a permanent move which the Canaries might end up paying more for in add-ons.",
      "Manchester City will be keeping tabs in case the 19-year-old shines and their buy-back or sell-on clauses come into action.",
      "",
      "Willy Kambwala\nThere are few areas in which Manchester United have definitely improved their operations over the last few years, but they are absolutely better at engineering more advantageous sales.",
      "Kambwala played ten games for Erik ten Hag through an injury crisis in 2023/24 but remained low down the centre-half pecking order and had rejected a new contract offer so the teenager was sold to Villarreal for a deal worth £9.6m, with a healthy sell-on clause and three-year buy-back option.",
      "After playing a decent number of games to help Villarreal finish fifth and secure Champions League qualification, Kambwala might end up receiving a couple of calls from some familiar Manchester-based numbers soon.",
      "",
      "Facundo Pellistri\nIt was a similar story with Pellistri, for whom Panathinaikos could end up paying £6.8m to essentially borrow if he comes good in Greece.",
      "Manchester United hold a mammoth 45% sell-on clause but also another buy-back option which lasts for three years. The forward scoring four goals in 36 appearances in his debut campaign for the Super League runners-up is unlikely to see it activated.",
      "",
      "Hannibal Mejbri\nGary Neville would absolutely like to see Hannibal lecture the Manchester United squad on the importance of kicking Liverpool players but that violent cameo ended up being the highlight of the midfielder’s 13-game Old Trafford career.",
      "It could be revisited down the line as the Red Devils this time negotiated a £9.4m fee and 50% sell-on clause to go with their now standard buy-back option. Manchester United could have a hell of a team one day if all these offloaded talents realise their potential simultaneously.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood\nAs the Daily Telegraph reported in July 2024:",
      "‘There is also a buy-back option in the agreement with Marseille. These are fairly routine nowadays where the sale of academy graduates or young talents are concerned but, given Greenwood’s history, the decision to include a buy-back clause could be perceived as somewhat contentious.",
      "‘Nonetheless, Telegraph Sport understands there is no expectation or intention of Greenwood coming back in the future and that, if the clause does signify the door remains ajar for the player down the line, it is very much the slimmest of cracks. The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘in talks’ over signing Burnley star James Trafford but they face competition from rivals Chelsea.",
      "Manchester City are reportedly interested in signing the best goalkeeper in the Championship, in a potential battle with fellow Champions League side Newcastle.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked a “world-class” goalkeeper they ‘want’ to replace £47m flop Andre Onana.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona ‘want to sign’ Mason Greenwood and one of his former Manchester United teammates this summer.",
      "Mason Greenwood is ‘pining for a return’ to the Premier League as at least two sides ‘weigh up’ a summer move for the former Man Utd star.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly been dealt a ‘blow’ as their hopes of earning a ‘windfall’ via a summer transfer involving Mason Greenwood are fading."

      "It’s fair to say that Liverpool fans are giddy about Florian Wirtz and their summer transfers, even if rival fans want to remind them of Chelsea.",
      "Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Apologies Richard Hughes\nI’m not sure how many contributors write in to offer an apology, but after a scorching (and hungover) Sunday morning run while catching up on podcasts, I feel I owe Liverpool’s Director of Football, Richard Hughes, a sincere one. So Richard, I apologise for doubting you. Not that you’d care one jot.",
      "It’s now clear that far from being paralysed with fear à la Roy Hodgson, that you, along with Michael Edwards and the data team have been meticulously laying the groundwork for what might turn out to be our most significant transfer window in six years, if not ever.",
      "I’m absolutely astonished we’ve landed Wirtz, the best player on the market this year. Like many fans, I’m dying to know what Arne Slot said to convince him to choose Anfield. Over pints at the pub this weekend, a few mates and I concluded it might’ve just been three simple words: “My Bobby Firmino.”",
      "On top of that, the potential replacements of Trent, Robbo, Diaz, and Alisson with Wirtz, Frimpong, Kerkez, and Mamardashvili drop the average age of our starting XI from 26.7 to 24.3. That’s no small feat, and it’s been done quickly and quietly.",
      "Now, I can’t wrap this up without a gentle jab at our rivals.",
      "I love how certain respected journalists continue to cozy up to Sir Alex Ferguson by framing the signings of Cunha and possibly Mbeumo as proof Man United still have pulling power. Hmm. Back in SAF’s day, they’d have been in for Wirtz and prising Nico Williams out of Spain. Now, they’re celebrating buying the best player from a side that finished below them, who spent 77.6% of the season walking (for comparison, VVD was 76%). Oh, and he gets a 67% pay rise for the privilege. It’s not quite taking Margot Robbie home!!",
      "As for Arsenal, their current blend of self-righteousness and transfer window anxiety is best summed up not by me, but by Paddy Power’s Instagram feed. Nothing I write here could possibly top that.",
      "And to Manchester (115) City and Chelsea, enjoy being pawns in Infantino’s U.S. experiment while Salah, Mac Allister, and Gravenberch are recovering on a beach somewhere. I’m sure playing in 35°C heat all July will have zero effect on your squad fitness come spring.",

      "MAILBOX: Liverpool not firm PL title favourites due to four concerns as ‘new Havertz’ Wirtz faces Sancho repeat",
      "",
      "Nobody wins the transfer window\nA few days ago, another reader wrote in claiming the Club World Cup was going to be the second-best club tournament in the world – after berating English fans as being biased against the tournament and lauding the teams (South American) who were taking it seriously. Ironic that he didn’t consider that those same teams might consider their equivalent of the Champions League – the Copa Libertadores – as either the best or, at worst, second-best club competition. No?",
      "Of course, being mid-season probably helps those clubs – still early enough in their season, they are fresh, while having a chance to gel as a team. Compared to those from Europe who have played non-stop for almost 11 months, and with the international break and bedding in new players, it will take a game or two to get back up to speed. Notwithstanding the heat they are dealing with.",
      "On that topic. I am reading about how baseball players are throwing up, needing to be withdrawn, and requiring misting and hydration stations to survive games. And this is in a sport that doesn’t require the same level of endurance, stamina, and cardiovascular exertion. Of course, this was all predictable. Not a great portent for next year’s World Cup. Not sure what’s worse though, all the fawning over the competition by pundits, totally ignoring all the issues or the competition itself.",
      "Lastly, no one wins a transfer window. It’s exciting when new players are brought in. I get it. But if past transfer windows are any gauge…just recently, Chelsea acquired 12 players in 2023, including Jackson, Palmer, Caicado and Lavia, with many Chelsea fans lauding ‘winning’ Caicedo and Lavia over Liverpool. But Liverpool did better during that season and the following year won the league with just one signing to Chelsea’s 10 signings.",
      "Some assumptions around Liverpool doing well are for signings that haven’t yet happened but might happen. And what if any of those new guys, particularly Wirtz gets injured? Frimpong is not a like-for-like exchange for TAA, and his defending stats are actually worse. Kerkez isn’t a Liverpool player yet, and Wirtz still has to be slotted (pun intended) into the current team without disrupting what worked well last season.",
      "The point is, there is a long way to go. City and Chelsea have a chance to get some early pre-season in for new players, as they are going to have a shorter traditional pre-season.",
      "For United fans bemoaning little transfer action so far, it isn’t just related to the quality of the management team in place (which is poor to be fair) but the fact that once you drop down a level, have no Champions League draw card and have to reduce the wage budget – as the past overpaying for mediocre players takes its toll – means waiting until the ‘big boys’ have had their pick of the crop.",
      "While things could be turned around – as other teams have shown – picking an only-one-way-to-play manager, playing a style that doesn’t suit most of the current squad and hasn’t shown itself to be that effective, was probably the worst decision the club could have made at this point. He’s not a draw card either. So while I said there’s no winning a transfer season, Utd are going to show the downside of being the ‘second best’ in this case.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "Buy-back craic\nInteresting article on Liverpool buy back clauses.",
      "Maybe clubs sometimes use them to make the player more desirable knowing they’re never coming back?\nAidan, Lfc (either a really stupid or obvious point – I’m prone to both)",
      "",
      "Big up yourselves and leave Liverpool flop talk\nWhilst there’s not much football to watch. although the U21’s game was a good watch (why do they keep losing the ball 30/40 yards from goal!} and the CWC is a grossly inflated pre-season friendly tournament, the mailbox and comments section are dominated by talk of transfers and next season.",
      "There are always people who treat all supporters of other teams with petty prejudices and outlandish generalisations, there also exists a large group of people who I would say is far more common and exemplifies an awful lot of fans, it’s the “it’s more important you fail, than we succeed” band.",
      "All teams will spend or have spent money in the belief that there squad will be improved, some clubs will sell their prized assets but will aim to re-invest this in other hidden gems. And yet, rather than talk up their team’s chances of a better season than last, a large number of people are fixated on the potential “flops” of their rivals.",
      "Man City have spent in excess of £400mil since the turn of the year and have signed a fabulous forward from the Bundesliga, the “midfielder of the season” from Serie A, a French “wonderkid” and some others at around the £40mil mark. Chelsea have bought a centre forward who may able to stay on the pitch for more than four minutes. Arsenal are seeking the mythical “centre forward” that has cost them the last three titles and a world class DM to allow Declan Rice to flourish. Even ManU look to have upgraded on their mis-firing forward line and are not finished yet.",
      "Despite this, quite a number seem pre-occupied with talking about how much Liverpool’s signings may “flop”. The fact that last season’s champions have (to use comments from last season) replaced a right back who can’t defend, an over the hill left back, signed a creative ball playing midfielder/forward to replace their non creative, non goalscoring, stagnant midfield and appear to be keen to add a centre forward to replace their megaflop and possibly strengthen their centre back options, would worry me immensely if I supported any other team.",
      "I know people will/can be ridiculed if they make big statements (e.g. the title is won already) but surely any “normal” supporter should be saying, “our signings have made us better, our signings will mean we will do better than last season”, otherwise, what’s the point, talk about your team, your hopes and dreams, don’t tie yourself up in knots wishing others to fail, embrace your own possibilities!",
      "Unfortunately this is not new, many (many) years ago, I asked a friend who supported a team in blue what his hopes were for the coming season, his initial response was, “I hope you don’t win anything”!\nHoward (is the quad on?) Jones",

      "England have missed an Under-21 trick\nPresumably every team in the U21 tournament has players in the FIFA Club Cup or in their own senior teams. The teams are all under strengthen in comparison to the actual eligible players.  Spain are not fielding Yamal for example. So the results of the tournament are not exactly one-to-one match ups with World Cup or Euro results.",
      "But there’s obviously something qualitative that happens to dip between the U21 and senior England teams. Not just the inevitable drop off subtracting merely talented footballers with the absolute top of approximately 24 players remaining. Have the U21 players simply got things to prove still and peak as teens? While the senior players are just maintaining earned privileged status and a lavish mortgage?",
      "The game is also trending young btw. Especially with the Mbappe example of 2018 World Cup which he’s not repeated once he got the fame and big salary. Yamal wins the Euros at 16-17 and may be on the same trajectory as Mbappe, not likely to repeat the international feats of his teen years in his 20s.",
      "Historically European players are said to peak around 26-27 blending their gifts with hard won experience. Recent international football results have been produced by fast fast running teenagers who cheekily trounce slightly older men.",

      "Manchester United aim to ‘seduce’ Lucien Agoume into snubbing Arsenal in favour of a move to Old Trafford with two promises to the Sevilla star.",
      "Agoume has emerged as a target for Arsenal this week as the Gunners look for a replacement for Thomas Partey.",
      "Contract talks with the Ghanaian have ‘collapsed’ after he asked for an increase in his £200,000 per week salary to extend his deal at the Emirates.",
      "PSG’s Warren Zaire-Emery, Barcelona’s Marc Casado and Real Madrid’s Eduardo Camavinga represent unlikely options thought to be of interest to Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, with Agoume a more realistic option along with Lille’s teen sensation Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes has confirmed that Arsenal see Agoume – whose game has been compared to N’Golo Kante – ‘as an interesting option for its balance between physical, tactical criteria and projection’.",
      "The report claims ‘Arsenal seems to be the closest destination’ but with ‘nothing closed yet’, both Tottenham and Manchester United have entered the race.",
      "‘Tottenham see in Agoume an opportunity to add a young and versatile profile in the centre of the field’, while United ‘consider the Frenchman an alternative to rebuild an area of the team that showed many shortcomings last season’ after a less than impressive first campaign for £42m Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It’s claimed that without European football the Red Devils will ‘seduce the player with minutes and a solid project’…",
      "United are also desperate to land a new striker after a poor season for Rasmus Hojlund, who’s been heavily linked with a move to Serie A, and after top target Viktor Gyokeres confirmed he has no interest in a move to Old Trafford, a very surprising move for Everton’s Beto – who moved to Goodison Park for £21m from Udinese in 2023 – has been mooted by the president of Uniao Tires, the striker’s first club.",
      "“Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal,” Lopes told The Sun.",
      "“Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it is quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as a lone No 9 waiting for service.",
      "“Beto’s a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn’t lose duels. He is a real headache for opponents — if he gets the service. In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "“Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate — plus he is very fast. When Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.”"

Meanwhile, in the locker room there is division of opinions, and some players hope that the final decision will not alter the internal harmony or the positive dynamics that are sought to be built under the new technical direction.’",

      "Eager to add ‘captains and leaders’, Amorim is described as a ‘long-term admirer’ of the Villa shot-stopper, which may urge him to change his stance on retaining Onana as his first choice.",
      "But Villa’s £40m asking price may well prove to be a barrier for United, with the club in the market for new players in multiple positions after their worst season in living memory and with not a great deal of spare cash to spend given their failure to qualify for Europe as a result of that dreadful campaign.",
      "With that in mind, they’ve reportedly made an opening bid of €15m [£12.8m] for Lunin, who impressed for Los Blancos last season as he covered for the injured Thibaut Courtois, but has found himself back on the sidelines this term following the Belgium international’s return to full fitness.",
      "Lunin recently extended his Madrid contract to 2030 but did so ‘on the condition of reviewing his situation at the end of the season’, which prompted United to hold ‘conversations’ with Lunin’s agent, Jorge Mendes, and make the bid, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "That opening offer has been ‘rejected’ by the La Liga giants, who reportedly value the 26-year-old at €20m [£17m].",
      "There’s also said to be interest from AC Milan in Lunin as ‘a new round of talks is expected’ between Chelsea and the Serie A side over a deal for Mike Maignan after the Blues made a £12.8m bid for the France international which fell short of Milan’s £20m valuation.",

      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "But Leeds, West Ham and a handful of others are yet to act on their interest, perhaps because of his wage demands and obvious curse.",

      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is practically certain that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain.",
      "The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests, but more pertinently to convince the club’s hierarchy that the finances involved are worth it.",
      "By all accounts it is a battle he has conceded, leaving Barcelona to agree personal terms before overcoming the obstacle of working out how they are actually going to pay for him.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham for £9m and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",

      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",

      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",

      "Andoni Iraola\nBournemouth quietly fell off towards the end of the season to bring their dream of European qualification combined with FA Cup glory crashing back down to reality. But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause. Spurs have at least removed themselves from the equation.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",
      "Of course there is a seven-year contract, add-ons and a sell-on clause.",
      "",
      "Dastan Satpaev (Kairat Almaty to Chelsea, £3.3m, August 2026)\nIt is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",

      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, £100m)\nIt’s done. Liverpool have smashed their transfer record, which could rise by another £16m. It’s the biggest transfer of the 2025 summer window and surely won’t be usurped.",
      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Liverpool (x2), Manchester United (x2), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1)",
      "Total cost: £989.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

      "",
      "28) Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)\nSigned from Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen for a cool £25m in 2021, Bailey failed to hit the heights expected of him in his first year for Villa. We said ‘2023/24 is his last chance to prove himself at Villa Park’ and he did just that. Bailey was fantastic. But he’s now reportedly surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "27) Matthijs de Ligt (Manchester United)\nWe don’t think De Ligt was that bad for Man United last season. He did have a mad few minutes at Anfield, mind.",
      "",
      "26) Robin Koch (Leeds)\nKoch is decent in the air, comfortable on the ball, versatile, rarely injured, but not the most convincing defender in the world.",
      "",
      "25) Mathys Tel (Tottenham)\nHis six months on loan at Spurs was pretty disappointing, but then Spurs were historically s**t. They recently signed him permanently from Bayern.",
      "",
      "24) Mark Flekken (Brentford)\nFlekken was fine for Brentford. Not outstanding but not bad by any stretch. He made the most saves across Europe’s top five leagues last season.",
      "",
      "23) Brajan Gruda (Brighton)\nBrighton paid £25m for the young German, who is beginning to show why on a more frequent basis.",
      "",
      "22) Marcel Sabitzer (Manchester United)\nSigned on loan for the second half of 22/23, Sabitzer filled a gap for Erik ten Hag and barely put a foot wrong. His form at Borussia Dortmund and for Austria at Euro 2024 will have been hard for Man Utd to stomach. They could have had him for £15m!",
      "",
      "21) Tyler Adams (Leeds)\nLeeds made some questionable signings before their relegation season, but Tyler Adams was a brilliant one. For every Brenden Aaronson, there is an Adams and Willy Gnonto, as the famous saying goes.",
      "The American international left for Bournemouth after his single year at Leeds made it clear that he is far too good for the Championship.",
      "",
      "20) Moussa Niakhate (Nottingham Forest)\nOne of 400 signings made by Nottingham Forest before 2022/23, Niakhate left Mainz – where he was captain – to take on his first challenge in England.",
      "Niakhate was pretty solid for Forest but not a £27m player, we don’t think. That is what they got for him from Lyon, making it £47m in total for him and Mangala. Good going, that. Especially when you consider Niakhate only cost Forest around £8m.",
      "",
      "19) Chris Richards (Crystal Palace)\nRichards joined Palace for around £10m in July 2022 and has been pretty solid whenever called upon.",

      "",
      "17) Kevin Schade (Brentford)\nBrentford paid around £20m to sign the 23-year-old from Freiburg and after a difficult spell with injuries, Schade has kicked on. He recorded 11 goals and two assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "",
      "16) Demarai Gray (Everton)\nEverton got Gray for a measly £1.5m and he did not live up to that price tag. In a good way, this time.",
      "",
      "15) Kai Havertz (Chelsea)\nStruggled when he joined, then scored the winning goal in a Champions League final, became even worse, but left for £65m. That goal and the fact Chelsea recouped the vast majority of the £72m for Havertz sees him as high as 15th.",
      "",
      "14) Hee-chan Hwang (Wolves)\nYou know what you will get from Hwang, but he has been poor for too long now and drops down here.",
      "",
      "13) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City)\nCity landed Ortega on a free transfer in the summer of 2022. As far as back-up goalkeepers go, the German is one of the best in the world.",
      "",
      "12) Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool)\nSzoboszlai was really disappointing before Arne Slot came along. He was crucial in Liverpool’s Premier League title win. But he now has the most expensive attacking midfielder of all time to compete for a starting spot with.",
      "",
      "11) Taiwo Awoniyi (Nottingham Forest)\n“Taiwo Awoniyi will score two league goals all season”. That is what this idiot said in our 2022/23 pre-season predictions.",
      "Awoniyi proved me wrong, scoring a very respectable 10 in 27. Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",
      "Those goals are the reason why Forest will play in Europe next season and not the Championship.",
      "",
      "10) Maxence Lacroix (Crystal Palace)\nReplacing Joachim Andersen was always going to be difficult but Palace have done exceptionally well with Lacroix. He makes losing Marc Guehi a little less scary.",
      "",
      "9) Thiago (Liverpool)\nThiago was an outstanding technician and has decided to call it a day on his playing career last summer after another year riddled with injuries.",
      "Despite his fitness issues, Thiago was still a good signing; especially considering the Reds only paid £20m to sign him from Bayern Munich.",

      "8) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nNobody really expected much from Akanji when he joined from Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund but he quickly proved he is a top player.",
      "The Swiss international has played superbly as a central defender and even more impressively as a full-back.",
      "",
      "7) Micky van de Ven (Tottenham)\nVan de Ven’s pace is frightening. He can defend as well, which helps. Those hamstrings though…",
      "",

      "",
      "5) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta cost close to £10m in January 2022 and took a while to get going, but when he did, bloody hell, he has been difficult to stop.",
      "He is loving life under Oliver Glasner, finishing the 23/24 season with 16 league goals after scoring two in his first 19 appearances in 22/23 and eight in 77 in total. He then bagged 14 in 24/25 and helped Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "4) Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool)\nLike Thiago, Konate does have his injury troubles. Nevertheless, when he is fit Konate forms a terrific partnership with Virgil van Dijk. £36m = bargain.",
      "",
      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",

      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",
      "He now has one of the biggest contracts in world football after City tied him down for 115 months. Cheeky.",

      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",

      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
