      "Manchester United are set for a busy summer as they look to revamp their squad after enduring their worst ever Premier League campaign. United finished 15th in the league and also missed out on Champions League qualification after losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "The Red Devils have already finalised a £62.5million deal for Matheus Cunha and plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected. The likes of Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are set to complete permanent exits, while captain Bruno Fernandes could also leave.",
      "Reports have claimed that Andre Onana is a target for newly-promoted Saudi Pro League side Neom SC.",
      "It is claimed that United would be opene to selling the goalkeeper, who made several high-profile errors this season. However, it has previously been reported that Onana wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Andre's plan is to stay in Manchester and he wants to knuckle down and get United back to where they should be,\" a source was quoted as saying last month. \"His sole focus is on United and nothing else. He's a confident person and wants to prove the doubters wrong. He knows he has made mistakes but he sees proving people wrong as a challenge.\"",
      "Barcelona have been linked with a move for Marcus Rashford and the club's sporting director, Deco, has delivered an update on their transfer plans.",
      "\"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come,\" Deco told BBC Sport. \"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.",
      "\"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "According to Italian outlet Messaggero Veneto, United are interested in Udinese defender Oumar Solet.",
      "Solet has impressed since joining Udinese from Salzburg in January and the likes of Napoli and Bournemouth have also been linked with the 25-year-old. The report states that Udinese are planning to cash in on Solet this summer, having set a price tag of around £30m.",

      "Hojlund's struggles have been well documented since he arrived at the beginning of last season. The summer signing needed until Boxing Day before he scored his first Premier League goal. This term his numbers have again dropped, scoring just 10 times - with only four coming in the league",
      "Concerns were raised over Hojlund's suitability to lead the line at such a tender age whilst he still had to prove himself. The player has confessed \"it would have been nice to have a bit of support.”",

      "Manchester United have moved on from Liam Delap and will now look to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo in a £50million deal this summer. The Red Devils are growing increasingly confident of being able to lure the forward to Old Trafford after the striker indicated he wanted to move to the club.",
      "United will be required to fight off interest from the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal to secure the Cameroon international. Ruben Amorim is said to be keen to make Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024/25, an integral member of his team.",
      "The Red Devils have returned their attention to Mbeumo after missing out to Chelsea for Ipswich Town Forward Delap. The 22-year-old former Man City youngster is primed to be announced as the Blues' newest signing after undergoing his medical, with Chelsea having agreed to pay his £30m release clause.",
      "United will hope to continue to strengthen Amorim's hand after announcing their first deal of the summer of the weekend. The 13-times Premier League champions confirmed a deal for Matheus Cunha after agreeing a £62.5million deal with Wolves.",
      "The Brazil forward was present in Manchester over the weekend before departing for international duty. The club want to replenish their front line after failing to see a member of their squad reach double figures in the Premier League's goalscoring charts.",
      "But United's attention turning to Mbeumo also appears to suggest an emphasis on targeting Premier League talent. That would appear to see the club taking a different approach to recent seasons.",
      "Last summer saw some heavy spending as the likes of Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee were brought in from abroad and the season before that saw only Mason Mount arrive from England's top-flight. And in 2022/23, the signings of Antony, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro stole the headlines, though United did take advantage of Christian Eriksen being available for free",
      "It perhaps comes as little surprise that the club would look from within the division after struggling to 15th in 2024/25. And United's issues were all the more evident domestically, as they earned their way to the final before coming unstuck against British opposition in Tottenham.",
      "United boss Amorim has previously highlighted why he believes issues have been found when playing more familiar opposition. \"When you play against any team in England, the physicality is there,\" he said.",
      "\"If you don’t have physicality, you will struggle a lot. Antony is so much better now in Spain. There are many factors, but I guarantee you it’s physicality.\"",
      "And bringing players in who already have Premier League experience, and have thrived in the environment, such as Cunha and Mbeumo, would not only improve the team but potentially require less time to adjust. After a dismal start for Amorim, he will hope such players at least offer part of the answer.",

The forward has just one year left on his contract in west London but Brentford hold an option to extend the deal by 12 months.",

The 24-year-old is among Europe's most attacking right-backs and bagged five goals and eight assists in 2024/25, having scored 10 goals and provided seven assists this season before.",

      "It's the £300million question - and only Bruno Fernandes has the answer. The Manchester United captain has been given the chance to leave the sinking ship at Old Trafford for steadier waters in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal, one of the big hitters in the Saudi Pro League, have offered Fernandes a mega £700,000 per week contract which the 30-year-old is understood to be seriously considering after his agent met Saudi chiefs in Riyadh last week. Three years in the Middle East would see him pocket a staggering £200m while Al-Hilal are also willing to pay United a £100m fee.",
      "That's enough to transform the Red Devils' summer transfer budget and give Ruben Amorim funds to further build the team in his own image. But at what cost?",
      "United's lowly 15th-placed finish was off the back of Fernandes' brilliant individual campaign, so would his departure deepen their ongoing crisis? Amorim, at least publicly, wants him to stay but the Portugal international hinted that he'd be open to leaving following last month's Europa League final defeat.",
      "Fernandes should be off from Manchester United like a shot. He owes United nothing, having carried them on his back for the last few seasons.",
      "And his reward for this is to be left stuck in a team without European football - and with a cat in hell's chance of winning the title next season. He will be 31 in September and is approaching the age when big names look to cash in one last time. And moves don't come more lucrative than ones to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He will know leaving Old Trafford would leave the team in an even deeper hole. But that's not his problem. And besides, club bosses have just made him go on a farcical post-season tour to Hong Kong and Malaysia, so he also knows where United's skewed priorities lie.",
      "From the player's point of view, this would seem like something of a no-brainer. Bruno Fernandes is the wrong side of 30, Manchester United are in a perilous state and there is no European football on the horizon.",
      "If Fernandes had a concrete offer from one of the continent's big-hitters, there would be a decision to make. But in lieu of that, could anyone really blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia rather than staying at Old Trafford?",
      "Yes, the standard of football is dramatically worse. But he will be a marquee figure and there is little evidence it will affect his international involvement given Cristiano Ronaldo's enduring Portugal career despite playing in the Middle East.",
      "I'm still not convinced Manchester United have quite bottomed out yet, and Fernandes should take the opportunity to make sure he's not around to see that happen. Not to mention the £100million parting gift to swell the club's coffers. It might even save a dinner lady her job.",
      "The focus shouldn't be on reasons for him leaving, they should be all about why he should stay. After all, Fernandes has essentially carried United on his back for five-and-a-half years, with only two domestic cups to show for it.",
      "In a hypothetical world, he could have moved to the other half of Manchester and already be in conversations for being the league's best player. United have done nothing to improve the squad around him since he arrived in 2020 - in fact it has got significantly worse.",
      "At 30, Fernandes could be excused for lacking the patience for what seems to be another massive rebuild at Old Trafford. I would like to see him stay in Europe, but who could blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia?",
      "United under Sir Jim Ratcliffe seem more bothered about their balance sheet than the team sheet. Fernandes would do well to cut ties.",
      "There's obviously the Club World Cup pressure as Al-Hilal press for a deal during this mini transfer window, but if any player deserves a summer off then it is Bruno Fernandes, so if he can find a way to sit tight then I'd do that right now.",
      "The Portuguese has just had arguably the best season of his career, despite everything crumbling around him at Manchester United. But if he is to leave - which he probably should do if he's interested in winning things - I'd like to see him at one of Europe's top sides before making the move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes previously had three seasons at Udinese and one at Sampdoria, is well respected at Italy's bigger clubs, and he'd certainly improve Inter Milan given their showing at the weekend. He'd make AC Milan, Napoli, Juventus and the rest better, too.",
      "Italy might not be an option for him just yet though, and it certainly won't be as lucrative as Saudi would be, but he should be sitting back and relaxing right now after the rigours of a tough season. Yes, get out of United, but take your time about it.",
      "The main argument against Bruno Fernandes leaving Manchester United comes from his perceived importance to everything the team does. However, if we translate that to league form, what does that actually mean? The difference between finishing 15th and 17th?",
      "United need a summer rebuild - that much is obvious. They'll need to sell in order to buy after missing out on Europe and there's only one member of their squad who can fetch the big one-off fee to accelerate that process.",
      "He's already given his best years to the club, and they're some way from being back in a position of being competitive at the top end of the league. By the time that happens (if it happens?), who knows how big a toll that average of 53 games per season for five straight years will have taken.",
      "Sure, United might miss Fernandes in the short term. As we've seen with Paris Saint-Germain post-Kylian Mbappe and Liverpool post-Phillipe Coutinho in recent years, though, forcing yourself to spread out the creative responsibilities can sometimes be the best way forward.",
      "Fernandes should go. He can only do so much in Manchester and he's about to find out that Amorim's system may not be overly inclusive of him as a player. Without a natural No.10 spot and more demands placed on positions, Fernandes may struggle to perform the role his manager wants.",
      "While I think he should leave the Red Devils, I'm not a lover of players heading to Saudi in their pomp, but heads get turned when mammoth sums are on offer, so it is understandable. It may not do much for his career but would be very kind to his bank balance.",
      "Fernandes has just had one of his best years to date and it got United absolutely nowhere, so it proves that one fantastic individual cannot solve a magnitude of problems. He's given it his all but a new challenge would certainly benefit him and the Middle East may be his only option."

      "United formally announced Cunha's capture on Sunday, releasing a statement to confirm that they had met the Brazilian's release clause.",

      "\"The 26 year-old has 13 senior caps for Brazil, and, in his club career, has made 270 appearances and scored 72 goals in the English, Spanish, German and Swiss top flights. During two-and-a-half seasons at Wolves, Cunha has scored 33 goals in 92 appearances.",
      "\"Everyone at Manchester United looks forward to welcoming Matheus to Old Trafford.\"",
      "Shortly after the terms of the deal were confirmed, Fernandes took to Instagram to welcome Cunha to the club. The Portugal star shared a a video of the club's announcement with the message: \"Welcome to Old Trafford @cunha\".",

      "Bruno Fernandes' days as a Manchester United player could be numbered with Al-Hilal offering huge sums to lure the player to Saudi Arabia. The skipper has excelled since the appointment of Ruben Amorim, but a move is not out of the question.",
      "Around £100million could come United's way if they choose to cash in, whilst the player himself could land weekly sums of £700,000. The Saudi outfit want to add a star name to their squad before the Club World Cup this month - and will spend big to do so.",
      "Their interest in Fernandes has been ongoing and it leaves the player and his club with a decision to make. Amid the need for a rebuild, Unitedr could massively benefit from the cash injection.",
      "Fernandes will also turn 31 later this year and there continues to be question marks over whether he truly fits into Amorim 's system once he gets the players he wants.",
      "His output this season has been sensational, albeit largely in a losing effort. United have endured a dire campaign and they missed out on Europe when they were beaten in the Europa League final. That has placed even more strain on the club's financial situation.",
      "However Amorim has told United chiefs to find other ways of making money rather than selling their star man, despite the player himself seriously considering the offer he has in front of him.",
      "Amorim claims, through conversations with Fernandes, that the Portugal star wants to stay put. He said: \"Of course I am the manager, the coach, but sometimes it is the decision of the player, but of course I talk with him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",
      "Fernandes has been spotted dining with Portugal pal Joao Cancelo - who has been dubbed a \"secret agent\" by fans as the former Manchester City full-back looks to convince the United star to join him at Al-Hilal, where fellow Portugal international Ruben Neves is also in the squad.",
      "Well his agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with senior Al Hilal individuals and those in Saudi see it as a positive sign that discussions have been held.",
      "Paul Scholes is among those who admits the sort of sums being offered cannot be turned down. He admitted: \"When you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "Fernandes has admitted he would leave Old Trafford if United decided it was in their best interests to cash in. “If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is,” he said. “And football sometimes is like this. I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.\"",
      "His social media activity has also served to fuel the rumour mill. He recently posted a Portuguese quote on his social media account which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "Well they are are lining up Sporting Lisbon’s attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves as the man to fill the void that could be left by Fernandes. The Red Devils would have the finances to meet Sporting’s £70m valuation of Goncalves if they do cash in.",
      "Goncalves plays in a more advanced role than Fernandes after Amorim transformed him into a potent attacking midfielder throughout their time together in Portugal. He can also play out wide, which gives the team more versatility.",
      "The £100m they would receive would also help them improve other areas of the pitch. Meanwhile the £62.5m capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves goes someway to replacing the goals and assists provided by Fernandes - and there's an argument that the Brazilian better suits the 3-4-3 system in Manchester.",

Garnacho appears to have fallen out with manager Ruben Amorim after being benched for the Europa League final defeat against Tottenham - and left out altogether for the final day clash against Aston Villa.",
      "Garnacho is the latest player to have clashed with Amorim after Marcus Rashford, with both players struggling to deliver on their promise after being dropped by Amorim at various points this season.",
      "Rashford is almost certain to depart if United can identify a club who will pay their £40million asking price, while Garnacho is also expected to leave after Amorim reportedly told him he must \"pray\" he could find a new team. After their Europa League loss to Spurs, Garnacho admitted his frustration over not being picked and said the team's season was \"s***\".",
      "Souness - who played 354 times for the Reds before managing them for three years in the 1990s - feels both players are examples of a poor culture in the dressing room and said there was \"too much money and respect\" influencing young players.",
      "\"The fact Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Manchester United underlines why I have persistently said he is a classic example of a young player who has had too much too soon,\" he told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"That's too much admiration, too much money, too much respect from within the football club and too much from outside, from the public. It puts players like him in a headspace that is detrimental to their growth as a human being and as a football player. It's compounded by the fact he is at Manchester United where a player's profile, even before he has even appeared regularly for the club, is bigger and wider than with any other club in the country.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford, has one season of scoring 30 goals and what does the club do? Give him over £300,000 a week. Look at how that has worked out.\"",
      "Souness claimed there weren't enough experienced leaders in the dressing room to help Garnacho stay grounded and cited Cristiano Ronaldo as a player who the youngster could have benefited learning more from. He insisted when he was a player, he felt \"insignificant\" despite being club captain, because manager Ronnie Moran kept them on their toes.",
      "\"You often hear United managers talk about the culture being wrong. Who does Garnacho have to look up to in that dressing room, that is setting an example? Someone he would want to become. They had the best example in the world and let him go: Cristiano Ronaldo. He would have been worth keeping for the example he set. Staying on after training, dedicating his lifestyle to the sport.",
      "\"At Liverpool you were never allowed to have a big head on your shoulders. That's why I cite Ronnie Moran as the greatest influence on my career. I was captain of Liverpool, but I felt insignificant. Statistics tell you we were pretty good, but Ronnie never let us become 'Billy Big Heads'.\"",
      "Garnacho is now being linked with a move to Chelsea after returning from the club's post-season tour to Asia. The 20-year-old made it clear he was unhappy to travel after uploading a picture of the airport runway after getting back home, with the caption: \"Finally\".",
      "Napoli have also been mentioned as an interested party in the player who managed 10 goals and nine assists in all competitions for United this season.",

      "McAtee has enjoyed moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself. He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League, but won't get the chance to rub shoulders with the squad's senior stars at the FIFA tournament.",
      "As a result potential suitors are beginning to circle and one of those is the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move, especially as McAtee is tipped to have a bright future.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Guardiola's decision to overlook him could spell the end of his time on the blue side of Manchester. The Catalan has been honest about the state of affairs and whilst he wants to keep the 22-year-old, he would understand his desire to play regularly.",
      "He said in April: “For the age, I’d like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don’t know how the squad will be and we will see.”",
      "Another factor at play is that McAtee’s contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The academy graduate has excelled on loan in the Championship previously, but would command a higher move were he to head away from the Etihad.",
      "McAtee himself is keen on a move to the Bundesliga, where he's been linked with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen. He's seen first-hand how young English players have thrived in the Germany environment with Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham among them.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United star Marcus Rashford that new £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha will take the No.10 shirt at Old Trafford. Cunha, 26, has officially left Wolves and joined the Red Devils on a five-year contract until June 2030 which includes the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "United announced the forward's arrival on Sunday afternoon, having been spotted staying at The Lowry Hotel in Manchester with his family. Cunha will now link up with his international team-mates in Brazil before returning to England for pre-season training following a brief holiday.",
      "By then, Rashford could've left boyhood club United. The 27-year-old is up for sale after spending the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "There's been no indication that Villa will trigger their option to buy Rashford for £40million, the price which United are demanding from other suitors. Barcelona have held talks with his agent and brother, Dwaine Maynard, but the newly-crowned La Liga champions would prefer a loan deal.",
      "It's been reported that regardless of Rashford's future, Cunha will take his No.10 shirt. The United academy product has worn the number since 2018 but according to Ferdinand's information, it now belongs to Cunha after he wore the same number for Wolves and former club Hertha Berlin.",
      "Reacting to Cunha's lucrative arrival, Ferdinand told his TikTok followers: \"One of the few players I mentioned a few weeks ago, if I had a shopping list, he would be on there. He knows the Premier League, so he doesn't need any adaptation time.",
      "\"This is a huge factor. I think if you're going to go and buy players from foreign leagues, players that don't have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk. He has the experience here. We've seen him here. He grew up a Man United fan.",
      "\"I'm hearing he's taking the No 10 shirt, which was Rashford's shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford? I don't know. There are a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well.",
      "\"Seventeen goals, six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team, I think it's impressive. I think the recruitment team for Manchester United would have seen, and the coaches here would have seen, what he did to Man United at Old Trafford.

      "The race for Viktor Gyokeres is starting to heat up - but the Sweden international will not be joining Barcelona this summer, says the Spanish champions' sporting director, Deco.",
      "Gyokeres, 26, has plundered goals at a remarkable rate since joining Sporting Lisbon on a free transfer from Coventry City two years ago. And with the striker now ready to move on, he has no shortage of suitors across Europe, including in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are among the clubs who are weighing up a blockbuster summer move as they seek attacking reinforcements ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "And their chances of landing Gyokeres have been given a significant boost by Deco, who has confirmed Barcelona will not be attempting to sign the prolific striker this summer.",
      "\"Gyokeres is a great striker who did excellent things at Sporting but we’re currently not looking for that position,\" Deco said, per A Bola. \"We have [Robert] Lewandowski at number nine.\"",
      "Arsenal will spend big on a new No.9 this summer after finishing second in the Premier League for a third successive year, though it remains to be seen if they will pursue a deal for Gyokeres or for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",

      "There was once a time where Manchester United had the free rein to hand-pick the Premier League's best talent without any questions asked.",
      "However, their regression over the past 12 years has meant that luxury has somewhat subsided. Much of their recruitment has been of a scattergun approach and their hit record in the transfer market has been low.",
      "Nevertheless, United made it their mission to make a statement on day one of this summer's transfer window, getting a deal over the line for Wolves ace Matheus Cunha on Sunday.",
      "Subject to a visa and registration being granted, he will join the club on a five-year deal, featuring the option of an additional year, after United triggered his £62.5million release clause. The fee will be paid in instalments.",
      "United identified Cunha as one of their top targets several months ago, meaning to have secured his signature less than 24 hours after the transfer window had opened must have been of great comfort to head coach Ruben Amorim, who will be keen to make fast progress this summer.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10, meaning he is tailor-made for the role Amorim wants him to fill at Old Trafford. The general expectation is that he will occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Amorim's first-choice XI.",
      "The Brazilian has joined United on the back of a highly successful season at Wolves that saw him score 17 goals and register six assists in 36 appearances across all competitions. Of his 17 goals, 15 were plundered in the Premier League.",
      "Taking his tally from 2023/24 into account, Cunha, 26, will arrive at Old Trafford having scored 27 goals in his last two Premier League campaigns, meaning he possesses a proven record in the division.",
      "In each of the last two summer transfer windows, United turned to Italy to strengthen their attacking options, signing Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta in August 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna in July 2024. Both players were recruited based on their potential.",
      "United signed five players from overseas last summer, with Zirkzee their only attacking signing. Just as they had needed to 12 months earlier, they needed to recruit an attacker with Premier League experience to beef up their attacking pool and they failed to do so.",
      "With the exception of Ayden Heaven arriving from Arsenal in February, Mason Mount being drafted in from Chelsea in July 2023 and Christian Eriksen being signed following a short-term stint at Brentford in July 2022, domestic signings on a permanent basis have not been as frequent as they once were in recent years, particularly in an attacking sense.",
      "Having signed Mount to play in the centre of midfield in a 4-3-3 formation, United, prior to confirming Cunha's arrival, had not signed an attacking player from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent deal since recruiting Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "Sanchez was one of two statement signings added to United's pool of forwards that season, with Romelu Lukaku arriving from Everton six months earlier.",
      "Sanchez had scored eight goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign for Arsenal, fresh from scoring 30 goals the previous season, and Lukaku arrived in M16 ahead of the 2017/18 season on the back of a 26-goal season for Everton.",
      "Although neither player managed to forge long careers for themselves at Old Trafford, with many suggesting they were the right players signed at the wrong time, they were signings of the right profile, with United hoping they would come in and hit the ground running.",
      "Lukaku scored 27 goals in his debut season at United, including 16 in 34 Premier League games. He made the immediate impact United need a new striker signing to make next season.",
      "Of course, there is absolutely no guarantee the signing of Cunha will work out in the way United hope it will. The same can be said of every managerial appointment every club makes. The one guarantee football can offer is that nothing is guaranteed.",
      "Nevertheless, the fact United have recruited a ready-made Premier League operator to bolster their attack is a step in the right direction. They frequently raided their Premier League counterparts for their best attackers during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday, signing the likes of Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Dimitar Berbatov, Robin van Persie, who all made their mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Non-attacking signings plucked from Premier League counterparts included the likes of Edwin van der Sar Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick. That approach, albeit in a different era, rarely let United down."

      "The deal ticked almost every box and it was announced on Sunday, the opening day of the summer window. Cunha will officially seal his transfer when he returns from international duty and his visa is approved, but United will be relieved to get him through the door at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "The reality is that most negotiations for transfers aren't as straightforward because a club could be reluctant to sell, a player might need to be persuaded, or personal demands could be an issue.",
      "There are plenty of moving parts. United walked away from signing Moises Caicedo before he signed for Brighton due to his agent's demands, for example.",
      "Now Cunha has been wrapped up, United will turn their attention to other targets and it's almost guaranteed their next signing will be more complicated than the first.",
      "Talks to sign Cunha from Wolves were plain sailing. Signing a striker won't be as simple.",
      "Liam Delap has already decided to join Chelsea, who will activate his £30m relegation clause, and United will now move on to other targets after missing out on the 22-year-old.",
      "Victor Omsihen ticks most boxes, just like Cunha did, although his wage demands caused his proposed transfer to Chelsea to collapse last summer and the indication is they could be a problem again.",
      "Ineos have lowered the United wage bill since gaining control of football operations and won't pay a huge salary to Osimhen. However, he might be a player worth compromising on.",
      "The new wage structure won't be completely ripped up to accommodate Osimhen, but United need a proven goalscorer and striker is arguably the most important position on the pitch. Ruben Amorim needs goals and Ineos chiefs must decide what price they are willing to pay to deliver them.",
      "United's identification of Delap as their prime target suggests they are taking a different approach. He is young with considerable upside and would have been attainable for a value fee.",
      "Osimhen feels like a signing that the previous decision-makers at Old Trafford would have approved, but the importance of signing a proven goalscorer cannot be understated.",
      "If Osimhen is overlooked, then perhaps Viktor Gyökeres could be a suitable alternative, given he has built an impressive goalscoring record and worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyökeres already has experience of English football after developing in the Championship with Coventry, he is 26-years-old and will reportedly be available for £60m this summer.",
      "Osimhen and Gyökeres would be great additions, albeit challenging for United to get over the line for different reasons (Osimhen's wage demands and rival interest in Gyökeres).",
      "Furthermore, the elephant in the room is that United are not particularly attractive for new signings. They have just endured the worst campaign in the club's modern history, finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to qualify for European football, so there is not a huge amount of appeal.",
      "Napoli want to sell Osimhen because he's not in Antonio Conte's plans, but Gyökeres has just won the league with Sporting and they will compete in the Champions League again next season.",
      "Gyökeres may feel it's better for him to stick than twist. Are United the right club for his next move?",

      "Manchester United made the perfect start to the summer transfer window on Sunday, announcing the arrival of Wolves star Matheus Cunha on a long-term contract.",
      "Subject to a visa and registration being granted, the Brazilian has joined United on a five-year deal after the club agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause. He also has the option of an additional year.",
      "United had been tracking the former Atletico Madrid man for some time after identifying him as one of their top targets to strengthen the squad ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals across all competitions for Wolves this season, including 15 in the Premier League, and will sharpen a blunt United attack. The Reds have ended each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "However, to ensure they give themselves the best possible chance of increasing their attacking output next term, United want to add to the addition of Cunha by signing a striker.",
      "Like the Brazilian, United had long since identified Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap as a priority target, but he is now on the brink of finalising a move to Chelsea. Delap held talks with a handful of clubs and chose a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It means United's search for a new goal-getter will head in an alternative direction, although it remains unclear who they plan to try and recruit instead. Napoli ace Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres are both continuing to be linked with moves to M16.",
      "United, at this juncture, need an experienced and proven striker that come in and hit the ground running. As tempting and as understandable a move for Delap, who was available via a £30m release clause, was, swooping for him would have signified a huge gamble after just one season as a regular Premier League starter.",
      "United gambled on potential in both 2023 and 2024, signing Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee respectively, but neither of them have done enough to justify leading United's attack, hence why the club is once again on the hunt for a striker.",
      "As well as bolstering their attack, United are also understood to be in the market for a new midfielder. Christian Eriksen will leave the club at the end of this month when his contract expires and neither Kobbie Mainoo or Casemiro are assured of a future at Old Trafford beyond the end of this summer.",
      "Casemiro is approaching the final year of his contract and Mainoo did not play as regularly as he would have liked this season. The club is also yet to reach an agreement with him over a new contract.",
      "The addition of a new right wing-back at Old Trafford cannot be dismissed this summer, either. Prior to it being confirmed in March that Geovany Quenda will join Chelsea next summer, United had expressed interest in the Sporting Lisbon youngster.",
      "The addition of a wing-back, at this juncture, is unlikely to rank as a top priority amid the overriding importance of strengthening the attack. Furthermore, United's intentions for the remainder of the summer are likely to rest on outgoings and raising funds via player sales."

      "With Matheus Cunha's signature secured, Manchester United's focus must now turn to signing a striker.",
      "Following several months worth of speculation, United announced the signing of Cunha on Sunday, subject to him securing a visa and registration. He has signed a five-year deal with the option of an additional year.",
      "United had long since identified Cunha as their primary target to strengthen their No.10 options and they agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause.",
      "However, having missed out on Liam Delap, United's search for a striker is not going to be as simple. Delap, who is on the cusp of joining Chelsea from Ipswich Town, was also attainable via a release clause.",
      "But attainable strikers appear are going to be few and far between this summer, meaning United could struggle to sign one. However, failing to sign one between now and the September 1 deadline is simply a non-negotiable for a team that has finished the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Ideally, United will secure the services of an established and proven goalscorer who can come in and hit the ground running. Strikers of that ilk, however, cost a pretty penny.",
      "Having failed to secure Champions League qualification for next term, United's starting transfer budget is not as healthy as it would have been had they beaten Tottenham in Bilbao almost a fortnight ago.",
      "Therefore, it means United's hopes of signing a proven goal-getter will rest on raising funds via player sales. United want to cut their cloth this summer and have plans to shelve Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony among others.",
      "Bruno Fernandes continues to be linked with Al-Hilal and an impending offer of £100m has been mooted. If United can raise enough money via the seller's market, regardless if it means losing Fernandes or not, they need to source an elite-level goalscorer.",
      "Few have been linked with United more often than Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres in the last few months, and his goalscoring record is impressive to say the very least. He has scored 97 goals in 102 games since arriving from Coventry City in July 2023.",
      "Gyokeres joined Sporting on the back of an impressive 2022/23 campaign for the Sky Blues in which he scored 23 goals and registered 12 assists.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, and it felt inevitable that he would move to one of them given he was available for somewhere in the region of £20m. Therefore, it was a big surprise when he moved to Portugal.",
      "However, Gyokeres' agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, later revealed it was because of now-United head coach Ruben Amorim that he moved to the Portuguese capital.",
      "\"Everyone was waiting for Viktor to sign with a Premier League club,\" Cetinkaya said. \"And the answer to that question is that I brought Viktor to Sporting for just one reason, and this is also something I said to Mr Amorim when I saw him for the first time, and I said it before I even said hello to him: I only brought my player here because of you.",
      "\"Therefore, I only brought Gyokeres to Sporting because of Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Gyokeres, of course, thrived under Amorim prior to the latter's switch to United last November, scoring 66 goals in 68 appearances under his stewardship. As a result, if the opportunity arose for him to be reunited with the United boss, Gyokeres would surely give it serious consideration.",
      "He excelled under his coaching methods, and his record in front of goal over the last two seasons makes him an attractive option for the Reds. However, the elephant in the room is that United do not have any form of European football to offer for next season.",
      "Gyokeres impressed in the Champions League this term, scoring six times in eight games, meaning he would be within his rights to want to play in the competition again next season if was to leave Sporting this summer.",

      "\"It’s not easy to find a player like that these days.\" If this message does not spark Ineos and their recruitment team into life, nothing will.",
      "Lewandowski has spelt it out plain and simply for United. There is a lack of quality centre-forward options in world football so a player of Gyokeres' ability is unlikely to be available again for a price that the Reds can afford.",
      "Yes, £67m is a lot for a player who turns 27 on Wednesday but his prowess could be invaluable next season when the pressure on Ruben Amorim is hiked up further still. There really is not many options at centre-forward in world football this summer and if United miss out on a Gyokeres, they could be destined to repeat another doomed season."

      "It was only last summer that United brought Joshua Zirkzee to Old Trafford from Bologna, while Rasmus Hojlund was signed a year earlier in 2023.

      "The Toffees turned down two offers for the 22-year-old from United last summer. Neither bid, with the second one being a package worth around £50m, came anywhere near meeting the Merseyside club's valuation of a player who had an outstanding breakthrough year.",
      "According to our sister title the Liverpool ECHO, the likelihood of United coming back 12 months later has lessened after their failure to qualify for Champions League football but the player still has admirers at Old Trafford, while interest from Tottenham Hotspur, whose Europa League final victory over United secured a spot in Europe's top competition, is believed to be serious.",
      "Chelsea are also thought to be considering a move for Branthwaite, though it is Spurs whose interest is perceived to be stronger at this early stage of the transfer window.",

      "Branthwaite, who broke into the first team in the early stages of the 2023/24 season, is contracted to Everton until June 2027, having signed a new deal. As a result, Everton, who acquired him from Carlisle United in 2020, are well-positioned to fend off any speculative interest.",
      "The player himself is reportedly happy on Merseyside and grateful for the opportunities Everton have given him - and can continue to provide with the move to the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",

      "Should a high-profile offer be rejected, there would likely be expectations for contract negotiations reflecting the club's valuation of him, considering his current deal was structured around his status as an emerging star within the Everton squad.",
      "Given that Branthwaite was acquired for a mere £1m, any sale would be significant from Everton's standpoint concerning the league's Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR).",
      "The aftermath of previous challenging years will continue to influence the club's PSR figures leading up to the June 30 deadline. However, from the start of the new football financial year on July 1, Everton should have more leeway to be ambitious in the transfer market.",
      "The club's financial prospects have improved since last summer, thanks to the stability brought by The Friedkin Group following their takeover completion in December."

      "His scathing reply on talkSPORT criticised the impact of the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR), stating: \"This is the downside of PSR. This is what we're doing to our domestic football clubs, that they have to sell their players to be able to meet PSR.",
      "\"So whether it's an academy player, whether it's a better player, like at Aston Villa, this is the downside of PSR. So if we keep on with this nonsense, we will unwind the domestic powerhouse that our Premier League is and start to denigrate the quality of our football clubs. Rules could undermine the Premier League's status and diminish the quality of English clubs.",

      "Manchester United have completed their first signing of the summer transfer window, bringing Matheus Cunha in from Wolves for a £62.5m deal.",
      "The Brazilian forward was the player of the season in a Wolves team that flirted with relegation in the campaign just gone, scoring 17 times and clocking up six assists. He has signed a five-year contract with United, plus an option for another year.",
      "Cunha's strong and competitive personality will be a good addition to a team that are feeling battered and bruised after a nightmare of a season, though that personality has led to disciplinary issues on the pitch. He is likely to be a No.10 for Ruben Amorim, supporting whoever gets the nod to come and be United's new striker this summer after £30m Liam Delap opted to focus on a move to Chelsea.",
      "It has even been suggested that Cunha could follow in the footsteps of United icon Eric Cantona, while for some fans, the £62.5m signing, which will be a spread out over two instalments, is an opportunity to start putting the past season behind them. Reader Dravic says: \"A very encouraging start to the transfer window. A priority signing, plays a position and role we are desperately in need of. He's a Premier League proven player and goalscorer, he wants to play for us, and all wrapped up within hours of a transfer window starting. I'm starting to think we might actually have a plan for this transfer window!\"",
      "Panchopearson agrees: \"Will this be a good signing? We will have to wait and see but Ineos have moved quickly again in the transfer market which they did last season. In my opinion, they have made some really good signings. Yoro, Mazraoui and Heaven. I am also a fan of De Ligt and Ugarte and Dorgu, and hopefully they will improve next season. The jury is still out on Zirkzee and we will have to wait and see if he is here next season. The biggest problem will be getting rid of ETH's signings!\"",
      "Commenter Vs777 writes: \"It's the first time in a long time we've signed someone that early. It's a good sign.\" IlSacristano adds: \"Welcome Cunha. Wishing you all success at United.\"",
      "Tt84 says: \"Well well well. First signing of the season - proven PL player. Improvement on what we have, boxed off within a week of the end of the season. I don't think for one minute we are fixed, I also don't think for one minute we will make the CL next season. But it does feel like a corner has been turned.\"",
      "Manutd75 wants to see more swift action: \"Hope Ineos have a plan to get these transfers in/ out early. They forced Amorim and his project in earlier than he had planned. Amorim says they have a plan with and without Europe. All we can hope is that they can fund it. 'Now or never', Ineos. In: Cunha, Leon, TBD...\"",
      "Jasper JH says: \"Good signing, as long as we can stop him elbowing and headbutting people.\" Toff68 writes: \"Could be the Cantona signing? The catalyst to our return to the top!\"",
      "Realredmanc says: \"A great signing, and a showing of our intentions to rebuild, after a terrible two seasons. Other potential signings will be more likely to sign for us after this.\"",

      "The Italian press says Matt Hargreaves met with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and discussed a potential swap deal involving Osimhen and Rasmus Hojlund during the exchange.",
      "Take it with a pinch of salt, but a swap deal to sign Osimhen would make sense, especially now Liam Delap has chosen to sign for Chelsea. United wanted to sign Delap from Ipswich Town, although it was inevitable that failing to qualify for European football next season would influence his thinking.",
      "Many will argue Delap shouldn't have been the preferred striker target in the first place because United need a proven goalscorer, and Delap has just one season in the Premier League.",
      "Osimhen does not have experience in England, but his scoring record has been impressive throughout his career and he is the closest thing to a guarantee of goals in the transfer market.",
      "The Nigerian scored 76 goals in 133 games for Napoli and played a key role in their 2022/23 Serie A title triumph with 26 goals. Although his form dropped off as Napoli finished 10th and had three different managers, he regained momentum during his time on loan in Turkey this term.",
      "Osimhen was sent on loan to Galatasaray because Chelsea were in talks to sign him last August, only to fail to agree personal terms and the move dramatically fell through at the 11th hour.",
      "The transfer window slammed shut and Osimhen was left stranded at Napoli, yet he needed a move away because Antonio Conte had decided he was not in his plans in Naples.",
      "Napoli failed to offload Osimhen permanently last summer, but history won't repeat itself. Osimhen will be sold and a swap deal might tick a lot of boxes for all the parties involved.",
      "Hojlund was signed from Atalanta and would return to a league he already knows. Napoli would receive a transfer fee along with Hojlund. In return, United would finally add a proven striker to their squad.",
      "It would be an ideal outcome, although it's probably wishful thinking and United might not be happy to stump up a fee, and include Hojlund in a deal, to bring Osimhen to Manchester.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea. Around £30m and Hojlund would reportedly be entertained for a sensational swap deal.",
      "There is also the issue of Osimhen's wage demands. They are rarely a problem in football, but the striker's demands were too much for Chelsea last summer and could be a stumbling block again.",
      "Osimhen is said to be demanding huge wages and Ineos have lowered the wage bill since gaining control of football operations, so he would have to compromise to sign for United.",
      "Ruben Amorim needs a striker who can consistently find the back of the net and players like Osimhen are not easily attainable very often, which means United must do everything they can to sign him.",
      "All options should be on the table, including creative transfers like potential swap deals."

      "During the clash at Old Trafford, Cunha was seen sharing a moment with Ruben Amorim at half-time which fuelled speculation that a move to United could be on the horizon. And so it proved as the Reds announced the deal on Sunday, June 1 - the first day of the summer transfer window.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised Kobbie Mainoo a return to his preferred position if he extends his Manchester United deal while the Red Devils ‘line up’ a replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United chiefs are working hard to bolster an ailing Manchester United squad that finished 15th in the Premier League under Amorim and failed to secure European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m move from Wolves is imminent, but there is far more work to do this summer amid rumours of several high-profile exits.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told by Amorim that he has no future at the club, while Fernandes is in talks over a big-money move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal having offered to fall on his sword at the end of the season.",
      "The future of academy star Mainoo is also up in the air as he is yet to extend his contract amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "The England international was used sparingly by Amorim in the second half of the season, leading to suggestions he could push for the exit, with United reportedly open to his ‘pure profit’ sale.",
      "But GIVEMESPORT claim the club is still in talks with the 20-year-old over a new deal and Mainoo  ‘will be given the chance to return to his favoured central midfield role even though Amorim previously had trust issues if he is persuaded to sign on the dotted line in the coming months’.",
      "It’s claimed he’s ‘on course to be one of the first names on the teamsheet’ if he extends his contract, with Amorim planning to use him in one of the two central midfield positions in his 3-4-3 despite deploying him further forward in his debut season in charge.",
      "The GMS report adds:",
      "‘Manchester United are using contract negotiations to be very open with Mainoo about his role and how he can fit in, GMS sources have learned, while they have made it clear that they want to work with him on a plan to elevate his traits and get the best out of him instead of cashing in.",
      "‘GMS sources have been told that Manchester United are eager to make Mainoo faster, stronger and more combative as a central midfielder as it has been acknowledged that upgrading his talent would solve a problem after they have been struggling to find the cash to spend on Atalanta’s Ederson.’",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils aren’t actively looking to sell him, even if their £70m valuation is met, and will only agree to his departure if Mainoo himself ‘agitates for a move’ to Chelsea – who ‘wait in the wings’ – or to another interested suitor.",
      "With Mainoo set to move back into central midfield, Amorim is keen to add another No.10 to his ranks on top of Cunha.",
      "And Mirror claim the Red Devils are ‘lining up’ Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves as their replacement for Fernandes.",
      "The 26-year-old was brilliant for the Portuguese side under Amorim, who pushed him into a more advanced role having spotted his potential goals at a pre-season training camp in 2020.",
      "Goncalves has managed 82 goals and 52 assists from the left and right of the central striker in 198 appearances for Sporting and reportedly has a price tag of around £70m.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",
      "Should Man Utd sell Bruno Fernandes? The fans are split. We also have views on the new Man Utd manager, Spurs and more.",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal think an ‘agreement is close’ for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes amid one ‘key factor’.",
      "Manchester United have been told by Danny Murphy that the consequences will be “devastating” if their best player leaves this summer amid heavy Saudi threat.",
      "Real Madrid legend Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly told Al-Hilal that they will need to sign Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join."

      "Is there a curse on Premier League transfers above £70million? Arsenal’s record signing Declan Rice has helped to buck the trend and the improvement of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez has improved this list – but it’s still pretty grim.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70million or more.",
      "",
      "17) Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea\nChelsea bought Romelu Lukaku for the second time in 2021, splashing out £97.5m on the Belgian, who was handed another chance to make his mark at Stamford Bridge. He had spent time on loan at West Brom and Everton during his first spell, playing the best football of his Premier League career for the latter.",
      "After a successful permanent move to the Toffees, Lukaku joined Manchester United for big money (more on that soon), before moving to Inter and then returning to Chelsea. Many – F365 included – expected him to be the signing of the season, but he flopped disastrously, digging his own grave by publicly begging Inter to re-sign him.",
      "An ill-advised interview with Sky Italia effectively ended his Chelsea career. He at least earned a loan back to Inter in 2022/23, spent 2023/24 at Roma, and finally departed for good last summer when he signed for Napoli for around £20m.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho to Manchester United\nManchester United have made some absolute howlers in the transfer market, and Sancho is among the worst. The Red Devils chased the England winger for over a year while he was at Borussia Dortmund before eventually landing him for £73m in 2021.",
      "Fast forward four years and Sancho is finished at Old Trafford. After a productive loan spell back at Dortmund, he joined Conference League winners Chelsea on loan for 2024/25. United stand to make around £25m from a sale.",
      "Arguably the most costly example of ‘Bundesliga tax’, Sancho never found his rhythm for United and any hope of revival disappeared after a public fallout with Erik ten Hag.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Alexis, Antony in bottom two, Solskjaer buy top",
      "",
      "15) Antony to Manchester United\nAntony cost a ridiculous £80m during Ten Hag’s first summer at United, with Ajax pocketing a huge fee after the Red Devilsleft it late in the 2022 window.",
      "Known for his flair and his wand of a left foot, Antony scored on his debut against Arsenal, but it was downhill from there. He has more yellow cards (14) than goals (12) or assists (5) in 96 appearances for the Red Devils. Even without the numbers, he’s looked nowhere near a £70m+ player.",
      "His value has crashed to £16.6m on Transfermarkt, and United would’ve been lucky to get even that before his successful loan at Real Betis. Nine goals and five assists in 26 games have raised his stock, but United will still make a massive loss when he inevitably moves on this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez to Liverpool\nDarwin Nunez is definitely at the right club in terms of fanbase. Liverpool supporters embraced him from day one, making him one of their own. On the pitch, though, he has often looked lost.",
      "Roberto Firmino wasn’t a prolific scorer but made Jurgen Klopp’s side tick – something Darwin has not done. At 26, time is still on his side, but he remains frustratingly raw. Arne Slot appears to have run out of patience, and a summer exit beckons.",
      "",
      "13) Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea\nStill the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, Kepa joined Chelsea for a staggering £72m in 2018.",
      "Since then, he’s lost his Spain place, been replaced by Edouard Mendy – who was signed for around £56m less – and briefly regained his spot, only to lose it again. At one point, it looked like his Chelsea career was over.",
      "Somehow, he found himself as Real Madrid’s No.1 for part of 2023/24 and then shone at Bournemouth this term. He’ll likely join the south coast club permanently. He never justified his fee, but he has at least salvaged his reputation.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal\nPepe cost Arsenal £72m in 2019. There was talk that Unai Emery preferred Wilfried Zaha, but was handed Pepe instead. This Arsenal fan was thrilled at the time. Poor, yet devilishly handsome, sod.",
      "Pepe is widely seen as a flop, but he did have moments. He was crucial in the 2020 FA Cup win, contributing in the semi-final and final. Eighteen goal contributions in his debut season wasn’t awful, just not what you’d want from a big-money signing.",
      "In 2020/21, he hit 21 goal involvements – including 10 league goals – and came second in Arsenal’s Player of the Year vote. But the Gunners finished eighth, so, yeah. He returned to France with Nice, and his contract was terminated in 2023 after no Saudi takers emerged.",
      "",
      "11) Harry Maguire to Manchester United\nSigned for £80m from Leicester in 2019, Maguire did well enough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be handed the captaincy – which only added to the pressure already weighing him down.",
      "That pressure might explain his struggles. His resurgence in 2023/24, after being stripped of the armband, suggests as much. £80m was clearly too much, but he hasn’t been that bad.",
      "",
      "10) Paul Pogba to Manchester United\nWhat a player on his day. Pogba returned to United in 2016 for a world-record £89m after being released by the club four years earlier.",
      "His first season was actually very good – nine goals, six assists, and two trophies under Jose Mourinho. He scored in the Europa League final win over Ajax. But that was as good as it got.",
      "He posted decent numbers in 17/18 and 18/19 but injuries and inconsistency plagued his second stint. He left again for free in 2022 and is currently a free agent due to a doping ban. A strange, often frustrating career.",
      "",
      "9) Wesley Fofana to Chelsea\nChelsea chased Fofana for a while before finally coughing up around £70m. There was even talk of him breaking Maguire’s record fee for a defender.",
      "He made just 17 Premier League appearances in 2022/23 and missed all of last season with yet another serious injury. After a promising start to 2024/25, he got injured and dropped down the pecking order behind Trevoh Chalobah and Levi Colwill.",
      "He hasn’t played since March and has only featured twice in 2025. Injuries are absolutely ruining his career.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United\nBetween Chelsea stints, Lukaku found himself at Old Trafford after United paid £75m following his prolific Everton spell (87 goals in 166 games).",
      "He never looked a good fit, but 55 goal contributions in 96 games isn’t terrible. And being sold for just £8m less than he cost keeps this spell off the disaster list.",
      "",
      "7) Kai Havertz to Chelsea\nChelsea paid £72m for Havertz and got a Champions League-winning goal out of it. That’s enough to secure his legacy, but the rest of his time in blue was underwhelming.",
      "They somehow sold him to Arsenal for £65m – a miracle, given his numbers. He’s found form again as a striker under Mikel Arteta, but in terms of Chelsea value for money, he just about breaks even.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea\nBritish record signing Enzo Fernandez joined in January 2023 for a reported £107m. He didn’t do much wrong – but didn’t do much, full stop – until Enzo Maresca arrived.",
      "After starring at the 2022 World Cup, Fernandez struggled under multiple managers, but 2024/25 saw him thrive. He’s still not quite justified the fee, but he’s well on the way.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League transfer overpays of all time includes two Man Utd players",
      "",
      "5) Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City\nCity usually nail transfers, especially big ones. Josko Gvardiol arrived as one of the best young defenders in the world, though early struggles led some to believe Nathan Ake was still first choice.",
      "But the Croatian adapted quickly and was arguably the Premier League’s best defender in the second half of 2023/24. He dipped slightly after that, but so did all of City. No cause for concern.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish to Manchester City\nCity paid £100m for Grealish, which is still eye-watering. He took time to adapt to Pep Guardiola’s system, and goal numbers remained modest – but he was vital in their Treble-winning season.",
      "Sixteen goal contributions in 2022/23 doesn’t tell the full story; he was key. However, after a disappointing 2024/25, a summer exit feels likely.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo to Chelsea\nCaicedo’s debut performance against West Ham could be described as catastrophic and it set the tone for an uncertain first few months.",
      "But slowly, Caicedo grew into the role. By the end of the 2023/24 season, he was a dependable, all-action midfield presence – and under Enzo Maresca, he’s been a revelation. His energy, tactical awareness and ball-winning ability make Chelsea tick, and while £115m still looks wild on paper, he’s been brilliant this season. Easily one of the best midfielders in the league.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice to Arsenal\nDeclan Rice has been sensational since joining Arsenal for £105m in the summer of 2023. Signed as a statement of intent, the England international has done more than justify the fee – he’s become the heartbeat of Arteta’s side.",
      "Whether deployed as a deep-lying six or a box-to-box eight, Rice has delivered elite performances. He reads the game superbly, breaks up play, leads by example and chips in with big goals – including a few belting free-kicks. His consistency and mentality have lifted Arsenal a level.",
      "This is the kind of transfer clubs dream of. No drama, no adaptation period, no regrets. Just class.",
      "",
      "1) Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool\nThis was never in doubt. Liverpool spent £76m on Virgil van Dijk in January 2018 and got one of the greatest defenders the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "His impact was instant. Liverpool went from leaky and flaky to serious contenders overnight. Within 18 months, they’d won the Champions League. Then came the Premier League title. Van Dijk became PFA Player of the Year, UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and finished second in the Ballon d’Or.",
      "More than the trophies or individual accolades, it’s the sheer authority he brought to Liverpool’s backline that stands out. Calm, dominant, and impossibly consistent – he remains the gold standard for defensive signings.",

      "The Tottenham board had been sympathetic to his cause earlier in the campaign with Spurs suffering an incredible amount of injuries that decimated Postecoglou’s squad.",
      "However, the negative results have continued since many of those players have returned with a large amount of supporters now turning on the manager too.",

      "",
      "17) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nWolves, Fulham and Sporting Lisbon have all been interested in the pocket rocket.",
      "",
      "16) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "15) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He is hot property ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "13) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",

      "",
      "10) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "9) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second relegation.",
      "",
      "8) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, and it looks like it might earn him a move to Strasbourg.",

      "2) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March. But the two parties are far enough apart to apparently alert Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, Virgil van Dijk and Declan Rice, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70m or more.",

Daniel Levy will have to dip in and spend £100-200M to get this squad to challenge at the top of the league. But even then, do you trust them to buy decent players with their track record?

      "Ronaldo is out of contract in Saudi Arabia at the end of June, and he recently hinted that his Al Nassr journey is coming to an end.",
      "He wrote on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”",

      "Transfer journalist Jorge Nicola reported that the 40-year-old has been offered “a percentage of shares”, with Textor eager to sign the Manchester United legend ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "“This offer includes the possibility of becoming a partner with John Textor in his clubs,” Nicola said.",
      "“Ronaldo continues to play at a very high level and Al-Nassr has suggested an extension there worth €16.5 million a month [£88m].",

      "What the hell were Manchester United doing in Malaysia? Are they mad? They should all be lying down in a dark room, trying to forget how bad they’ve been. It’s like they’re just pretending everything is normal when it’s an absolute bin fire. This is no way to run a business and certainly not a football club.",
      "It doesn’t take the wisdom of Solomon to realise a) earning £7.8million from a trip to Malaysia is peanuts which they routinely fritter away on poor players and which they could surely drum up through a commercial deal for United-endorsed pressed duck feet or something, b) they’ll ruin the brand further by losing games and playing poorly, c) the players will be exhausted and humiliated by being beaten, which means they’ll not be rested or inspired for a new season, meaning more failure, and d) there’s a limit to how much you can charge to see such a terrible team, putting off more fans than they can attract, making them feel resentful towards the club. Things are going downhill and fast, aided by Airhead Jim’s lack of basic business acumen.",
      "The club clearly sees the players like donkeys at the beach, forgetting that they are actually human. Does anyone think the best way to get over an appalling season is to get booed off in Malaysia? Actually booed off in Kuala Lumpur by people who had paid up to £260 to witness these sweating bodies being hopeless. These have been loyal followers, prepared to pay to see the club, even in the knowledge it likely won’t be the first team.",
      "That is no way to enhance your brand, to say the least. Do you think they’ll keep buying merchandise in these circumstances? You do, don’t you, Ratcliffe, you fool.",
      "Only a mean, insensitive cretin like thick-as-a-brick Jim would think this is a good idea. The manager obviously doesn’t have any confidence, saying, “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. I always feel guilty for the performance of the team since the first game I was here,” as he continues his ‘please sack me’ campaign in earnest.",
      "This sort of overseas tour fails to see that every season is just one part of every year; what you do in the summer influences what happens in the new campaign. Players don’t just reboot in mid-August and start fresh again and I really don’t think this is appreciated. Given that pre-season will start in mid-July and internationals are in the second week of June, they’ve all got about four weeks’ rest, unless Stupid Wurzel has got another trip planned, probably to the Arctic to play Eskimos.",
      "They obviously need a good rest and a re-set, not flogging even harder. They’re no good and don’t play well together, but it’s not a lack of games to blame. The football matters. It should be at the core but it seems almost incidental. Losing to sides you should easily beat just makes everything, on all levels, worse. Just playing terribly in more games isn’t going to make them improve. Even winning occasionally has proved to be nothing but a blip in a long-term trend.",
      "Failure is endemic and needs correcting from the boardroom to the pitch. And to do all this just after the season ended seems more akin to punishment. And don’t forget, players need to be sold and desperately. Given how mediocre they are, exposing their inadequacy is probably a bad idea if you want to get rid of them (and why wouldn’t you?) and want to get a decent price for them.",
      "They already have little or no leverage as it is; getting beaten in Malaysia just makes it easier for buyers to drive down the price, giving them less money to replace them with. How did this stupid actually become a billionaire?",
      "These things don’t take a degree in Business Studies to work out. It seems there is no limit to some people’s ability to see black as white as they go about their business, doubtless wondering who broke all the china in the shop and sh*t up the walls, completely unaware it’s them.",
      "It’s clear the people involved in driving this juggernaut don’t know where they’re going, haven’t even got a driving licence and are wearing a blindfold. Put more prosaically, they’re sh*te. The trouble is, they don’t realise, even as they plough the juggernaut into the sea. They think they’re great and can do no wrong, even as the once-great edifice crumbles to dust at their feet. Their delusion is total. But you can’t tell stupid people they’re stupid because they’re too stupid to understand.",
      "Their obsession with generating money is making them worse and effectively crippling them. I repeat, £7.8 million, that’s all they’re generating by doing this. That’s 10% of an Antony. It’ll pay a player’s wages for approximately four months. In return they get a knackered, demoralised squad and a devalued, reviled brand. Is it worth it? Only a fool would say yes. But that’s exactly who is in charge. Shambolic."

      "The pre-season targets can be viewed in full here, and the mid-season update here.",

      "In the end, they didn’t even manage the actual letter of the target either, their title race petering out in a sea of draws before they understandably switched their primary focus to the Champions League where, sure, they did win the Beating PSG on xG Cup but alas not the actual silverware we had tasked them with.",
      "The continued absence of trophies and a season of slight yet undeniable regression in the league made for a vaguely disappointing Arsenal season by current standards even before you factor in the fact Spurs did win a trophy and it is now Arsenal who must face the ‘Worra trophy’ jibes until they too win something.",
      "The good news is that we are very sure that will be next season and our predictions are famously Postecoglou-like in their accuracy.",

      "Tick and tick.

      "But overall it’s still a positive campaign as long as they don’t end up falling foul of any PSR unpleasantness down the line. Which they might.",
      "Managing a run to the Champions League quarter-finals – where they pushed PSG as close as anyone (sorry if that offends, Arsenal fans) – without completely losing the run of themselves domestically is an achievement unlocked, even if their rate of improvement over the last few years has been so rapid that this is already perhaps the last season in which they can get away with such minor ‘achievements’. Which is, of course, an achievement in itself.",

Marvellous.",

It’s also funny that despite winning none of their four games after being confirmed as champs that nobody really made a dent on their lead anyway.",
      "But the word of caution here is that while nobody gives a shiny sh*te about that four-match winless run right now, you’d better believe it will rapidly become Five Matches Without A Win and then a full-blown cracked-badge Six-Game Winless Streak should they make an untidy start to next season, because context is and always will be less important than content.",

      "Amorim and his team have already been set a target of finishing top six next season and at this point all we can really say is very best of luck to you with that while wondering/worrying if our 25/26 mid-season target for United really might end up being ‘Be proved right on Gareth Southgate’.",

      "Smashed it. Absolutely smashed it. Bit lucky on that final day to stumble home in fifth despite a home defeat to Everton, but a return to the Champions League and a first piece of major silverware that wasn’t in, well, black and white represents a season of success at the ‘manager gets a statue’ end of the scale.",
      "Blazed a trail that was followed by Crystal Palace and Tottenham ending their own absurd waits for trophies.",
      "As an aside, and while noting that none of this is Newcastle’s own fault, we have unfortunately been left with no choice but to take names of all those who have voiced no concern over the Magpies qualifying for the Champions League from fifth place but nevertheless find it absurdly baffling that Spurs are in there for winning the Europa League, a tournament for which they qualified by finishing…fifth.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nPre-season target: Keep all the points, don’t get relegated ✅\nMid-season target: Champions Actual League ❌",
      "Swiftly became clear that the pre-season target was going to be swatted aside with indecent ease so a tough mid-season target was added. This was the biggest upgrade to targets for anyone, obviously, and despite their late collapse it was one that was still achievable deep into the final day of the season.",
      "A fairer target would probably have been simply ‘European football’ and as with any English team that misses out on the Champions League but finds itself in one of the lesser comps, it is still worth pointing out the obvious silver-lining that comes with that.",
      "",
      "Southampton\nPre-season target: Don’t go full Burnley ❌\nMid-season target: Don’t go full Derby ✅",
      "Went too Burnley in the first half of the season, meaning Russell Martin tragically had to be sacked before he could catch the eye of Bayern Munich. It’s a cruel game.",
      "Ivan Juric came and inevitably went having done away with much of the more wilfully stupid aiming of weaponry directly at their own feet that Southampton had been deploying in those early months, but with no discernible improvement to results.",
      "It was left to Simon Rusk in his second caretaker spell of the season to scrape together the last couple of points needed to sneak past Derby and win in the most minor way possible.",
      "",
      "Tottenham\nPre-season target: Win a bloody trophy, any trophy ✅\nMid-season target: Win a bloody trophy, any trophy (but also maybe don’t Spurs your way into the Championship in the process, yeah?) ✅",
      "He bloody did it. The crazy Australian bastard only went and did it, mate. Having done exactly what he told us all he would do at the start of the season, Ange Postecoglou crafted one of the greatest narrative arcs in Barclays history and only the dreariest, most soulless of creatures, only someone entirely devoid of human emotion, would now want to cut this short without finding out whether season three actually can be better.",
      "Daniel Levy is apparently that man. He is, to paraphrase Stewart Lee, a man so lacking in imagination that if locked in a room containing nothing but a tea cosy would not even have the curiosity to discover whether it could make a serviceable hat.",
      "To be absolutely clear, we remain entirely convinced that this wildly unrepeatable high-wire act almost certainly represents the high-water mark of Postecoglou’s Tottenham career and that his chance of building an actual legacy is close to zero.",
      "We find his ‘season three’ claim far less compelling than his iconic ‘I always win things in my second season’ shout and we’re pretty sure so does he, even though the numbers offer pretty decent support.",
      "But at the same time he has absolutely earned the right to fail on his own terms now and the fact Levy seems so determined to let all the air out of the balloon so soon after Spurs fans got the one thing they have craved above all else for at least a decade is just maddeningly yet entirely Spurs.",
      "They really shouldn’t be allowed to have nice things. The universe was right all these years and Ange was wrong to meddle with forces he could not possibly understand.",

      "Four wins from the last 17 games of the season when there were no mitigating factors of competing priorities was a miserable effort, especially when the last three of those wins were against Leicester, Man United and West Ham. Winning at Arsenal, again, was admittedly a good bit.",
      "There were arguably some encouraging signs in the final weeks of the season, but eight points from the final six games isn’t that great really, and when all those points come from games against Southampton, Tottenham, Man United and Ipswich it becomes an even flimsier looking foundation for significant growth.",

      "Nineteen points from the last 10 games of the season is undoubtedly a good finish, and if anything it’s only made even better by the fact they still managed to Wolves their way to a momentum-sapping one point from the final four games of the season.",

      "That would have boosted their transfer budget ahead of the summer but now they could be forced to sell a number of players to give Amorim the players he needs to implement his style of play.",

      "Despite this, Man Utd could sell Fernandes in the coming days as he is being pursued by Al-Hilal as they look the finalise their squad for this month’s Club World Cup.",
      "Man Utd’s dire performances in the Premier League and loss in the Europa League final leave them with a limited summer budget and they likely need to sell to buy.",
      "So, while it would be incredibly difficult for Man Utd to replace Fernandes, his sale for £80-100m would significantly ease their financial troubles and enable Ruben Amorim to sign more upgrades suited to his 3-4-3 system.",

      "Fernandes has largely remained coy when asked about his future, but recent reports have indicated that he is open to a move to the Middle East outfit.",
      "It’s been said that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘risks a fallout’ with ‘seething’ Amorim if Fernandes is sold, while another recent report claimed he is ‘very close’ to an exit.",
      "Now, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a clear update, claiming Al-Hilal chiefs believe they are “close to an agreement” with Fernandes following “positive” discussions with his representatives.",
      "Jacobs also claims that one ‘key factor’ will be behind his final decision, and a deadline has been set.",
      "Jacobs tweeted: “Al-Hilal now believe an agreement with Bruno Fernandes is close after a week of positive meetings.",
      "“Fernandes is currently deliberating with his family. A key factor in whether Fernandes agrees will be if the move is also right for his family. It will be more than just a football decision. Hilal want a final answer by Friday.",
      "“No formal approach or bid yet to Manchester United, but Hilal’s belief is a sale will be sanctioned if Fernandes asks to leave. #MUFC still insist they don’t want to sell their captain”",
      "Reporter Graeme Bailey has already revealed that Al-Hilal are “pushing the boat out” for Fernandes, with £100m “a lot to turn down”.",
      "“Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest,” Bailey said.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has explained why he thinks Matheus Cunha’s arrival will lead to two stars leaving this summer.",
      "On Sunday, Man Utd announced the signing of Cunha in the most expensive transfer of this summer’s transfer window *so far*.",
      "The Red Devils made the versatile attacker their No.1 target and activated his £62.5m release clause after he contributed 17 goals and six assists for Wolves in all competitions during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "This is a key signing for Man Utd as they have been toothless in attack under Ruben Amorim and Cunha fits perfectly into the head coach’s 3-4-3 system.",
      "Ferdinand has given a few reasons why he thinks Cunha will be a great signing for Man Utd.",
      "“He needs to reboot this attack. We don’t look like we’re going to score goals in open play unless it’s Bruno [Fernandes] or maybe Amad [Diallo],” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Six reasons Man Utd should replace Ruben Amorim with Arsene Wenger…",
      "“We’ve taken Wolves’ top goalscorer this season. He’s got 16 goals to his name in all competitions.",
      "“He’s one of the players that I mentioned a few weeks ago: if I had a shopping list, he would be on there.",
      "“He knows the Premier League so he doesn’t need any adaptation time.",
      "“This is a huge factor… if you’re going to buy players from foreign leagues, players that don’t have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk.",
      "“But he has the experience here, we’ve seen him here, he grew up a Manchester United fan.”",
      "There is a drawback to this deal, though. This is because Ferdinand believes Cunha’s arrival will force Man Utd to offload Marcus Rashford and one more player this summer.",
      "“I’m hearing he’s taking the No.10 shirt which was Rashford’s shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford, man?” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“There’s a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well and it might answer a few questions. But 17 goals and six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team is impressive.",
      "“The recruitment team, the coaches and the players will have seen what he did to Manchester United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Manchester United like a hot knife through butter.",
      "“He looked like he had the power and I think he fits a Ruben Amorim player profile perfectly. He’s quick, he’s dynamic, he’s aggressive, he’s capable of dropping deep and transitioning with the ball, he can pass and he can threaten the opponents with a goal by running deep or coming short.",
      "“I think he’s the type of player that Ruben Amorim has been crying out for and with neither [Rasmus] Hojlund or [Joshua] Zirkzee at the moment looking like the answer in advanced positions, I think he has a real opportunity to play across one of those three positions quite easily, as a nine, as one of the guys off the sides.”",
      "He added: “The only thing I would say in this window is that £60m in this window, it will remain to be seen what type of work gets done when you’re spending a big chunk like that.",
      "“As much as I’m happy with it, it means they are going to be some going out of the door and it means there’s going to be somebody like Garnacho or Kobbie Mainoo… and Marcus Rashford.",
      "“They will be the players that will be going I think, so when you look at it it’s a lot of money. But where are you going to get players that can come and affect your first-team for that type of money?”",
      "Premier League side Man Utd have been ‘offered’ a Barcelona player in exchange for Marcus Rashford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rio Ferdinand was “hurt” to see long-term Man Utd target Jeremie Frimpong sign for arch-rivals Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Man Utd duo Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount need to leave Old Trafford this summer to rescue their careers, according to ex-Red Devils defender Paul Parker."

      "Manchester United have reportedly been ‘informed’ of the potential to sign a former Chelsea striker, among a number of other Premier League clubs.",
      "United have not had the best time of it with striker signings in the past couple of years. They signed Rasmus Hojlund for £72million two years ago, and Joshua Zirkzee joined in a £36.5million deal last summer.",
      "Both men played more than 30 Premier League games in the season just gone, but neither passed five goals.",
      "As a result, there’s speculation regarding both being sold, with United to sign a better striker. They have some big names on their radar, but might struggle to convince any great players to join given their lack of any European football next term.",
      "They have been offered a solution, though, as TBRFootball reports United are among the clubs who have been ‘approached’ by the representatives of Tammy Abraham, and ‘informed’ on his willingness to return to the Premier League.",
      "Abraham played 89 times in the English top flight, largely with Chelsea, and scored 26 goals and assisted seven more.",
      "He moved to Roma in 2021, and went on loan to AC Milan this season, racking up 47 goals and 20 assists since heading to Italy.",
      "At Milan this season, Abraham was directly involved in 17 goals, but wants to come back to England, and several Premier League sides are informed on his situation.",
      "TBRFootball’s report states West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have all taken an interest in him, while Aston Villa and Leeds are both keeping tabs on the striker’s situation.",
      "Villa know about Abraham’s qualities, having had him on loan when they were in the Championship in 2018-19. That was their last season in the second tier, with the striker helping them back to the top flight with 25 regular season goals and three assists, as well as a goal in the playoffs, which Villa won.",
      "Though that was now seven seasons ago, it has been suggested a few times in recent seasons that Villa might like to bring Abraham back to the club if possible.",
      "It looks unlikely that Marcus Rashford will be signed permanently, given he and Barcelona want to join forces, so Villa might well be keen on signing a new striker."

      "Al Hilal are willing to almost treble Fernandes' £250,000-a-week wages.",
      "The Portugal international, who will turn 31 in September, signed a contract extension last summer until 2027 with the option of a further 12 months.",

      "Al Hilal expect to have at least one big-name signing and a new head coach when they play in the Club World Cup in the United States in June.",
      "When asked if Fernandes had played his last game for United in their 3-1 friendly win over Hong Kong, Amorim replied: \"I do not think so. I do not know for sure, nobody knows, but I do not think so.",
      "\"I think he wants to stay, he is saying 'no' to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win. He is really good and needs to be in the best league in the world.",
      "\"Yes [we can turn down a £100m bid], we can find another way to earn money.",
      "\"Of course I am the manager, the coach, but sometimes it is the decision of the player, but of course I talk with him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",

      "It's understood they are getting encouragement that Mbeumo wants to come to Old Trafford.",
      "No talks have taken place between the clubs but formal discussions are now expected to proceed. United will face competition, with a number of Premier League clubs keen on the player.",
      "Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "United are looking to act quickly in the market to give Amorim as much time with his players ahead of the new season.",
      "Mbeumo is about to enter the final year of his Brentford contract, though the club have the option to extend by a further year.",
      "Brentford will listen to offers for Mbeumo, and Yoane Wissa, but they are not under any pressure to sell any of their players.",
      "There is a feeling within the club that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 14:22, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",

      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",

      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Bruno Fernandes is yet to make a decision on his future with Al Hilal willing to pay Man Utd £100m for their captain and nearly treble his wages; the potential sale poses a dilemma with the club in need of a cash injection to fund their rebuild but also so reliant on Fernandes",
      "Sunday 1 June 2025 19:13, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has often been relied upon as Manchester United's saviour - so it is fitting his parting gift could end up being one last rescue act.",
      "United always knew sales would be required this summer to create enough financial flexibility to reshape the squad for Ruben Amorim. Selling Fernandes was not part of that plan, the captain's future a widely presumed certainty until Al Hilal came to the table.",
      "Despite the Saudis' willingness to pay £100m for a player turning 31 in September, United and Amorim want to keep Fernandes. The United boss believes the midfielder wants to stay, though he could not guarantee he would. But can the club afford to turn this down?",
      "Such an offer is unlikely to come again given Fernandes' age. The windfall would be transformative for United ahead of a summer when the budget is pinched, and an overhaul is so dearly required. Fernandes' sale could kick-start a new chapter for the club.",
      "This rationale only holds up under the assumption that the funds would be spent wisely and, for a club with such a poor record in recruitment, it would be a huge gamble. No wonder there is scepticism. Go backwards again and relegation looms.",
      "Old Trafford has become a graveyard for stars over the last decade - Fernandes one of the few shining exceptions - and although INEOS are not to blame for that legacy, it highlights how tricky it would be to replace the club's best signing since Robin van Persie.",
      "We all know Fernandes is a production machine, but he has also become a leader. Imperfect, certainly. United's captain tends to try too hard when things go wrong - to his and the team's detriment. But where would they be without him?",
      "Well, United have not won a Premier League match without Fernandes since March 2022. The sample size is small, yet the record is telling. Six matches, five defeats and one draw. In a squad lacking in character and quality, Fernandes brings both in abundance.",
      "Fernandes' departure would rid United of their one elite player and surely make Old Trafford an even less attractive destination. Liam Delap has already chosen Chelsea over United. Finding adequate replacements is hard enough without Champions League.",
      "Emotionally, in a summer when academy graduates Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho appear set for the chop, on the back of hundreds of redundancies and the worst season for decades, the loss of Fernandes could bring the fanbase to its knees.",
      "In the context of the past year - and the past decade - when the club has been accused of losing touch with its identity, losing Fernandes would make United nearly unrecognisable heading into a summer that could become make or break for INEOS.",
      "If this were another club, it would be easier to predict how they might handle a similar scenario without such a glum outlook. The Philippe Coutinho comparison - although flawed - is an example of how a well-run club can sell a star to improve the collective.",
      "Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker were signed by Liverpool using the £146m fee paid by Barcelona. Their additions proved transformational for Jurgen Klopp, who would win the Champions League and Premier League in the next three years.",
      "Liverpool were further along in their rebuild, but the example offers a blueprint for how United could enjoy a similar transformation if Fernandes leaves. With a goalkeeper, central midfielder and striker dearly needed, £100m could fund a new spine for the team.",
      "Matheus Cunha, undeterred by the lack of European football, is already through the door. If others share his faith in the project remains to be seen, though the signing, sealed on day one of the window, suggests INEOS might be starting to figure things out.",
      "They will hope that is true after spending £200m in their first summer and taking the club from eighth in the table to 15th. Erik ten Hag was still in charge then though and the window had his fingerprints all over it with two more former Ajax players recruited.",
      "Now INEOS have another year under their belt and Amorim in place with a system that he has made clear will not change, the conditions certainly appear more conducive to a better window and the early signs are good.",
      "Cunha, 26, is one of a handful of Premier League-proven players United have signed while in their prime in the post Sir Alex Ferguson era - and if this is a sign of things to come, then INEOS are at least working to right the wrongs of the past.",
      "But funding moves for such players does not come cheap and could be difficult if Fernandes is not sold. Cunha, for instance, was £62.5m. Reports suggest that is more than half of the budget gone without any sales.",
      "If Fernandes stayed, risks would have to be taken on unknown quantities that suit Amorim's system, or he would have to put up with the current crop for longer. For a coach that could quickly come under pressure next season, neither sounds too appealing.",
      "But nor does losing Fernandes, and therein lies the dilemma. United want him to stay, so too does Amorim. The final decision, it seems, lies with Fernandes, who no one could blame for leaving after all he has put up with.",
      "United cannot afford to sell their captain but nor can they afford to turn down Al Hilal's offer."
