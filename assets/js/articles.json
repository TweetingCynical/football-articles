      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is unlikely to participate in Tuesday night's Premier League match against Wolves at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad faced the rock-bottom Midlands outfit just a few weeks ago, at Molineux, where they emerged as comfortable 4-1 victors. During that game, Fernandes netted two goals, while Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount also scored for the Red Devils.",
      "United's captain and main playmaker has been out of action since before Christmas, having limped off at half-time in the narrow loss to Aston Villa. Consequently, he was absent from the Boxing Day victory over Newcastle United, and it seems the Wolves match has also come too soon for him.",
      "It will undoubtedly be a harsh blow for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers across the country, who would have hoped for his earlier return. Fernandes, valued at £9.2m, shares the highest points tally for a midfielder with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Regrettably not. Although the midfielder is striving for a quick comeback, it's anticipated he'll be out until early-January.",
      "Speaking during his pre-Wolves press conference, Amorim confirmed he doesn't expect to have his skipper available for selection. \"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know,\" the Portuguese manager said this week.",
      "\"No chance he's going to play against Wolves. No chance.\"",
      "Amorim was also keen to highlight Fernandes' leadership qualities and the significance of his presence in the changing room. His absence for the forthcoming matches represents a substantial setback as a consequence.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there,\" the United manager continued. \"I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader.",
      "\"He can't be that guy that when he's not playing, he's not talking and speaking. He's always speaking.",
      "\"That's why he's the captain. He has bad things sometimes, the way he moves his arms [gestures on-field], but he's got a lot of good things, too.",
      "\"So there are a lot of things that you don't see, but that he does. He's a great leader all the time.\"",
      "The fixtures are arriving thick and fast throughout the Christmas period and, in turn, there are two match rounds this week, so make certain to set reminders for the FPL deadlines.",
      "For Game Week 19, FPL managers have until 6pm GMT this evening (Tuesday, December 30) to make any alterations to their squads. That's roughly two hours before United kick-off against Wolves at Old Trafford.",
      "For Game Week 20 this weekend, users have until 11am GMT on Saturday, January 3.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The January transfer window is just around the corner and it could shape the Premier League title race and relegation battle. Whether strengthening the squad for the title run-in or panic-buying to try and avoid the drop, the mid-season window offers ample opportunities.",
      "This year, the January transfer window runs from January 1 until 7pm on February 2, allowing plenty of time to do business. Some deals have already been in the pipeline for some time, while others will emerge late on deadline day.",
      "There is precedent for big-spending after Premier League sides splashed a combined £370million in January 2025, with Manchester City accounting for over half of that by buying Omar Marmoush, Vitor Reis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Nico Gonzalez for £190m. That didn’t come close to January 2023, though, when a record £815m was spent.",
      "This one is pretty much nailed on. Bournemouth are ready to sell, with Semenyo’s £65m release clause now common knowledge, and the Ghana international has made it plain that he wants to join City following a run of strong form.",
      "Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea were all credited with interest in Semenyo, but have backed off after City made progress in talks. Those negotiations have gone well and the 25-year-old is expected to join the Premier League title-chasers in the early weeks of January after netting eight goals in 16 league games.",
      "This deal had appeared to be nailed on in the summer. Guehi underwent a medical to complete a £35m move from Crystal Palace to Liverpool before Palace chairman Steve Parish pulled the plug at the last minute. But the Palace captain is out of contract in June and the club have made peace with his impending departure.",
      "The only questions that remain are where and when. Arne Slot has previously stated that Liverpool wouldn’t return for Guehi in January, but an ACL injury to Giovanni Leoni, the shaky form of Ibrahima Konate – who is also approaching the end of his contract – and competition from Real Madrid and Bayern Munich could force their hand. The England defender is keen on moving to Merseyside, although Palace do want to keep him until the end of the season.",
      "Zirkzee has struggled since joining Manchester United from Bologna in the summer of 2024 for £36.5m and now he could be leaving. Roma sporting director Ricky Massara was in London for talks earlier in December and United are open to selling, but only under the right terms, given Ruben Amorim’s thread-bare squad.",
      "United will sell for a fee of around €35-40m (£30-35m), given the 24-year-old is under contract until June 2029. However, Roma want a loan deal worth an initial €5m-6m (£4.3-5.2m) with an obligation to buy if they qualify for the Champions League. One to keep an eye on.",
      "Johnson scored 18 goals in all competitions for Spurs last season, including the winner in the Europa League final, but has been scarcely used by Thomas Frank and a move is imminent. The Athletic says that a £35m deal has been agreed between the two parties and Palace now just need to sort out personal terms.",
      "Johnson joined Spurs from Nottingham Forest in September 2023 for £47.5m, but is now moving onto pastures new.",
      "Mohammed Kudus has basically taken Johnson’s place in the Spurs line-up, but the winger’s exit could mean an arrival in north London. Tottenham had a £60m bid rejected by Man City for Savinho in the summer, but they may be more keen to sell now Semenyo is arriving to further increase competition for places in Pep Guardiola ’s side.",
      "Savinho has been stuck on the bench at City this season and may jump at the chance of more regular game time. Equally, his record of five goals and 16 assists in 70 appearances could tempt City to sell.",
      "Mainoo has made his frustration plain this season, having been stuck on the bench under Amorim’s management. The injury to Bruno Fernandes then came just as Mainoo himself picked up a knock, adding to the frustration, and he wants out.",
      "Napoli have benefited massively from signing Scott McTominay from United and want a repeat with Mainoo. Amorim has maintained that Mainoo is not for sale and is a part of the club’s future, so it remains to be seen whether United would change that stance – especially given their injuries and AFCON absentees right now.",
      "Everton are not getting much out of Beto and Thierno Barry (a combined three goals in 40 appearances this season, to be precise), so are keen on a new striker. Ivan Toney is eager to seal a place in the England squad for the summer and could return from making a fortune in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Toney has 43 goals and 10 assists in 63 games for Al-Ahli and would undoubtedly be a good signing. The problem is that Al-Ahli don’t want to sell and that Toney would face a huge tax bill upon returning to the UK.",
      "The Hammers need reinforcements and fast as they sink towards the Championship. Nuno Espirito Santo will be backed in the transfer window and the ex- Wolves manager is turning to a familiar face. Traore is a favourite from their time together at Wolves and Fulham are happy to sell the beefy winger, who isn’t playing much under Marco Silva.",
      "Chelsea would like to find new homes for Disasi and Raheem Sterling, who were in the dreaded ‘bomb squad’ over the summer. Disasi has since been included in the first team by Enzo Maresca, but is still well down the pecking order.",
      "Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham all showed an interest in Disasi in the summer, but Palace seems more likely, given they need to plan for life without Guehi.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that criticism of Benjamin Sesko is wide of the mark and believes a lot of his contributions are hugely effective - even if he's not scoring regularly.",
      "The Slovenian made the move to Manchester United from RB Leipzig for £70million in the summer, but has scored just twice. His slow start has seen him come in for criticism but Ferdinand sees similarities between Sesko and his former team-mate, Louis Saha. The French forward was signed by Alex Ferguson and played in trophy-winning sides alongside Ferdinand. The defender concedes he was never going to be top scorer at Old Trafford, but made numerous impacts during a game that had huge value.",
      "Ferdinand sees similarities with Sesko, who has led an attacking line that also features Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha. Whilst he accepts that goals will be the ultimate marker, he also cites the moments that prove invaluable.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: \"Sesko [offers more] than [just] goals. Yes, the strikers will be judged on their goals, but internally sometimes there are things that they bring to the table that you go, ‘You know what, that is huge’. You know who was like that? Louis Saha. He was never going to win the Golden Boot at Manchester United.",
      "\"But in terms of his value to the team, he was a joke some of the stuff that he would do to enable others to play better. He would get us up the pitch at times, he would hold the ball for three or four seconds at times to give us a breather. Forget goals with him. His all-round game… I was sitting there sometimes going, ‘Oh my God, I’m so happy he’s on our team’.",
      "\"I think with Sesko, listen, we still want to see the goals. But I’ve seen a few parts of his game that I go, ‘Oh the other players are liking that’. I can see it. Manchester United haven’t had a striker who can just hold it up or flick it on for ages. Like just a simple little thing but effective.\"",
      "The 22-year-old has just returned from injury and made his first start since November when he played in the loss at Aston Villa. Sesko had little impact on the game at Villa Park, coming off in the 73rd minute having had just one shot and 16 touches.",
      "Amorim though is adamant that his summer signing will improve. He said: \"He is returning to competition really fast. He is going to improve a lot. The idea was 70 to 75 minutes. He stopped for a while and we are trying to help the players.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The winger has come through the ranks at the Etihad and had a big reputation, but his progress was stalled by a serious injury. He's since fallen down the pecking order and a move away is on the cards with the Bundesliga a likely destination.",
      "Bobb has a number of potential suitors with Dortmund keen on his signing. The Daily Mail reports they are in negotiations over a loan move until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent deal at around £30m.",

      "Milan are holding out for a fee of around £35m for the former Chelsea attacker, but Fenerbahce want to negotiate that price down.",

United ultimately spent £62.5million to land the Brazilian forward.

      "BY RYAN TAYLOR",
      "West Ham have made an approach for FC Viktoria Plzen striker Rafiu Durosinmi.The Nigerian, who was wanted by Wolves in 2023 and later failed a medical at Eintracht Frankfurt, has scored 13 goals in all competitions so far this season.Reports in England claim the Hammers have bid £12million for the 22-year-old but the offer received by Plzen is worth far less as Durosinmi is out of contract at the end of the season and it's currently not enough to strike a deal.Durosinmi is also being tracked by Benfica, Lazio and Stuttgart ahead of the upcoming January transfer window.Two years ago, the physical frontman suffered ACL tears in both knees and missed 14 months of action before marking his return with a brace and an assist against Sparta Prague.Nuno Espirito Santo is targeting extra firepower in attack at the London Stadium in a bid to save the club's season after Niclas Fullkrug was loaned to AC Milan.Fulham winger Adama Traore, who worked under Nuno at Wolves, is also a target and he could be available on the cheap as his contract at Craven Cottage expires in the summer.",

They could face competition from Turkish giants Fenerbahce for the left sided player who has gained a reputation for providing assists and an attacking threat.",
      "El Karouani, 25, was a surprise omission from Morocco’s AFCON squad but harbours hopes of making next summer’s World Cup. His price and performances this season mean there will be strong interest from European clubs in January.",

      "A Manchester United academy graduate who left Old Trafford over a lack of playing opportunities could make a shock return to his boyhood club this January transfer window as Ruben Amorim looks to overhaul his midfield. James Garner joined Carrington at under-8 level but made just seven first-team appearances before heading up the M62 in the summer of 2022 to join Everton in a £15m deal slammed by furious United fans.",
      "United boast a proud record of developing young talent and many supporters wanted then-boss Erik ten Hag to hand Garner a chance after an impressive loan spell at Nottingham Forest – only for United to offload him on the final day of the summer transfer window. But the Merseyside-born midfielder could finally be allowed to stake his place for a starting slot at Old Trafford as he enters the final six months of his contract with the Toffees.",
      "According to the Mail, the Red Devils are targeting the 24-year-old in a cut-price deal that would bolster boss Amorim’s depleted midfield options.",
      "Questions mark hang over the long-term futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte while injuries to Mainoo and skipper Fernandes have left United short in the middle of the park. The crisis forced Amorim to use 18-year-old academy prospect Jack Fletcher for 45 minutes against Newcastle United on Boxing Day and even push centre-back Lisandro Martinez into midfield away at Aston Villa.",
      "Everton are currently in contract negotiations with Garner and have the option to trigger a 12-month extension but United remain hopeful that they could lure the box-to-box midfielder back to his former home. Garner has made 103 appearances for the Toffees since joining four years ago and has previously said he has no regrets at leaving one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "“When I came back to United, I felt like I had a good enough season to have a shot,” Garner told BBC Sport. “But unfortunately, I got injured on the first day and it set me back two or three weeks, so the manager did not get to see me in training and games.",
      "“It was a decision where – after having two seasons in men’s football – I wanted to be part of a team and squad, ideally starting too. I knew I wasn’t going to get that at United so I made the decision to move here.",
      "“I could have gone on loan again and come back but I felt I would have been in the exact same position I was then. I didn’t want to be stuck in the mud, I needed to make a decision to leave one of the best clubs in the world, which was hard, but it is one I am happy I made.”",
      "If United can’t convince Garner to return, other options include Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson – although these moves are unlikely to take place in the winter window.",

He's in the different club, different pressure, but I think he copes with that really well. He was struggling because he was not scoring and because of social media views, he was thinking too much about the numbers, but the influence that he has in the team is so important for us.\"",
      "Cunha's quality had been evident throughout last season, where he scored 17 times. Prior to Wolves facing Liverpool, Arne Slot claimed the forward could play for any top-six team. He would go on to score an impressive goal in Wolves' loss at Anfield.",
      "Cunha has already come up with big moments in Manchester and helped form a forward line that gives the team far more bite than they had last season - with Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko also among their options.",

      "He said when he signed: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.\"",

      "Manchester United face a crucial month as the January transfer window approaches. Ruben Amorim’s side have improved over recent months as the club seek a return to Champions League football.",
      "The Red Devils will hope to boost their top four hopes with a win over Wolves at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. The visiting side are still searching for their first victory of the campaign but United will be focused on closing the three-point gap to Liverpool in fourth.",
      "While there has been plenty of focus on potential incomings, United could raise their transfer funds through player sales. Here is a detailed look at some of the biggest headlines surrounding the club.",
      "Marcus Rashford has relished his time at Barcelona in his second loan spell away from Manchester United. The forward has notched 18 goal contributions in 24 games for Hansi Flick's side.",
      "The Catalan giants hold an option to make Rashford's move permanent for £26million. While that would represent value for money given Rashford's current form, the England international may have to compromise to get a deal over the line.",
      "Spanish outlet Sport reports that Rashford is willing to discuss a reduction in wages to fit within the club's salary cap, with Barcelona's financial issues well-documented. It is claimed that Flick wants to keep Rashford beyond this season.",
      "Meanwhile, Rashford has also made it clear that he wishes to stay. The Spanish club are said to be confident that the 28-year-old would reject advances from any other sides to remain part of Flick's team.",
      "His United deal is set to run until 2028. However, Rashford was loaned out to Aston Villa last January before being allowed to join Barcelona in the summer.",
      "Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund has been impressing Napoli boss Antonio Conte. After a difficult two seasons at Old Trafford, the young striker joined the Italian champions, who could pay up to £44m to sign him permanently.",
      "The 22-year-old endured difficult spells in a United shirt, not helped by his hefty £72m price tag, which increased expectations. However, Hojlund has received plaudits from Conte after scoring a brace as Napoli defeated Cremonese on Sunday.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,\" Conte said \"Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "Conte added: \"He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Looking to close out another disappointing year on a positive note, Manchester United will aim for back-to-back victories as they host Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. After narrowly defeating Newcastle United on Boxing Day, United hope to end 2025 with another three points against the Premier League’s bottom side.",
      "Despite being without several key players, including inspirational captain Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United strengthened their push for European qualification last time out, with Patrick Dorgu’s spectacular volley sealing a win over Newcastle. Ruben Amorim’s side adopted an unfamiliar four-man defense, conceding much of the possession and riding their luck at times, but ultimately held on for a hard-fought 1-0 victory. Even with a makeshift backline—featuring a teenager and a player who has missed most of 2025 through injury—United managed just their second Premier League clean sheet of the season.",
      "After winning only four of his first 14 top-flight home games, Amorim has started to turn things around at Old Trafford, with five wins from the last eight matches lifting the mood among United supporters. Fans will expect that momentum to continue, as United have won eight of their last 11 encounters with Wolves, including a 4-1 triumph at Molineux earlier this month. However, having lost their final league match in each of the past two years, United will be wary of another slip-up against opponents who seem destined for relegation.",
      "Wolves, meanwhile, have managed to win their final fixture in just one of the last six calendar years but did manage a surprise 1-0 victory on their last visit to Old Trafford in April. That result was a rare bright spot in an otherwise difficult year: the Midlands club have lost 25 Premier League matches and could match the unwanted record of 26 set by Ipswich Town in 1994.",
      "Winless in 18 league games this season, Wolves are firmly rooted to the bottom of the table with just two points and have endured 11 consecutive defeats following Saturday’s 2-1 loss to Liverpool. Now 16 points adrift of safety, Rob Edwards’ side are already preparing for life in the Championship, with pride the only thing left to play for. Avoiding Derby County’s record for the fewest points in a Premier League season (11 in 2007-08) will surely serve as motivation for Edwards as he looks to halt the club’s downward spiral.",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "The transfer window hasn’t even opened yet and we already know that Antoine Semenyo’s future promises to be THE big story in January.",
      "The Bournemouth star opted to stay on the south coast after interest in the summer, signing a new contract to start the season. But that always appeared a temporary solution, particularly after details of a £65million release clause in his deal became public.",
      "With nine goals in 17 Bournemouth appearances, the Ghanaian is hot property and almost certain to be on the move at the start of 2026.",
      "The forward is said to want a deal completed at the start of the month. With Manchester City leading the race and also wanting a move wrapped up quickly. But there is also interest from the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "First things first, Semenyo and Bournemouth need to strike while the iron is relatively hot. Sure, Semenyo has scored in his last three Premier League games but none of those goals was in a winning cause and this run had been preceded by seven blanks.",
      "Semenyo has also gone ten Premier League matches without an assist. The £65million release clause will be met in this January transfer window but if the Ghanaian stays at Bournemouth, there is no guarantee that figure would be seen as value in the summer.",
      "So, a January move makes sense all round. It is nice for the 26-year-old - whose career numbers are good but not startling - to have so many blue-chip suitors and there is an obvious attraction in a move to Manchester City.",
      "But Semenyo’s best bet could well be Manchester United, if their interest is deadly serious. At City, Semenyo will have to take his chances with the vagaries of the Pep Guardiola selection process. That does not always work out well - ask Jack Grealish.",
      "And unless Mohamed Salah does leave, Semenyo will also face a tough fight for a starting place at Liverpool. There is also competition at Old Trafford, for sure, but it now feels like an exciting project and one that Semenyo could be front and centre of, rather than just another option.",
      "Semenyo has a big decision to make. But one thing we do know is that he has to leave Bournemouth. Semenyo deserves to be showcasing his skills on the biggest stages. Which rules out a move to Manchester United - a club which has ruined talents like him in recent years.",
      "Moving to Liverpool to be Mo Salah's heir apparent would be a thankless task, given what the Egyptian king has achieved. While Liverpool are going through a period of huge uncertainty when it comes to Arne Slot.",
      "Which leaves Manchester City as Semenyo's best destination. He would have to work hard to earn regular starts under Guardiola and there would be no guarantees.",
      "But he would be learning from the best manager in the business when it comes to developing his skills. Not to mention winning trophies.",
      "Semenyo's decision to stay at Bournemouth in the summer looks a masterstroke, especially when you consider some of the struggles of his former team-mates. Milos Kerkez at Liverpool a case in point.",
      "His release clause makes him very attainable, but if he could strike a deal to remain with the Cherries and move for the same fee in the summer I would stay where I was. Mid-season moves are always a risk. You have no pre-season to get up to speed with their patterns for one.",
      "And waiting a few months allows Semenyo to see how the land lies at the various clubs. If Salah really is destined to move on, then maybe a move to Liverpool becomes more attractive. Manchester City are an obvious option, but he'd have to accept not playing every minute. So if I were him, I'd stick rather than twist right now.",
      "Semenyo should go to Manchester City and be an absolute superstar. There is nothing like being wanted, pursued and championed - especially when Guardiola is the manager who wants you.",
      "What an opportunity for one of the Premier League’s best wingers. He can operate with both feet, on both wings, is a big personality, leader and scorer of big goals.",
      "This guy has got the lot. He has been phenomenal for Bournemouth and I was amazed that clubs did not push harder for him last summer. But the reason he should choose City over Liverpool, Manchester United and the rest is that feeling of being wanted. That sense that he will be given an incredible platform to shine by the best manager in the Premier League with a team on the rise again.",
      "Yes, there will be competition for places. But City have moved for him despite having the depth of players like Jeremy Doku and Savinho. But he is a step up in my view on Savinho. It is interesting that Semenyo renegotiated his contract and Bournemouth knew inserting a clause would make them vulnerable.",
      "The uncertainty has undoubtedly impacted on Bournemouth - but that underlines the player’s quality.",
      "Bournemouth and Semenyo have been preparing for a January exit since the Cherries star signed his new contract, so the time is now for a move. But transfers during the season are not always well-suited to smart decisions.",
      "Semenyo has no shortage of suitors and plenty of uncertainty. Where Liverpool and Manchester United will finish the season is anyone’s guess, and for Semenyo to leave the south coast, trophies and European football will be preferred on the agenda.",
      "So, I can understand why Manchester City appears to be the player’s favoured choice. Playing time won’t be immediately guaranteed but a Premier League winners' medal could be won.",
      "Semenyo's versatility will offer multiple chances to come into Guardiola's thinking. And a move presents an opportunity to work with one of the most iconic coaches of his era.",
      "Some may point to Guardiola's future as a reason to look elsewhere, but it's hardly like Ruben Amorim and Arne Slot have always looked secure options in recent months.",
      "Do Manchester City really need Antoine Semenyo? Or are they buying the Ghana forward to stop their title rivals recruiting the best Premier League player in a club not playing in Europe this season?",
      "Guardiola has spent big in the last two windows and summer signing Rayan Cherkhi is now playing superbly as City have won eight in a row. The system and the players are working well.",
      "Liverpool might need a replacement for Mo Salah this January - though they would be better buying Marc Guehi six months before the end of his contract. Arsenal bought Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke in the summer to play out wide and cannot keep spending.",
      "City is a great move for Semenyo but there are historic warnings from clubs who bought big late in the season. Malcolm Allison paid a club record £200,000 for Rodney Marsh when City were four points clear at the top in March 1972 before finishing fourth.",
      "Aston Villa made a mistake buying Tony Cascarino in March 1990. And in February 1996, Newcastle bought Faustino Asprilla for £6.7m when Kevin Keegan’s side were nine points clear at the top of the table before finishing four points behind Manchester United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The United boss has insisted he will not immediately swap to a back three after switching shape for the first time as head coach in the Boxing Day win against Newcastle.",
      "Amorim showed flexibility in his methods for the first time in his 14 months in charge at Old Trafford. The Portuguese coach has claimed that United's new formation could stick around in the coming weeks.",
      "The Red Devils adjusted their shape with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo all absent through international duty, and Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes all on the injury list. But Amorim has suggested he had always planned to evolve during his time in the Red Devils' hotseat.",
      "The 40-year-old only avoided doing so earlier so that it would not give the impression he had caved to media pressure. Amorim has played the 3-4-2-1 shape, which he had success with at Sporting CP, almost exclusively at United, and felt it was important to use embed in his principles using that system.",
      "\"First of all, it's a process,\" said Amorim. \"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process. We are trying to build an identity.",
      "\"Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing. It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\"",
      "Amorim has been adamant that his principles of play will remain the same regardless of the shape of his side. But, having finally moved away from utilising wing-backs, a back four might be seen more often as his tenure enters its next phase.",
      "Such flexibility should offer opponents more headaches with Newcastle already being forced into off-the-cuff changes at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said.",
      "\"But that was something that I was talking about. But when you talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I'm changing because of you [the media], and, I think, that is the end for the manager.",

      "But Fernandes' competitive streak has already seen him asking his head coach if he can involve himself in training, but Amorim accepts there is no chance of him playing in the short-term.",
      "He said: \"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know. No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance. Kobbie Mainoo is going to start on the [training] pitch also, so we will see. Matthijs is struggling a little bit. Harry the same thing.\"",

      "\"He's always speaking, that's why he's the captain,\" the United head coach added. \"He has bad things sometimes, the way move his arms, but he has a lot of good things. The practice, every time he makes a recovery, he is the guy who is going to watch the other guys' training that day. So there is a lot of things that you guys don't see but that he does. He's a great leader all the time.",

      "When United face Wolves they won't just be without Fernandes. Mason Mount is facing a late fitness test, while centre backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out. Kobbie Mainoo won't be fit whilst Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

United secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Newcastle at Old Trafford on Box‎ing Day, recording just their second Premier League clean sheet of the campaign.",
      "However, the Portuguese head coach came under fire after making multiple defensive switches in the second half as his side barely withstood a fierce late assault from their opponents. The substitutions included Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw being withdrawn for the relatively untested Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia late on, a decision which sparked surprise.",
      "Ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster has now urged Amorim to avoid making such alterations going forward, suggesting his players won't have been pleased with the disruption.",

      "\"Fair play to him, he's obviously getting the results at the moment. But I was thinking, why? If you ask professional footballers about what they think of that, they will tell you honestly and say you shouldn't do that.",
      "\"You don't understand what it's like being a team in those last dying moments, with seven or eight minutes to go. You don't mess with it. Everybody knows where they are.",
      "\"They've played the game there and they're comfy there. They know what's working. You don't need to just swap them for a defensive-minded player.\"",
      "Foster wasn't the only ex-United star to question the peculiar substitutions. Red Devils icon Gary Neville also admitted he was bewildered by the team that ended the match.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sp‎orts, Neville said: \"I'd go as far as to say it's the most bizarre Manchester United XI I've ever seen on the pitch at the end of a game. But they're hanging in there. They're fighting for their lives and Newcastle are pushing them.",
      "\"I thought Manchester United edged the first half. I thought they did really well, but then the substitutions came. The shape, the players on the pitch got even more bizarre, but they hung on.\"",
      "Amorim has remained committed to deploying a 3-4-2-1 system since taking charge at United, but shifted to a back four against Newcastle. Despite facing flak for his late-game changes, which saw the defence morph into a back six, Amorim insisted he was satisfied with the determination displayed by his squad.",
      "He said: \"I think we suffered all together. You can say that we defended well because we didn't suffer the goal, but they had chances to score a goal. We needed a little bit of luck sometimes. We managed to defend, sometimes with a back six, but we suffered together and that is a good feeling.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay impressed during Napoli's 2-0 triumph over Cremonese on Sunday night. Hojlund is currently on loan in Italy from Manchester United whilst McTominay departed Old Trafford for good in 2024.",
      "The Scottish midfielder has flourished since his move to Naples, already securing both domestic cup and league honours. He was even crowned Serie A's Most Valuable Player last season.",
      "Hojlund joined McTominay at the club on a temporary deal this summer and appears to have settled in remarkably swiftly. The striker has netted nine goals across all competitions for his new team and on Sunday he needed just 13 minutes to break the deadlock. He doubled the advantage shortly before the interval, courtesy of a clever McTominay flick.",
      "Hojlund was described as \"unstoppable\" by La Gazzetta dello Sport, who particularly lauded the 22-year-old striker's finishing ability and his movement in the penalty area.",
      "\"Simply unmarkable,\" they wrote. \"He moved with the grace of a panther and the clinical nature of a veteran. His first goal was a masterclass in timing but the second showed he is a true predator in the box.\"",
      "McTominay delivered a stellar performance, playing a crucial role in the second goal. The Scottish midfielder was praised for his omnipresence on the field: \"McTominay was everywhere.",
      "\"His physical dominance in the middle allowed [Stanislav] Lobotka to create, while his late runs into the box are becoming Napoli's most dangerous tactical weapon.\"",
      "The Danish player is just one goal away from matching his total tally from last season at United. Corriere dello Sport highlighted his importance to Antonio Conte's Napoli side.",

      "McTominay also received an impressive 6.5/10. They wrote: \"Overwhelming physicality. He dismantled Cremonese's attempts to build from the back. Even when not on the scoresheet his presence dictates the rhythm of the game.\"",

      "\"McTominay won every duel and provided the verticality that Napoli lacked in previous seasons. He is the heart of this team's transition play.\"",

      "They reported: \"The Danish striker still managed to complete his brace, emerging from behind McTominay in a melee and slotting the ball into the net.",
      "\"This came just in time for Conte's team to enter the half-time break in the best possible shape, two goals up thanks to the excellent performances of the usual Lobotka, McTominay and the defensive unit.",
      "\"The finale was uneventful, with the Italian champions in complete control. From the Super Cup to the league this is their third straight victory, all 2-0.\"",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim returned to winning ways against Newcastle on Friday evening. The club are now just three points behind third-placed Liverpool.",
      "In a scrappy affair, it was Patrick Dorgu's sumptuous volley that proved the difference when Amorim's side hosted the Magpies. The win saw the Portuguese coach revert to a rarely-seen back four in the absence of captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Dutchman Zirkzee only touched down in Manchester in the summer of 2024 and was the first addition secured under new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Erik ten Hag was the manager upon his arrival from Bologna.",
      "The £36.5million forward failed to make any impact under Ten Hag and with Amorim in charge, he has been limited to appearances off the bench. He has mustered only a single assist so far this season.",
      "With new forwards purchased in the summer, Zirkzee's name began to be linked with a transfer away, though nothing materialised. With the January window soon open, those same rumours are persisting and new reports suggest he has made up his mind regarding his future.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Zirkzee has reportedly agreed to a move to Roma. The Italian side have long been mooted as potential suitors for the Dutchman.",
      "Zirkzee has now supposedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by boss Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system. The report states that a move is expected to be complete by mid-January.",
      "With the men's team seemingly braced for Zirkzee's exit, the women's team has been handed a boost. Japanese midfielder Hinata Miyazawa has signed a new contract with United that will keep her at the club until 2029.",
      "Miyazawa arrived in Manchester two years ago and helped the club lift the Women's FA Cup during the 2023/24 season. She is also a regular for her national side.",
      "Director of Women's Football at United Matt Johnson expressed: \"We are really excited to have Hinata extend her time at Manchester United.",
      "\"She has become a critical component to the way we play. Her footballing intelligence and technical ability enables her and the team to control and dictate play from central areas.\"",

      "John Terry is auctioning the kit he wore during his infamous penalty slip and miss in the 2008 Champions League Final against Manchester United. The former Chelsea captain is clearing out his wardrobe of some iconic pieces of memorabilia in order to raise money for charity.",
      "In addition to the strip from that notorious moment, a more difficult goodbye may come as he parts ways with the kit which he wore when lifting the 2011/12 Champions League trophy. Terry was in his full Blues kit despite being suspended for the penalty shootout win itself.",
      "While Chelsea fans may be queuing up for a Champions League-winning top, perhaps there will be some United fans in search of the grass stains left in Terry's 2008 shirt after his slip. After being called upon to take the decisive penalty following Cristiano Ronaldo's miss, Terry slipped as he hit the ball and struck the post in Moscow. The Red Devils went on to win in sudden death.",
      "The bidding will begin at $5,000 (£3,700) for that shirt. Others have a cheaper entry with the tops from the final game of his Chelsea career and his last career match listed at $1,000 (£740). They are among more than 20 items that the 45-year-old is putting up for auction with proceeds going to charity.",
      "The funds will be directed to the John Terry Foundation, which supports a range of charities nationwide. \"My foundation is going to benefit with two very close to my heart foundations that are in desperate need of the money,\" Terry said. \"It's going to a great cause, so all the support is going to be welcome.\"",
      "More high-ticket items will also be available. Terry is also set to let go of his first Premier League winners' medal.",
      "The Chelsea icon captained his team to a dominant title win under Jose Mourinho, ending the club's 50-year wait for the title. The medal could raise up to £75,000.",
      "Shirts that Terry has claimed in some of his biggest battles will also be available. Match-worn tops from Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will all go under the hammer.",
      "The sale will take place on Wednesday, December 31 via an online auction house, Goldin. A spokesperson said that the collection was a testament to Terry's truly 'remarkable' career.",
      "\"When considering the greatest defenders in the history of English football, John Terry's name can often be found at the forefront of the conversation,\" a statement read. \"A stalwart and imposing presence on Chelsea's vaunted back line, a position he held with the club for nearly 20 years, Terry quickly was anointed as the club's skipper under newly arrived manager Jose Mourinho, a decision that proved wise beyond measure.",
      "\"Among the lots is Terry's Premier League medal from his first win in 2004-05 and some of the shirts exchanged with opponents, including Lionel Messi",
      "\"In addition to his domestic achievements, Terry established himself as an accomplished lynchpin on the backline of England's National Team, appearing in 78 international competitions while representing the Three Lions and scoring six goals total.",
      "\"Goldin is proud to present a remarkable array of memorabilia sourced directly from John Terry's personal collection, testaments to various stages of Terry's illustrious and accomplished career.\"",

      "The 28-year-old has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under Hansi Flick. Such form has placed him in contention for an England call-up for the World Cup next summer Flick, according to reports in Spain, wants to retain Rashford's services, and the club are actively working towards a deal.",
      "Mundo Deportivo hosted a poll which revealed 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would be in favour of keeping Rashford at the club, by activating the purchase option in his loan. A total of 6.3 per cent reckon that sporting chief Deco should hold off until the end of their season.",
      "That leaves almost 40 per cent of fans in opposition to signing Rashford permanently.",
      "For his part, Rashford appears content at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy product has discussed his future ambitions with the club. He told SPORT in an interview: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",

      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",

      "He came on for Luke Shaw in the 88th minute and assisted Ruben Amorim's team in securing crucial three points, drawing them level with Chelsea in fifth place. The left-back had spent the latter part of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after failing to impress Amorim.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has, for the first time, been considering leaving Manchester United on a permanent basis, a new report claims. Mainoo, 20, has been left disgruntled by his lack of game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The midfielder's only start this season came in United's humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town in August. Mainoo pushed to leave his boyhood club on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window, but the Red Devils weren't willing to let him go.",
      "Amorim was set to turn to Mainoo for United's game at Aston Villa last Sunday before he suffered an injury in training. The calf problem also ruled him out of Friday's hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Newcastle.",
      "With just a few days until the January window opens, it's emerged that Mainoo is once again weighing up a departure - but this time not on loan. The i Paper report that sources close to the 10-time England international say that he's been exploring a permanent exit, with a number of clubs across Europe registering their interest.",
      "Napoli could be one of them. Former Old Trafford team-mates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have reignited their careers in Naples, and Mainoo has been tipped to be next.",
      "United, however, would only entertain a huge offer and are lacking depth in midfield. Bruno Fernandes is currently out injured and Casemiro has only played 90 minutes three times for United this season.",
      "Unless the Red Devils were able to sign one of their top midfield targets - Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton - selling Mainoo would leave Amorim with only Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte as backups to Fernandes and Casemiro. Ugarte has started United's last two games while Mount picked up an injury on Boxing Day.",

      "Amorim went on to say: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",

      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Given the lack of options available it would make sense to go with the same team again. The back four worked well and the return of Lisandro Martinez was huge, so I think you go with that shape and those same players.",
      "Manuel Ugarte had a good game on Boxing Day so deserves to keep his place and with Mainoo and Fernandes still out, Casemiro can go again. The concern is obviously around Mount. If fit, he plays. If he isn't, I'd be tempted to go with Jack Fletcher. He settled into the game against Newcastle and this should be much easier.",
      "Benjamin Sesko needs a goal but played well on Boxing Day. Patrick Dorgu has to play on the right-wing again and Matheus Cunha looks in good form.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "Even if Mount is in a position to start against Wolves, it would be tempting not to risk him. The former Chelsea man's history with injuries proves Ruben Amorim needs to tread carefully with the attacking midfielder and should not rush him back.",
      "As for who replaces him, that's a different conundrum entirely. While tempting to give Fletcher his first senior start, Joshua Zirkzee could be best to play the 4-2-3-1 system.",
      "Other than that, the same team that started against Newcastle makes sense. Dorgu was good in a more advanced role and Cunha is proving to be filling in for Bryan Mbeumo well.",

      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\" But perhaps more interesting was Amorim's comment on the back four.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said, and that could set alarm bells ringing for the players who have played well in his 3-4-3 system.",
      "Amad has been excellent since Amorim arrived. Having played as a No.10 in the 2024/25 season, Amorim pushed the forward to the right wing-back role and he has excelled.",
      "The Ivorian is the best wing-back option at Old Trafford, even with Patrick Dorgu's form starting to show signs of improvement. In his absence, it made sense to move to a back four. If Amorim sticks with a back four, it could be bad news for Amad.",
      "In a 4-2-3-1 system, Amad could not drop further back to play as a full-back. If you were to pick out one criticism in his game as a wing-back, it would be his struggles defensively. He is good enough in an attacking sense to warrant starting as a wing back, but a traditional full-back role is far more reserved.",
      "You would need to push Amad further forward if he were to start. But for a team currently stressing over their squad depth, the quality attacking options starts to become stacked.",
      "Amad would be fighting for a place in the three alongside Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha. One will have to drop to the bench and there's a chance it could be Amad.",
      "There is no reason to panic for Amad and considering he is in brilliant form at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) there's every chance he regains his place upon his return to England. But if Amorim sticks with the 4-2-3-1 formation, Amad might not be the automatic starter he has been so far under Amorim.",

      "Manchester United will be without captain Bruno Fernandes for their Premier League clash with Wolves on Tuesday, despite the midfielder asking to return to training just a week after picking up a hamstring injury. Ruben Amorim is also sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount after he limped out of the Boxing Day win against Newcastle United.",
      "United felt they couldn't risk Mount after he complained of feeling tightness against the Magpies, with Amorim already dealing with a significant injury list, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Centre-backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain absent, while Kobbie Mainoo won't be fit to face Wolves.",
      "\"I don't know how Mase is going to be for that game,\" said Amorim. \"I think Kobbie Mainoo is not going to be ready. Bruno is not going to be ready. I think Matt is not going to be ready. Harry is not going to be ready. So, I think we are not going to have more players.\"",
      "Fernandes is expected to miss a few weeks of action with a minor hamstring injury, but Amorim revealed he is already asking to get back involved in training sessions at Carrington. Mainoo is set to return to first-team training this week, which could put him in the frame to face Leeds on Sunday, but De Ligt and Maguire face longer on the sidelines.",
      "\"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know,\" said Amorim. \"No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is going to start on the [training] pitch also, so we will see. Matthijs is struggling a little bit. Harry the same thing.\"",
      "In his absence, Lisandro Martinez was named captain, but Amorim revealed Fernandes' influence stretches beyond the pitch and praised the way he had continued to back his teammates while injured. The Portugal international has even been watching training after completing his treatment at Carrington.",
      "\"He's always speaking, that's why he's the captain,\" the United head coach said. \"He has bad things sometimes, the way move his arms, but he has a lot of good things.",
      "\"The practice, every time he makes a recovery, he is the guy who is going to watch the other guys' training that day. So there is a lot of things that you guys don't see but that he does. He's a great leader all the time.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there. I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader. The guy is a leader.\"",
      "Wolves are yet to win in the Premier League this season, losing 16 of their 18 fixtures, and United won 4-1 at Molineux earlier this month. The return fixture offers United the chance to end the year on a high and Amorim knows victory is essential.",
      "\"We need to [win], and they show that against Arsenal, they could get at least one point,\" he said. \"So, in the Premier League, you never know. They have their problems, we have our problems but there is no excuses. We need to win, we will try to win the game.\"",

      "There's less than 48 hours until the start of the January transfer window and Manchester United could be among the busiest Premier League clubs in the winter market.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is keen to strengthen up his squad as they look to build on a positive first-half of the season, with the Reds sitting sixth in the table after 18 matches. United spent close to £240million on transfers in the summer, but that amount could rise if the Reds decide to sign players in January.",
      "They are in the shop window for a new central midfielder, with Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba high up on their wanted list. Joao Gomes could be an alternative, with the Wolves man - who plays against United tonight - linked with a move away from Molineux next month.",
      "Elsewhere, players could exit Old Trafford in January. Kobbie Mainoo continues to be the most high-profile potential departure, while Joshua Zirkzee is another that may leave.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest Manchester United transfer news below....",
      "Manchester United have already missed out on one attacking target as we approach the January transfer window in the form of Antoine Semenyo.",
      "However, another name they have been linked with of late is RB Leipzig's Yan Diomande. The Ivory Coast international has been lighting up the Bundesliga this season and it's no surprise a number of top clubs are rumoured to be monitoring his progress.",
      "That said, the latest update from BBC Sport suggests Tottenham are eyeing a move for the 19-year-old as they brace for a potential Brennan Johnson exit next month.",
      "Spurs have reportedly agreed a deal with Crystal Palace for the Wales international, who is set to make a decision on his future in the coming days.",
      "Diomande has been listed as a potential replacement, while Man City's Savinho remains of interest.",
      "Manchester United are unlikely to add any further players to their squad tonight when Wolverhampton Wanderers travel to Old Trafford.",

      "According to Record, Manchester United would be willing to buy Joao Gomes for £43.5million.",

      "Manchester United are thought to be one of three Premier League clubs interested, with Atletico prepared to let him go and allow him to get 'the playing time he deserves'.",

      "The thesis on what has gone wrong at Manchester United over the past dozen years or so could make War and Peace look like a children's book, but if there is one area in particular that can be held up as a costly failure, it is recruitment. A failure of joined-up thinking and a lack of diligence have resulted in hundreds of millions being wasted on players who are not up to the task.",
      "In terms of on-pitch success, recruitment is the biggest differential. It explains why United have fallen so far in recent years, but is there light at the end of the tunnel? This year hints at brighter times ahead, and a £245million spending spree across two transfer windows has delivered value.",
      "The £1.5million deal to sign Ayden Heaven in January looks like a steal, and while the jury has been out on the £25million addition of Patrick Dorgu in the same window, he has had his best games for the club in the past week and scored his first goal on Boxing Day.",
      "The summer saw around £218million spent, with Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving. Lammens has been installed as the first-choice goalkeeper after an £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp and has started encouragingly, and Mbeumo has been a revelation after his £71million switch from Brentford.",
      "Cunha is starting to deliver on a consistent basis after his £62.5million move from Wolves, and there have been flashes from Sesko, who is 22 and learning a new league after joining from RB Leipzig for £73million.",
      "That success rate offers encouragement that things are looking up at Old Trafford, with Jason Wilcox now installed as director of football and Ruben Amorim's side starting to deliver on the pitch. Amorim attributes the recruitment to a bit of luck, but also explained that it was now a more collaborative process and that he wasn't just getting his own way.",
      "That is something Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been trying to change since taking charge of football operations after his minority investment, bemoaning the approach of letting managers sign the players they want before then changing the manager and appointing someone with a different style.",
      "\"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason and the board has another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager, because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything. But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player will not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "United have ramped up their data department since Ratcliffe's investment, but as well as crunching the numbers, they are also putting in the work to discover a potential signing's background, and for all the success so far of the recruits under Amorim, he is demanding more from his new boys.",
      "\"We try to make all the assessments of how they live, how they train, the characteristics,\" he said. \"I think we did well but I think they have more to give.",
      "\"If you talk about Cunha, for example, Ayden is a young guy, Cunha and Bryan are our league, so it's easier for them to perform.\"",

      "United's captain has been side-lined since before Christmas after limping off at the interval of the narrow defeat against Aston Villa. As a result, he missed the Boxing Day win over Newcastle United, and the visit of Wolves has seemingly come too soon for the midfielder.",
      "That will no doubt come as a bitter blow for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers up and down the country, who will surely have hoped he would be back available sooner rather than later. Fernandes is valued at £9.2m and has amassed the joint-highest points tally for a midfielder, alongside Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Unfortunately not. Although the midfielder is pushing for a swift return to the pitch, it's expected he will be side-lined until early January.",
      "Speaking in his pre-Wolves press conference this week, Amorim confirmed he is not expecting to have his captain available for selection. \"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know,\" the Portuguese coach said this week. \"No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance.\"",
      "Amorim was also quick to point out Fernandes' leadership and the importance of his presence in the dressing room. His absence for the upcoming games comes as a major blow as a result.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there,\" the United boss continued. \"I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader.",
      "\"He can't be that guy that when he's not playing, he's not talking and speaking. He's always speaking.",
      "\"That's why he's the captain. He has bad things sometimes, the way he moves his arms [gestures on-field], but he's got a lot of good things, too.",

Amorim switched shape for the first time as head coach in the Boxing Day win against Newcastle and could stick with it against Wolves.",
      "After showing signs of flexibility for the first time in his 14 months in charge at Old Trafford, Amorim suggested a back four would be for life and not just Christmas, even when key men return over the next few weeks.",
      "Amorim shifted shape with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away on international duty, while injuries have mounted with Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes all on the treatment table. But Amorim insisted he had always planned to evolve during his time in charge and only resisted doing so until now to avoid giving the impression he had caved to media pressure.",
      "He has played the 3-4-2-1 shape, which he had success with in Portugal, almost constantly at United, and felt it was important to use that system to bed in the principles he wants to instil at the club.",
      "\"First of all, it's a process. When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim. \"We are trying to build an identity.",
      "\"Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing. It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\"",
      "Amorim has often stressed that, regardless of the shape, the principles of play will remain the same for his side. However, having finally moved away from a wing-back system, a back four that supporters have been crying out for might be seen more often as his tenure enters a new phase.",
      "That flexibility will also present more headaches to opponents. Newcastle were confused to see United set up in a back four on Boxing Day and took their time to work out what they needed to change.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said.",
      "\"But that was something that I was talking about. But when you talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I'm changing because of you [the media], and, I think, that is the end for the manager.",

      "\"Hojlund is a player who is very young, he's still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,\" Conte explained. \"Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he's starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to face Wolves in the Premier League on Tuesday evening, but both managers will be without a handful of key players.",
      "The two sides faced each other only a matter of weeks ago in the reverse fixture at Molineux. On that occasion, Ruben Amorim's men ran out 4-1 winners, courtesy of a brace from Bruno Fernandes and goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount.",
      "As things stand, United sit sixth in the league standings, just three points outside the top four. Wolves, on the other hand, are rock bottom and winless in their 18 games so far, with their latest setback coming in the form of a 2-1 loss away at Liverpool last weekend.",
      "On the back of their Boxing Day triumph over Newcastle, in which Patrick Dorgu scored the only goal of the game, Amorim will hope his side can continue their winning ways this week. However, the United boss will have to navigate the visit of Rob Edwards' side without a number of key men.",
      "Club captain Fernandes remains sidelined after picking up a hamstring injury in the defeat to Aston Villa earlier this month. Amorim revealed in his pre-Wolves press conference that the midfielder is already asking to resume training at Carrington, but he is expected to remain sidelined for a couple of weeks.",
      "United are also sweating over the fitness of Mason Mount after he limped off against Newcastle on Boxing Day. It is not yet clear whether he will be ready for the visit of Wolves on Tuesday night.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt have also been sidelined in recent games through injury, and Amorim confirmed he does not expect to have any of them back in time for the next match. Mainoo, in particular, is expected to resume training this week, which makes Leeds United at the weekend the likeliest return date.",
      "In addition to injuries, Amorim is also navigating a number of absences due to the Africa Cup of Nations. Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Mbeumo make up the United contingent representing their nations at the tournament in Morocco over the next month.",
      "From a Wolves perspective, defender Rodrigo Gomes underwent surgery on a groin injury last month and is not expected to return until February. Toti Gomes is nursing a hamstring problem and will be sidelined until the new year.",
      "Jean-Ricner Bellegarde is also expected to return at the start of 2026 after being out of action with illness, while Marshall Munetsi is recovering from a calf injury.",
      "Leon Chiwome has been sidelined since January with an ACL injury and no return date has been set. Aside from injuries, Edwards will also be without Emmanuel Agbadou due to the Africa Cup of Nations, while midfielder Andre is set to serve a one-game suspension following an accumulation of yellow cards.",
      "After the midweek visit of Wolves, Amorim's men will be gearing up for a tricky start to 2026, beginning with a trip to Leeds United this weekend. That is followed by an away fixture against Burnley at Turf Moor, an FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton and the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "England legend Gary Lineker has revealed he shares the same agent as Manchester United defender Ayden Heaven, and that the 19-year-old is in good hands.",
      "The teenager has risen to prominence at United since his move from Premier League rivals Arsenal earlier this year. After making a handful of appearances under Ruben Amorim last term, he has been more heavily involved this season, particularly with mounting injuries in defensive areas.",
      "Heaven has made several appearances across all competitions this term and has featured in the last five league matches. That run includes a standout performance in their recent narrow win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Lineker, an England legend who represented the likes of Leicester City, Barcelona and Everton during his playing days, has offered some insight into the team supporting Heaven’s development at Old Trafford. Lineker is represented by long-standing agent Jon Holmes, who works alongside one of Heaven’s representatives, Andy May.",
      "\"We have the same agent,\" Lineker revealed on this week's The Rest is Football podcast. \"Andy [May] looks after him.",
      "\"He's in good hands. He came to Ballers League with me last season. He's a nice lad.\"",
      "Alongside May, Heaven is also represented by his mother, Lisa, and both played a significant role in securing his move from Arsenal to United earlier this year. \"Delighted to have assisted Ayden Heaven with his transfer from Arsenal to Manchester United, alongside Karim Bouzidi and Lisa Heaven,\" May shared in a social media post back in February.",
      "\"It has been a pleasure during the past couple of years to witness Ayden’s development as a footballer and person. This significant move, and the confidence shown in him by his new club, is a testament to his talent, dedication, and ambition.\"",
      "Heaven's recent performance against Newcastle was the latest example of his continued development and impressed the pundits watching on. Former Manchester City star Micah Richards, in particular, feels the youngster has all the tools to become a top defender.",
      "\"He reads the game really well for a young player,\" he chimed in, also speaking on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Physically, he can deal with it and he's strong enough.",
      "\"He's quick enough. But he reads the game well, and for a young player to read the game like that [is fantastic]. I thought it was a really good performance from him, and they needed him because of [the injuries].\"",
      "Heaven will hope to have another opportunity to prove himself when United host Wolves at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. With Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt still recovering from injury, Ruben Amorim could turn to the youngster once again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win against Newcastle United was one of his best as Old Trafford boss after his injury-hit side held on to a valuable three points against the Magpies. United were down to the bare bones after losing Mason Mount at half-time and they had to hold on during a second-half onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that temporarily moved them into fifth in the Premier League.",
      "Although United have produced more convincing performances under Amorim, the Portuguese head coach hailed it as one of his best wins during his 13 months in charge and insists the spirit they showed could be valuable in spreading belief through the squad.",
      "Asked if the win was one of his most enjoyable, he said: \"Yeah, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six, but we suffer together, and that is a good feeling. I felt we are here talking about the game, and if we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. We need to feel we can win games without playing so well and win with spirit and togetherness.\"",
      "It was just a second clean sheet of the season and Amorim felt the luck was on United's side against Newcastle when it has deserted them at other times this season. \"The feeling is good but if you compare to other games we suffered so much more today, but in certain moments we put everything on the line,\" he said. \"We’re defending every cross, trying to push out the box, that is a good feeling to have but we had so many games we controlled much better and conceded a goal.\"",

      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "When the teamsheets dropped at Old Trafford, it didn't look like it was the night when Amorim changed his ways, but Patrick Dorgu was right-wing rather than left-wing back. That change caught Newcastle by surprise.",
      "On the touchline, Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall debated a solution, while the Newcastle analysts sat in the press box tried to work out what was happening. The shrugging of shoulders showed they hadn't been expecting this.",
      "A few weeks ago, Amorim had talked of the anxiety he could feel whenever Dorgu was on the ball, so when he watched his left-wing-back-cum-right-winger settle over a dropping ball 16 yards from goal, he probably didn't expect to see a sweetly struck volley whizz past Aaron Ramsdale and into the corner of the net.",
      "Dorgu visibly grew in confidence after that. He forced Ramsdale into a smart save soon after and contributed defensively with one thunderous tackle on Lewis Hall that earned a chest bump from Casemiro, but the loss of Mason Mount to injury at half-time turned this into a rearguard effort.",
      "Fabian Schar saw a shot deflected just wide from a corner and was furious when Newcastle were denied a penalty when his shot was blocked by the arms of Lisandro Martinez. Lewis Hall hit the bar from distance and Anthony Gordon dragged a shot narrowly wide.",
      "United's attacks were few and far between. Benjamin Sesko clipped the top of the bar with a left-footed shot in his last action before being replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, part of a double change that saw Leny Yoro come on, giving the hosts the chance to drop into a back six when required.",
      "And it was needed regularly as Newcastle piled on the pressure. Diogo Dalot and Dorgu were wingers dropping in at full-back as Yoro and Luke Shaw went narrow.",
      "Senne Lammens saved from Joelinton and plucked a cross-shot from Joe Willock out of the air. Anthony Gordon should have done better than swiping a shot over after good work by Harvey Barnes, Schar looped a header onto the roof of the net and then Lewis Miley fired wide from 12 yards.",
      "It summed up Newcastle’s wastefulness in the final third as wave after wave of attack came to nothing. It wasn’t convincing from Amorim’s side, especially after the break, but after four successive defeats without Bruno Fernandes in the Premier League, victory was all that mattered.",
      "Fernandes was in the directors' box to watch his teammates go into battle without him. Amorim had talked of how difficult it was to replace the captain on Christmas Eve and with Mount missing as well, United's creativity is being tested. That this game finished with Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson on the pitch, as well as the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia, said everything about the resources Amorim now has at his disposal.",
      "He will need to continue to find solutions over the next few weeks, but the fist-pumps that greeted this victory showed how valuable it was, and the sight of Lisandro Martinez blowing kisses to the Stretford End was a reminder that at least one key man is back in the groove. The Argentine was vital to this defensive effort and proved to be the perfect stand-in for Fernandes.",

Altay Bayindir, Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee and Tyrell Malacia were the only first-team options on the bench.",
      "Rooney believes the options Ruben Amorim can call on need bolstering, saying: \"When I look at the squad and the bench, what they've got there, they really need players in to try to help them challenge to get into the top four.",
      "\"Listen, it's great to see the young players on the bench and getting opportunities, but it needs to be at the right time as well, and it's not; it's not sustainable at all. They need players in. They've obviously lost some important players, and Bruno [Fernandes] is a big loss.\"",
      "Injuries to Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Kobbie Mainoo have depleted the squad Amorim can select. Mason Mount also had to come off at half-time against Newcastle.",

      "Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui are also absent, representing their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations. Those three will return at some point in the New Year, with the tournament concluding on 18 January.",
      "Rooney was far from impressed by the display against Newcastle. He said on Match of the Day: \"I was worried when I saw the performance, if I'm honest.",
      "\"The manager changed the formation and went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for. I know they didn't concede a goal, but they didn't look comfortable, and Newcastle were putting them under pressure, especially in the second half.\"",
      "He continued: \"The home games under Amorim, you look at the possession from the Newcastle game, 33 per cent at Old Trafford, I know when the fans go to that stadium they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses in the box and getting shots in. It was a poor performance, but they found a way to win.\"",
      "Amorim has also acknowledged that the team did not play very well. He said after the match: \"We played two games in one. We had to suffer, all together, in the stadium and in the game.",
      "\"It was really difficult for us. We did good in the first half, but, in the second half, we just defend and try to do something with [Matheus] Cunha.",
      "\"We had our opportunities with transitions, but it was a good win. I had so many games here, saying we played really well but didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Today was the opposite. We suffered together and managed to win the game.\"",

      "Football coaching can be a lonely pursuit at the best of times, never mind when facing the potential of being fired. So it's understandable Wayne Rooney may have felt somewhat abandoned when his wife, Coleen, was conspicuously absent as he faced his dismissal at Plymouth this time last year.",
      "It was almost exactly one year ago that Rooney took charge of the Pilgrims for the final time. The Devon side journeyed to Oxford on December 29, 2024, in dire need of points to boost their Championship survival chances against a similarly struggling opponent.",
      "Many managers might anticipate seeing family in the crowd for moral support during such pivotal moments. However, Coleen was noticeably absent during Rooney's crucial match.",
      "Instead, she was enjoying some festive football at Goodison Park, where she watched local club Everton play against Nottingham Forest. Rooney's other half shared a photo from the directors' lounge on Merseyside, nearly 300 miles away from her husband.",
      "Ultimately, it turned out to be the final straw for Manchester United legend Rooney. A 2-0 defeat at Oxford proved to be his last challenge as Plymouth boss, and he left the club just two days later.",
      "Rooney exited Home Park with a record of five victories and 14 defeats from 25 matches at the helm. Although not as disastrous as his tenure with Birmingham City, he nonetheless left Plymouth without having enhanced his reputation as a coach.",
      "He then took another hit when replacement Miron Muslic proved far more effective during his five-month tenure. The Austrian coach even hinted Plymouth might have staved off relegation had he been brought in earlier.",
      "It was always understood Coleen wouldn't be relocating with Wayne to the south-west. Providing stability for their four young sons remained paramount, although she recognised the arrangement was far more manageable than during his stint with DC United.",
      "\"We see him a couple of times a week, which is good,\" Coleen revealed to the Sunday Mirror in September 2024. \"He went to America, so this is a bonus because even though it seems like far away, it's easier to get to than Washington, DC.\"",
      "She added: \"We thought long and hard about it (moving to Devon) but with the kids it didn't work. Kai's now in Year 10 and just starting GCSE prep, and everything's going well with football, and the other boys are all settled at school.",
      "\"So it didn't seem fair on the children to pick them up and take them away, and start in a whole new place. It's manageable. It's life. Other couples and families have similar situations and have to get on with it.\"",
      "Twelve months after his Plymouth exit, there's little indication of a new managerial opportunity emerging for Rooney. Nevertheless, he might need to consider roles nearer to home if he wants his devoted spouse present in future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The 19-year-old has started five games in a row for United and has raised his performance levels during that run, producing an outstanding display in a rearguard defensive effort in the 1-0 win against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Heaven, a £1million signing from Arsenal last January, has had to be patient for his chance this season but he has taken it when the opportunity arrived and was selected ahead of Leny Yoro against Newcastle. The teenager was named man of the match on TV as United showed tenacity in the second half and Amorim was delighted with the youngster's display.",
      "\"Really pleased with Ayden, he’s improving every game,\" he said. \"He’s young but you don’t feel he has a good game and slows the thinking. \"He was not playing but he trained really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. If he continues to play like that it’s going to be hard to take his place.\"",
      "Heaven started in a back four against the Magpies and that meant Patrick Dorgu reverted to right-wing, netting his first goal for the club with a stunning volley. It was his best performance since joining United last January and Amorim felt the freedom afforded the Denmark international in a more advanced role played into his hands.",

It depends on the team or the game,\" the United head coach said. \"Maybe the game today, with a lot of transitions, is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball. He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "Amorim also reserved praise for Lisandro Martinez, who captained the team in the absence of Bruno Fernandes and on his first start since February 2.",
      "\"He’s a guy with a lot of character, really good on the ball, he won the World Cup, he’s used to that stress and showed today he is a top player,\" he said. \"He’s a small guy but today he did really well against a team who has tall players.\"",

Other names on the list include Nottingham Forest's England international Elliot Anderson, who has been in fine form this season. However, the Daily Mail is reporting that Garner is moving up the priority list, with the player already having the approval of captain Fernandes.",

      "Future planning aside, United are struggling for numbers in the middle of the park right now, with Lisandro Martinez, a centre-back, playing there off the bench against Aston Villa recently. Injuries to Fernandes and Mainoo will prompt Amorim to dip into the January transfer market to acquire reinforcements.",
      "Garner, whose Everton contract expires in the summer, could be a shrewd acquisition for United, with the player spending four years on the books at United, although most of his time was spent out on loan.",
      "Everton are trying to negotiate a new deal for Garner, who has impressed at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it's understood United may try to get their man in January.",
      "It has now re-emerged that skipper Fernandes thinks very highly of Garner, and you'd imagine the Portuguese superstar would be keen to see the Birkenhead-born player return to Old Trafford.",
      "In an exclusive Q&A on the Manchester United website in 2021, Fernandes spoke about how much the younger players impressed him during pre-season.",
      "\"I think we know some of them already,\" began Fernandes. \"Jimmy Garner, I think is a really good player, I really like him and the way he kicks the ball.",
      "\"He’s really aggressive off the ball too. [Anthony] Elanga was already playing with us and this pre-season he has been brilliant. He’s a nice kid, works hard and is really humble and I think he’s deserving of everything that’s happening to him. I see a brilliant future for him and Jimmy too, and also for all the other kids.\"",

      "United were pinned back for much of the second half and had to produce a defensive rearguard to hold on to the lead given them before the break.",
      "Senne Lammens: Good save from Guimaraes in the first half and solid after the break as Newcastle piled on the pressure. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Back in a familiar right-back position and moved into the attack in the second half. Tested by Gordon and had to run back with Hall as United sought to hold on. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Starting ahead of Yoro was a show of faith from Amorim and did well against Woltemade. Confidence is returning after a spell on the sidelines. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Won a header against Woltemade in the first half and found his passing range again. Named captain on his return and defended very well. 8",
      "Luke Shaw: A first start at left-back in 18 months. The odd shaky moment but came through it well and saw off Murphy in the second half. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: His Cruyff turn in the first half summed up the confidence United were playing with. Still not great in possession but battled hard without the ball. 7",
      "Casemiro: Surprised to see his number go up early in the second half. Missed a good early chance but couldn't control the game after the break. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Took his goal brilliantly and visibly grew in confidence after that. Diligent defensively and remained a real threat running forward. Best game for United. 8",
      "Mason Mount: Set the tone again with some excellent pressing in the first half and some fine link-up play. Would be a big miss if he is now on the injured list. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: A livewire performance in the first half but struggled to influence the game after the break. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Much better than of late. Hit the bar with his final touch of the game but held the ball up well in the first half and looked stronger. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Jack Fletcher: Surprised by the pace and physicality of the game early on but settled well. One good pass to get Dorgu in behind Miley. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Read the game well at right-back and contributed to a solid defensive effort. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Barely saw the ball as United retreated. 6",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Antoine Semenyo could break into the top five most expensive January transfer window signings ever, but would still be a mile behind some Liverpool genius.",
      "The Bournemouth forward should move for £65m in January, and the club expected to sign him already feature regularly in this list of the 20 biggest January deals of all time.",
      "",
      "Nine years in Portugal was enough for Brazilian forward and one-cap international Galeno, who wished not to examine the mouth of Al Ahli’s gift horse when it came galloping along in January 2025.",
      "A respectable nine goals, seven assists and two trophies since suggest he was right not to hesitate.",
      "",
      "Considering the Leipzig recruitment model, the idea was likely always to move record signing Simons on eventually at great profit. They likely didn’t expect that to happen within seven months.",
      "Despite the Dutchman’s best efforts, Leipzig failed to qualify for the Champions League in the season they made Simons’ loan permanent. As a result, he informed them of his desire to leave and the poor thing ended up at Spurs of all places.",
      "",
      "Quite comfortably the closest any player has come to replicating what Rodri does for Manchester City, it required a half-season of acclimatisation for Gonzalez to take on board what Pep Guardiola wanted in the middle.",
      "Since then he has become a vital cog in an improving machine. Gonzalez has missed a single game for Manchester City in 2025/26 – and it was one of the few they have lost.",
      "",
      "The transfer which so infuriated Daniel Levy, the supposed master negotiator seething at another club for negotiating. Diaz was a fine addition to further regenerate the Liverpool attack.",
      "They even made a massive profit on the 28-year-old when Bayern Munich started sniffing around. But was the sale of Diaz a catalyst for this rough season?",
      "",
      "It still feels bizarre that Torres played eight more Premier League games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool. The goal haul despite that – 20 at Chelsea and 65 at Liverpool – points to a career trajectory that suffered a sharp fall upon his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "And yet his four years with the Blues yielded a Champions League and Europa League trophy each, with no Anfield trinkets whatsoever.",
      "",
      "Back before Barcelona used economic levers to sign players with money they absolutely didn’t have, the Blaugrana fed their transfer addiction through old-fashioned means like overdrafts and bank loans. We’ve all been there.",
      "They could have plucked Torres from Valencia for £20m or so about 18 months beforehand but shut up that’s why.",
      "",
      "The most transformative signing at United since Robin van Persie. Just a shame the club are dragging him down with them.",
      "",
      "A miserable end should not obscure a mutually beneficial and temporarily happy union. Only eight players who played in the Premier League era have scored more goals for Arsenal than Aubameyang – and of those players, only Ian Wright and Thierry Henry scored more goals per game. If only he was more punctual and non-negotiable.",
      "",
      "One of football’s greatest mysteries is how Chelsea managed to sell a 29-year-old Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid for £57m despite the striker being very publicly surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge, as painstakingly proven by Antonio Conte’s text message dumping him straight after they won the title together in summer 2017.",
      "Costa had not played professional football for seven months by the time he returned to the Spanish capital; his La Liga record during that second spell was 61 appearances, 12 goals and 17 yellow cards, as well as an eight-game suspension he received for abusing a referee.",
      "",
      "Perhaps swayed by Liverpool breaking the world record for biggest transfer fee ever spent on a defender earlier that same month, Manchester City settled for Laporte.",
      "It wasn’t all a smooth ride but five Premier League titles in six years tells quite the compelling story of a player for whom City recouped £23.6million from Saudi in 2023.",
      "",
      "It did not going to plan for Pulisic, who might well suggest that playing for and being coached by three different managers in nearly four years at a time of immense upheaval has not helped. Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter all struggled to harness the American’s talents.",
      "And Maurizio Sarri was managing the Blues when the deal was put together. Still, he’s fairing rather better in Milan now.",
      "",
      "A rare case of a January signing immediately thriving in his first half-season before suffering from some delayed growing pains.",
      "Marmoush had an argument for being Manchester City’s best player in 2024/25, contributing eight goals and three assists to a struggling team finding their feet again.",
      "But with Erling Haaland firing and Guardiola figuring things out, Marmoush has found solace largely on the bench as the anniversary of his arrival looms.",
      "",
      "A decent 2024/25 for Kvaratskhelia, all things considered: 13 goals and 11 assists in 51 appearances for Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as winner’s medals in the Champions League, Ligue Un, Serie A and Coupe de France.",
      "PSG capitalised on Kvaratskhelia laughably low wage in Naples and neither club nor player have looked back since.",
      "",
      "Receiving £57m for an unwanted Costa was a quite ludicrous magic trick from Chelsea, but even they would be hard pushed to outdo the £60m they raked in for Oscar, practically a reserve, in 2017.",
      "Jamie Carragher described it as “embarrassing” for the Brazilian, but he can probably live with the shame. Or wipe his tears away using crisp £50 notes.",
      "",
      "Oh boy. You will have read a lot about this being an £89m transfer but the truth is that Chelsea would only have paid £89m if everything went swimmingly. And it has not.",
      "After we were told the Ukrainian winger only wanted to join Arsenal, he signed an eight-and-a-half-year contract with Chelsea. Almost three years on, Mudryk has flopped hard and is currently on the sidelines after being charged with a doping offence.",
      "",
      "Those few weeks when Duran was legitimately probably the single greatest forward ever to walk the Earth were glorious.",
      "Aston Villa and Unai Emery tried to resist his brilliance but could only hold out for so long before indulging on the back of his 11 Premier and Champions League goals in 866 minutes in the first half of the 2024/25 season.",
      "They equally could hardly avoid cashing in when the Saudi coin arrived. And considering Duran can now be found on loan at Fenerbahce less than a year later, it must be categorised as another decisive Villa win.",
      "",
      "The football world scoffed along with Vlahovic at the Sophie’s Choice he was presented in January 2022. After breaking numerous records with Fiorentina, the young striker could have taken his pick of interested clubs.",
      "Arsenal were predictably – and justifiably at the time – rejected in favour of a move to Juventus. What could have been. Arsenal might have been spared their biggest mistake of 2025.",
      "",
      "This was the most expensive January deal ever when it went through on the first day of 2018 and the size of the fee took everyone by surprise. But it turns out that it was basically a bargain for the lynchpin of one of the most formidable teams in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "A deadline-busting deal that was on and off for much of January and only at the very last definitively on. Chelsea ended up going over and above Fernandez’s 120million euro release clause in exchange for a payment structure that suited their needs. Those needs primarily being ‘spread the cost as much as possible across the massive eight-and-a-half-year contracts we give out now’.",
      "Has he been worth it? Meh. Probably eventually.",
      "",
      "Liverpool were merely delaying the inevitable when they resisted Barca’s three offers in summer 2017. The Spanish side had to wait half a season and chuck another £20million at the Reds but finally they got their man and Coutinho got his move.",
      "Not that either he or the buying club will look back on the deal fondly. Liverpool, though, haven’t stopped laughing about one of the best pieces of transfer business ever.",
      "This list is an absolute hive of scum and villainy, topped by two men who will doubtless retain their places in 2026.",
      "There is plenty to be optimistic about Liverpool, Arsenal and even Man Utd; why listen to the nonsense?",
      "Bloomin’ loads happened this year, but how closely were you paying attention? Test yourself with 25 questions on the winners and losers in 2025…",
      "Arsenal host Aston Villa, Man City have a huge test at Sunderland and Eddie Howe takes Newcastle to Burnley knowing he’s on the brink. It’s a Big Midweek.",
      "The sight of Evangelos Marinakis sat seething in his customary City Ground seat on Saturday almost closes a villainous 2025.",
      "But if you want a good player and can’t afford big club rejects, Middlesbrough FC should be your first port of call."

      "But the move would be dependent on United letting him go, and while in the summer that might be possible, if they don’t sign a new midfielder in January, with Fernandes currently out and Mount having struggled with injuries in the past, as well as Kobbie Mainoo’s potential exit, it would be a risk for them to allow Ugarte to leave in the middle of the season.",

      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United will make a ‘U-turn’ on letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club during the winter transfer window on one condition.",

      "The England international allowed his contract at Anfield to tick down to expiry last summer as Alexander-Arnold made himself unpopular with Liverpool supporters.",
      "Alexander-Arnold was booed on his return to Anfield this season with Real Madrid, who paid a fee to get him out of Liverpool early to play in the Club World Cup, as the Reds got the better of the La Liga side in a 1-0 win in the Champions League.",

      "The report adds: ‘Among the clubs most closely monitoring his situation are Manchester United and Newcastle United, two ambitious projects looking to bolster their defenses with a proven player. In both cases, offers are reported to be around €40 million. Significant sums, but insufficient to convince Real Madrid, who have no intention of letting him go.’",

      "“I also think that Mo [Salah] is missing him, that connection that they had. Yes, sometimes they would get exposed in behind, but they would have someone try and cover that position – last season it was mostly [Dominik] Szoboszlai, previous to that would be Jordan Henderson.",

      "Former Serie A striker Giampaolo Pazzini has described Rasmus Hojlund as the “strongest” striker in Italy right now, alongside the league’s top scorer.",
      "Hojlund left an underwhelming spell at Manchester United for a loan to Napoli this term. If certain conditions are met, Hojlund will be signed permanently by the Serie A club in the summer.",
      "Last season for United, Hojlund scored just four goals in the Premier League, with slightly better returns of six in the Europa League.",
      "From just 11 Serie A games this term, he has reached four goals – with two assists – and also has two Champions League goals to his name.",
      "Hojlund seems a better fit in Italy than he was in England, and according to Pazzini, he’s one of the very best strikers in the Serie A.",
      "Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. Since he arrived, he has undergone an incredible transformation.",
      "“He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse. Conte took him, educated him and raised him.",
      "“Now he’s a fantastic striker because he plays for the team, he doesn’t make a single mistake, he never gets anticipated, he plays short, he plays long, he’s vicious in front of goal.",
      "“Now he’s decisive throughout the match and you also find him in the defensive phase.”",
      "Inter Milan striker Martinez is currently the top scorer in Serie A with nine goals, alongside three assists, and Christian Pulisic is the only other player who’s scored more goals than Hojlund this term.",
      "As such, it’s high praise that Hojlund is seen as level with Martinez, who has not failed to surpass 10 Serie A goals in any of the last six seasons, and has 124 goals in the league over his career.",
      "Conte is clearly happy with the progress of the Manchester United loanee, as he said recently: “Hojlund is a player who, first of all, is very young, but above all, has a lot of room for improvement.",
      "“He’s becoming a dominant player in that position. He’s very connected to the team. In my style of football, everyone knows that strikers have a very important and unique role.”",
      "Should the conditions be met for Hojlund to sign permanently at Napoli, they’ll part with €44million (£38.3m) for him. Given he’s currently one of the league’s top scorers and has helped his side to within two points of top spot in Serie A, he seems worth that fee.",
      "A new report has explained why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been ‘bothered by’ two of his teammates this season.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",

      "The utter failure of these three to even put up a fight allowed certain clubs who shall remain nameless (not really, we’re going to name them literally immediately in this list) to completely sack the league off with no consequence. Well, no relegation-based consequence anyway. Infuriatingly bad.",

      "Sure, everyone took the p*ss a bit but we still feel like this just isn’t talked about enough. Manchester United should be too embarrassed to leave the house after something like that. But it didn’t even cost anyone their jobs.",

      "He didn’t come from nowhere. We’ve all been dimly aware of the outlandish cartoon villain in charge of Forest and his entertaining ways, but 2025 was his year in so many ways. This was the year where his main-character energy achieved mainstream crossover.",
      "It’s been a spectacularly prickish year for the big man, and who knows what 2026 may bring. We do really quite seriously want to see him run on to the pitch, ageing iPhone in hand, to remonstrate with Sean Dyche as he did so infamously with Nuno Espirito Santo towards the end of last season.",
      "We’re absolutely certain Dyche wouldn’t just stand there and take that utter woke nonsense like beta cuck Nuno did.",
      "That wild incident was key to the whole Marinakis character arc of 2025, though. Because what he was beyond furious about was that Nottingham Forest – Nottingham Forest! – had only managed to draw with Leicester and this had dented their Champions League – Champions League! – chances.",
      "The breathtaking speed with which entitlement took hold of Marinakis and Forest on the back of being Quite Good for Quite A While in an all-time-weak Premier League year was stunning to behold.",
      "Running out of steam on the home straight and not quite making it into the Champions League was, for Marinakis and others, an absolutely unacceptable end to a season that began, as all seasons for all but a handful of teams must, with avoiding relegation trouble as the primary goal.",
      "That Marinakis was so furious with the man more responsible than any other – himself included – for Forest being in a position where he was able to get quite so dangerously high on his own farts was just profoundly ungrateful and enormously Marinakis.",
      "The public nature of that specific outburst cemented his status. He was a main character now. And boy has he spent the rest of the year doubling down on that with some elite villainy.",
      "With Daniel Levy gone, Marinakis is now the Premier League club suit most likely to be pictured sat watching from the stands and requiring commentators, by ancient law, to say ‘penny for his thoughts’.",
      "And the great thing with Marinakis is that you don’t really need to spend that penny. Unlike the expressionless round head of Levy, Marinakis’ thoughts on any situation at any time are writ large across his features. Especially when he’s happy, but especially when he’s angry.",
      "Happy moments of Marinakis behaviour this season have included the entirely normal photo op he staged with Morgan Gibbs-White after convincing the number 10 to sign a new contract entirely and definitely of his own free will. That incident also reminds us that even acts of villainy can have unexpected outcomes; saving Gibbs-White from joining Spurs was far more of a kindness than any of us could have predicted at the time, even allowing for the undeniable and unending fact that Spurs are Spurs.",
      "There was also the undisguised glee he had over Forest’s promotion to the Europa League at Crystal Palace’s expense. We sort of admire the complete lack of pretence there. There was at least an honesty to it rather than some performative attempt at ‘Not the way we wanted to qualify but…’ response.",
      "This season, Marinakis’ core work in maintaining his profile and expanding his role has been to fall back on an old favourite. Manager sackings. Shrewd work. After the wild behaviour of the summer, there was no need to overcomplicate things. Why not simply fall back on a tried-and-trusted tactic?",
      "Nuno was doomed from the moment of that on-pitch dressing down, really. The surprise if anything was that a flimsy and unconvincing ceasefire lasted until a fair way into the new season. But not far enough for Nuno, the man who had just delivered Forest’s best league finish in 30 years, to claim victory in the Premier League Sack Race.",
      "Marinakis was only warming up, though, following that dramatic flourish with his greatest act of hubris yet. So quickly and utterly had Marinakis lost sight of where Forest had been just a year earlier and how quickly they could return to that status, that he appointed Ange Postecoglou.",
      "An absurd decision that still managed to exceed the most dire predictions, which were very dire indeed. And it’s only a matter of time before Dyche goes the same way in 2026 because this is just how Marinakis now rolls.",
      "Are Forest fast becoming the Premier League’s most unlikeable club?",
      "",
      "He’s football’s problem now. We’ve invited him in and now we don’t know what to do about it, do we?",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists summer signing Benjamin Sesko has reminded him of former Red Devils striker Louis Saha this season.",
      "Sesko signed for the Red Devils in the summer transfer window in a deal worth around £74m from Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also joined as Man Utd spent almost £200m on new attacking players after being the fifth lowest scoring side in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Sesko has been largely disappointing in his appearances for the Red Devils this season with two goals and one assist in 15 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Ferdinand’s podcast host Joel Beya claimed that Sesko has not “hit the ground running the way he was supposed to” but Stephen Howson reckons he does the dirty work so Cunha and Mbeumo can thrive behind him.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand added: “I couldn’t agree with Steve more.",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Arsenal v Villa, Eddie Howe on the brink, Man City, Matheus Cunha v Wolves…",
      "“Sesko [offers more] than [just] goals. Yes, the strikers will be judged on their goals, but internally sometimes there are things that they bring to the table that you go, ‘You know what, that is huge’.",
      "“You know who was like that? Louis Saha. He was never going to win the Golden Boot at Manchester United.",
      "“But in terms of his value to the team, he was a joke some of the stuff that he would do to enable others to play better.",
      "“He would get us up the pitch at times, he would hold the ball for three or four seconds at times to give us a breather.",
      "“Forget goals with him. His all-round game… I was sitting there sometimes going, ‘Oh my God, I’m so happy he’s on our team’.",
      "“I think with Sesko, listen, we still want to see the goals. But I’ve seen a few parts of his game that I go, ‘Oh the other players are liking that’.",
      "“I can see it. Manchester United haven’t had a striker who can just hold it up or flick it on for ages. Like just a simple little thing but effective.”",
      "However, former Man Utd striker Teddy Sheringham has been disappointed by what he’s seen and insists the Red Devils should have signed Harry Kane.",
      "Sheringham said last month: “Manchester United are asking too much of Benjamin Sesko. It’s a massive job to lead the line for them, the expectations are enormous.",
      "“It’s always going to be tough for a young, inexperienced striker like Sesko to come into a club like Manchester United and hit the ground running. The club already tried that approach with Rasmus Hojlund and it didn’t work out.",
      "“For me, United should have bought Harry Kane to lead the line when they were searching for a new striker. He would have guaranteed you 20-25 goals every season.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are *finally* evolving for the better, but Kobbie Mainoo and five teammates will be the six victims of these changes…",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker insists that Joshua Zirkzee is “nowhere near the level” of Benjamin Sesko and doubts he will “ever” come good.",

      "It’s the time of the year when we are blessed with plenty of midweek Premier League football.",
      "It’s the best part of December, much better than Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve. Unless you’re a Newcastle United fan, who needs more excuses to get drunk and forget all of their problems…until the hangxiety kicks in and they realise their team are 14th in the Premier League.",
      "There are some belting matches. We have a genuine title clash between Arsenal and Aston Villa, while second-place Manchester City face a brilliant Sunderland team in their cauldron.",
      "It’s going to be great. Strap in for a Big Midweek.",
      "",
      "After five games this season, nobody expected Aston Villa to turn things around to the extent that they’d be on an 11-match winning run and in the title race with Arsenal and Manchester City. Back then, they were winless and had only just scored their only 2025/26 Premier League goal. Oh and Liverpool boasted a 100% record. How times have changed.",
      "The most recent Villa win came at Chelsea on Saturday evening, in a true Game of Two Halves. In the opening 45 minutes, Unai Emery’s side might as well not have been there. In the second period, they were absolutely fantastic and two Ollie Watkins goals got them over the line.",
      "It will be a tactical battle between Mikel Arteta and Unai Emery. The latter seems to have his compatriot’s number, especially at the Emirates, which he once called home. Emery has righted the wrongs of his Gunners spell with his outstanding work at Villa Park and seems to have taken his sacking personally – why wouldn’t he? – with a title-denying victory in north London in 2023/24 and a 2-2 comeback draw last season. Not to mention literally beating them 2-1 at home earlier this month.",
      "One big advantage for Arsenal is Villa’s suspensions. Emery will be without right-back Matty Cash and holding midfielder Boubacar Kamara, whose absence really cannot be understated. The Frenchman has been brilliant and incredibly consistent, but having Amadou Onana as a direct replacement isn’t too shabby, while Youri Tielemans is capable of filling Kamara’s role.",
      "But there is no doubt that Kamara’s absence gives Arsenal the edge over their title rivals. Revenge will also be on the mind due to the freshness of Emi Buendía’s last-gasp winner on December 6.",
      "It’s a huge game that is hard to call. Villa’s winning run should make them favourites in any match, and their favourable record under Emery at the Emirates – and how important the aforementioned win and draw were – could give them a psychological boost. Win and the Villans go joint-top on 42 points. Lose and it’s six points, with the rest of the Premier League hoping it’s the start of their title push fading away.",
      "",
      "",
      "We are spoilt for choice in this department. Howe’s opponent on Tuesday, Scott Parker, is someone we suspect is on the brink. And then you have Andoni Iraola, with Bournemouth winless in nine, Nuno Espírito Santo, with West Ham in the bottom three, Rob Edwards, who is reportedly on the brink of being sacked with Wolves still on two points, Enzo Maresca after Chelsea capitulated again, and Thomas Frank, the Spurs head coach on his return to Brentford.",
      "But it has to be Howe.",
      "He has never been closer to the sack. They ought to have scored at Old Trafford, but they didn’t. Their performance at Sunderland was simply pathetic. They have only won once away from home in the Premier League this season. They have five wins on the road in 2025, three of which came between January 4 and March 10.",
      "It feels like Newcastle need a new voice, new ideas, new formations, new signings. They just look like they need change. And unfortunately, despite big players like Anthony Gordon and Sandro Tonali and big signings like Anthony Elanga underperforming, it always comes back to the manager.",
      "The mental and physical edge that Howe’s team once had has completely eluded them all season. They have had first halves like the one against Chelsea, but followed them up with absolutely dismal second halves and capitulations. Late goals have cost them dearly at home, and simply crumbling under the pressure of an away day has become more than a fear…it’s become an expectation.",
      "Not only do Newcastle need a rare away win, but they need to look good. They need to be Howe’s Newcastle at their best. There has to be a glimmer of hope that this team is capable of putting a decent run of results together, and that Howe and his management are what will make something of this season.",
      "But now imagine if they lose at Burnley…",
      "",
      "Man City left it late to see off Nottingham Forest on Saturday, with Rayan Cherki once again providing the goods with a go-ahead assist and match-winning goal. Cherki will likely start in attack with Erling Haaland and Phil Foden when Pep Guardiola’s side face Sunderland away from home on Thursday.",
      "In the 2025/26 Premier League, Sunderland haven’t lost at home and have scored in all nine of their matches. They have beaten Newcastle United, drawn with Aston Villa and Arsenal, and come from 2-0 down to beat Bournemouth 3-2. This is a serious test for City, whose last league defeat came in the north east against the Magpies.",
      "Since then, they’ve won six in a row and also beat Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. They’ve not had the most brutal of fixture lists, but the manner of some victories – three consecutive 3-0s and showing mettle to edge out tough opponents on the road like Forest – have really strengthened their position in the title race with Arsenal.",
      "But there have been examples over the last six games of City wilting. They conceded four at Fulham and almost dropped points from 5-1 up. A tactical switch by Leeds United turned a comfortable 2-0 lead into needing a 91st-minute winner. City are capable of looking very vulnerable, and you’d back Sunderland to make it very uncomfortable for them under the Stadium of Light lights.",
      "It’s another big test of their title credentials and comes 48 hours after Arsenal potentially drop points against Villa. If they do and City win, they’ll go into a matchday above their rivals for the first time since beating Wolves 4-0 on week one.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Villa ‘genius’, ‘irrelevant’ Howe, Raya, Nuno sack, Man Utd and Liverpool",
      "",
      "Against his former club on Tuesday, Cunha will be the attacking player Ruben Amorim leans on for inspiration against a historically crap team. Wolves were smashed 4-1 by Manchester United earlier this month but have only narrowly lost at Arsenal and Liverpool since. Perhaps they are more of a threat on the road and shouldn’t be taken lightly by a very unreliable group of players and head coach.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are at the Africa Cup of Nations, Benjamin Sesko’s stock is falling, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes are injured. It’s a crucial game for Cunha and, given the opposition, the perfect opportunity for a statement performance.",
      "Amorim is likely to stick with a back four and how his team attempt to break down a deep block will be very intriguing to see. A pivot of Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro isn’t ideal, while there’s a strong chance young Jack Fletcher starts in the No.10 role, with Patrick Dorgu on the right wing after his winner against Newcastle last Friday.",
      "But in a potentially beatable line-up, Cunha might be the only player you’d back to produce something brilliant. There’s a genuine chance Wolves turn those narrow defeats at Anfield and the Emirates into something better at Old Trafford. This is not a given; nothing is for Man United. But Cunha can and should be the difference-maker against his old club.",
      "",
      "Slim pickings here, but we have a full Football League fixture list on New Year’s Day, which is just fantastic.",
      "Out of all 36 matches on Thursday, we reckon Southampton against Millwall will be the tastiest affair.",
      "Both clubs have promotion aspirations but are on poor runs, winning none of their last three games. They met as recently as November 29, when it finished 3-2 to the Lions, who came from two goals down to win courtesy of a 97th-minute Tristan Crama goal. More of the same, please.",
      "",
      "It would be rude to ignore the wonderful competition that is the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "There’s enough on the line in Group F for the final matchday to be interesting, with Mozambique hoping to cause an upset against Cameroon to knock them down to third.",
      "While Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s Gabon take on Ivory Coast, Mozambique will face Cameroon on a high after earning their first-ever AFCON victory against Gabon.",

      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports.",
      "The Ghanaian forward is one of the hottest properties in the Premier League due to a £65million release clause in his Cherries contract.",
      "Semenyo has been in outstanding form this season, registering nine goals and three assists in 17 Premier League matches.",
      "His performances have caught the attention of the Premier League’s Big Six, with Manchester City and Manchester United emerging as the two frontrunners for his signature.",
      "Liverpool were initially expected to win the race for Semenyo but opted against signing him until it was too late. The winger also “politely” turned down Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea chose not to pursue him, and Arsenal felt they didn’t need another attacker.",
      "Understandably, Semenyo prefers a move to Manchester City over United.",
      "Should he move to the Etihad, he would join a Premier League title contender and feature in the Champions League. On the other hand, a move to Old Trafford would see him join the biggest club in the country, but one without European football and not guaranteed to have it next season.",
      "Now, Ben Jacobs reports that Semenyo’s move to City should be finalized within the next two days.",
      "Writing for talkSPORT, Jacobs states that Bournemouth ‘expect’ the deal to be ‘formalized’ this week for £60m plus add-ons.",
      "Semenyo has already agreed personal terms with City but is still likely to feature against Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday.",
      "The report adds that the deal has advanced ‘following positive talks on Monday over the structure of payments related to Semenyo’s release clause.’",
      "With the timeline confirmed, it’s now looking highly likely that City will secure Semenyo as soon as the January transfer window opens.",
      "The 25-year-old will add further depth to an already stacked attack, which includes Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, and Jeremy Doku.",
      "Semenyo’s ability to play anywhere across the front three makes him a valuable addition for Pep Guardiola, who is aiming for his seventh Premier League title in 10 years.",
      "After three stellar years on the south coast, Semenyo will be another key player in Guardiola’s attacking setup.",

      "Manchester United welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to Old Trafford on Tuesday evening looking to close out 2025 with back-to-back Premier League wins.",
      "After edging past Newcastle United on Boxing Day, United have a chance to build momentum against a Wolves side rooted to the bottom of the table and running out of time.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s team were far from fluent last time out but found a way to win, with Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley settling a tight contest. A switch to a back four saw United concede territory and ride their luck, yet they held firm to secure just their second clean sheet of the league season.",
      "That result continued a steady upturn at Old Trafford. After winning only four of his first 14 home league games, Amorim has now overseen five victories in the last eight, lifting the mood around the club despite ongoing squad disruption.",
      "Still without a league win this season and now 16 points from safety, Wolves have lost 11 straight Premier League games and look increasingly destined for the drop.",
      "United have won eight of the last 11 meetings between the sides, including a 4-1 victory at Molineux earlier this month, and will expect to assert control again against the league’s leakiest defence.",
      "United remain stretched, with Bruno Fernandes still absent and Mason Mount a major doubt after being withdrawn at half-time on Friday.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are all sidelined, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui remain away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is expected to stay involved after an eye-catching performance against Newcastle, having now been directly involved in two goals in as many games. He should again support Benjamin Sesko alongside Matheus Cunha.",

      "Wolves continue to battle personnel issues, particularly in defence, with Toti Gomes and Emmanuel Agbadou unavailable.",
      "Rodrigo Gomes, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Marshall Munetsi, Daniel Bentley and Tawanda Chirewa are also sidelined, while Hugo Bueno has returned to action.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for form, Tolu Arokodare could continue up front alongside 18-year-old Mateus Mane as Wolves search for solutions.",
      "Sa; Mosquera, S. Bueno, Krejci; Doherty, J. Gomes, Andre, H. Bueno; Hwang, Mane; Arokodare",
      "– Manchester United have won eight of their last 11 Premier League games against Wolves.",
      "– United beat Wolves 4-1 at Molineux earlier this month.",
      "– United kept just their second league clean sheet of the season against Newcastle.",
      "– Patrick Dorgu has been involved in two goals in his last two games after just one involvement in his first 36 appearances.",
      "– Wolves are winless in 18 Premier League matches this season.",
      "– Wolves have lost 25 league games in 2025 and could equal the all-time Premier League record with another defeat.",
      "United should have enough to take all three points, but their defensive record suggests Wolves will not be completely shut out.",
      "Amorim’s side remain vulnerable at the back and have struggled for clean sheets all season, even in games they control.",
      "Wolves continue to lose, yet they have competed in spells under Rob Edwards and should find opportunities against a United defence that has rarely looked settled. That makes backing United to win while conceding a goal a sensible middle ground.",
      "Man United to win and both teams to score appeals here, especially given Wolves’ tendency to stay involved before eventually falling short.",
      "United’s matches have rarely stayed tight, while Wolves’ defence continues to give up chances in volume. Over 2.5 goals fits the pattern of how both sides’ games have played out across the season."

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed why it’s now the time to change formation at Manchester United, as buckling to media pressure previously would have been “the end” for him.",
      "Amorim has fervently stuck by his 3-4-2-1 formation at United. He used it to good success with Sporting CP, though similar formations are more common in Portugal.",
      "It was suggested that his decision to take the United job hinged on the club allowing him to stick with his formation.",
      "In the early stages, there were massive struggles for the Red Devils in adapting, and it has only been of late that the side truly looks like they have adapted.",
      "But with some important players missing, such as Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim finally decided to switch his system, playing 4-2-3-1, with left wing-back Patrick Dorgu playing on the right-wing.",
      "Amorim has revealed in a press conference why now is the time for a change, and why he never buckled to pressure from people suggesting he needed to change when United were struggling last season.",
      "He said: “When I came here last season, I understood maybe I don’t have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of a process.",
      "“We were trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don’t have a lot of players, and we need to adapt, so they understand why we are changing.",
      "“It is not because of the pressure of you guys [media], or the fans.",
      "“When you [media] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand I’m changing because of you and I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "“When we are playing well in our system, that is the moment to change.",
      "“We are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play with three defenders all the time.”",
      "Fernandes’ injury might not last very long, though Amorim has confirmed he’s going to be out for the next game.",
      "He said: “Bruno is already saying he needs to train. But there is no chance he is going to play against Wolves. No chance. You can write that.”",
      "Meanwhile, Dorgu is likely to stay on the right-wing, and has revealed the role is not difficult for him.",
      "He said: “I’ve done that at my old team as well, so it’s nothing new to me. I knew already a few days ago, so I just tried to remember how to play there.",
      "“It’s the same [as wing-back], just you come inside to your stronger foot, so sometimes it’s even easier to attack and connect with the team-mates, so I find it really easy.”",

      "The Ghana international has been the subject of interest from many of the top clubs in the Premier League with Man City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Man Utd interested in Semenyo.",
      "However, news emerged last week that Semenyo had chosen Man City as his ‘preference’ in the January transfer window with the Citizens prepared to trigger his £65m release clause.",
      "There had been reports of a potential hijack from Liverpool but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed overnight that Man City ” remain convinced” they will seal a deal.",
      "Romano said: “In the last hours today, we had stories coming from England about Liverpool trying to hijack the deal for Antoine Semenyo.",
      "“What’s the situation now? Liverpool have always been calling for Semenyo. They started calling in November, they continued calling before Christmas, and they kept on calling during the recent days to understand the situation.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Villa ‘genius’, ‘irrelevant’ Howe, Raya, Nuno sack, Man Utd and Liverpool",
      "“But I can guarantee to you that as of Sunday night, Liverpool have never approached Bournemouth to start a conversation or to tell them: ‘Okay, we’re going to pay the release clause.’",
      "“This didn’t happen because the player’s preference is to go to Manchester City. Man City remain convinced that Semenyo wants to join them and they will try to seal the deal for Semenyo as soon as possible.",
      "“His £65 million release clause is valid until 10 January, so City and Bournemouth will be in contact again over the next few days to try to close the deal for Semenyo.",
      "“Liverpool are calling on the player’s side to understand the situation, but at the moment they are just calling. If Liverpool go into action for the hijack, I will let you know.",
      "“Man City have an agreement with Semenyo, and Man City are talking to Bournemouth – something that Liverpool, as of today, are not doing.”",
      "But The I Paper insists that ‘sources close to Semenyo believe he is perhaps making a mistake in joining City, given he would not be a guaranteed starter’.",
      "Whereas at Man Utd he would be a ‘perfect fit for Ruben Amorim’ with the report adding: ‘If the besieged United boss sticks with his beloved 3-4-3 system, Semenyo could slot in as an attacking wing-back, on the opposite flank to Amad Diallo.’",
      "On Man Utd looking for an alternative, the newspaper adds: ‘The deal is not signed yet, but City are confident they have won the race. United will therefore try look for an alternative, but they were interested in Semenyo as an individual – they will not necessarily look for another wide option.’",
      "Former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson has revealed how the Citizens can afford a deal for Semenyo “no problem” in the January transfer window.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I would expect them to be able to do the deal no problem, but to be looking to move players on either in January or, of course, in the summer.",
      "“I think the list of candidates is pretty clear. That said, a couple of those players who I would say are likely candidates, players like Rico Lewis and Savinho, were players that they had the opportunity to sell last summer and decided not to, so we’ll see.",
      "“But I think they can do the deal now on Semenyo. I would caution as to whether they can do many more deals without selling.”",
      "Former Liverpool man Jermaine Pennant thinks it’s “really stupid” that the Reds haven’t put themselves in the position to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports.",
      "Man City are edging closer to sealing a deal to sign Liverpool and Man Utd target Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo is still likely to sign for Man City over Liverpool in January.",
      "Paul Merson has backed Antoine Semenyo to head to Tottenham rather than Manchester City, amid a question over Pep Guardiola and the potential role the forward would play.",

      "In the summer, the Atalanta man was upset that his club were not allowing him to leave, having previously stated they would do so.",

      "Only Martin Dubravka has made as many saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet following at Brighton.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham before returning to help beat Man Utd. The win at Chelsea was his quietest afternoon for a while, with only three shots to save.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale, though, has hardly made the place his own so Pope could be back quickly now he’s fit.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. A clean sheet at Palace should do wonders for Vicario and Spurs before their next collective shambles.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",

      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range.

      "",

      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs.",

      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric.

Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham.",

      "According to Caught Offside, Hoffenheim’s Ivorian winger Bazoumana Traore is ‘rapidly emerging’ as one of the ‘most closely monitored young attackers’ in Europe.",
      "He is on the radar of United, as well as Brentford, Arsenal and Newcastle, all of whom are said to have made initial background checks and done data-driven scouting on the winger.",
      "Scouts from the aforementioned sides are said to have been ‘particularly impressed’ by Traore’s ability to operate in transition-heavy systems.",
      "While he has largely played as a left-winger, Traore has also played in a less advanced role during his career.",
      "So far this term, the Ivorian has two goals and five assists in 14 Bundesliga games, with his assists tally already the best of his career.",
      "While there are other clubs on the scene for Traore, that he plays in the same national team as Amad could help United to convince him Old Trafford is the place he should land at.",
      "However, while he’s in good touch at club level, there could be a question over whether he’s ready to play for United, and what role he’d play there.",
      "Traore, while in the Ivory Coast African Cup of Nations squad, is yet to play in the tournament and add to his solitary international appearance, with Amad taking the left-wing spot which he would hope to occupy.",
      "But with Amad playing in a less advanced role himself at United – generally as the right wing-back – Traore might not get the minutes he has been doing at Hoffenheim.",
      "Whether offers come in for him remains to be seen. The report states that the German club would ask for €45million (£39.3m), reflecting his ‘potential and the leverage provided by his long-term contract.’",
      "It feels unlikely that United would pay that for a player they don’t actually need, especially as their priority is to improve their midfield, either in January or in the summer.",

      "Sancho’s contract at Man Utd expires at the end of the season but the Red Devils have an option to extend his deal for a year.",
      "It seems like Man Utd would rather lose out on a transfer fee for Sancho – who joined the Red Devils in a deal worth £72m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 – than risk paying his £300k-a-week wages for another year.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Jadon Sancho is out of contract in the summer transfer window. Man Utd have an option to extend, but from what I’m told, they have already been clear with people close to Sancho.",
      "“Man Utd believe that the chapter of Sancho at Man Utd is closed and there is no chance to find a different way. Sancho will not play for Man Utd again and this is the clear position of the club.",

      "Man Utd have had interest in Antoine Semenyo but Romano has ruled out the Red Devils hijacking Man City’s move for the Bournemouth winger.",
      "Romano added: “Many of you are asking me if Manchester United have joined this hijack attempt. No – Man Utd have not returned to the case. And this is also why Man Utd are waiting to communicate with Roma for Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“Man Utd, via intermediaries, have received an official bid from Roma for Joshua Zirkzee. It’s a loan with a potential obligation to buy. Roma have an agreement with Zirkzee. Zirkzee is ready to go to Roma, but this deal depends on Man Utd.",

      "“Neves’ contract is due to expire in the summer 2026, so in recent months, Al-Hilal made a proposal to Ruben to extend the contract. The proposal is still on the table, but Neves has still not agreed to signing a new contract with Al-Hilal.",
      "“There is no green light from the player and Neves is considering the possibility of returning to Europe in the summer on a free or in January. Obviously, in that case, a negotiation club-to-club would be needed.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",

      "Despite being odds-on favourites at Burnley, Newcastle's recent road form suggests this won't be pretty.",
      "Under Eddie Howe, in a season when they are juggling Champions League football, their record away from home in games played when they've only had three days or less to prepare for a game is horrendous. From 18 fixtures they've won just three of those, drawing seven and losing eight. That includes defeats to Luton, Bournemouth, West Ham and Brentford.",
      "Overall, they've managed just one away Premier League win in their last 12 - a run that's been littered with moments of attacking promise but undermined by poor game management and defensive fragility.",
      "The idea of Newcastle being a reliable bet on their travels doesn't quite ring true given the numbers. At 3/1 Burnley are worth a swing on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Enzo Maresca has been proven right. Chelsea are not in the title race.",
      "After beating Burnley on November 22, Chelsea were three points behind leaders Arsenal. They are now 13 points off the pace.",
      "Bournemouth could be just what Chelsea need right now though. Andoni Iraola's team are winless in nine games and have conceded three or more goals in each of their last six Premier League away games as Iraola's unique style is being ripped to shreds by opposition attackers.",
      "Enzo Fernandez isn't the first name most people gravitate towards in Chelsea goalscorer markets, but his underlying data at Stamford Bridge tells a different story. Across his last 10 home games in the Premier League and Champions League, he's averaging 2.3 shots per 90 - the second-highest figure of any player in that sample.",
      "More importantly, Fernandez is leading Chelsea for expected goals per 90 at home (0.4) across those matches. That's a significant marker. He's consistently getting into areas where chances carry genuine threat - meaning the 3/1 with Sky Bet on his anytime price is chunky.",
      "Nottingham Forest may have fallen short in the end against Man City, but their centre-forward Igor Jesus left with an enhanced reputation and with two of Europe's most accomplished defenders knowing they'd been in a proper fight.",
      "Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol, usually so serene in City's defensive structure, spent much of the afternoon retreating, grappling and fouling - four times between them - as they struggled to contain Forest's physical focal point. More of the same foul drawing numbers are expected up against the likes of James Tarkowski and Michael Keane who will approach the challenge of engaging with their usual meeting fire-with-fire style. The Brazilian striker is 11/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled at least twice.",
      "Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them. And once again they are being vastly overrated by the oddsmakers where they have been chalked up as 11/10 favourites with Sky Bet.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 37 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 18 games otherwise. West Ham are part of that sample size when grabbing a 1-1 draw at the Amex in a clinical and composed performance that was just a few minutes away from landing an away win.",
      "Following the Hammers on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet looks a shrewd move.",
      "Under Mikel Arteta, Arsenal's home matches are defined by fast, aggressive starts. From the first whistle, they squeeze the pitch, dominate territory and look to impose themselves early. That approach has translated into a trend of Arsenal scoring the first goal in 23 of their last 25 home games.",
      "Aston Villa, by contrast, are almost the opposite profile. They're not a side associated with quick starts away from home. In fact, they've scored first in just one of their last 10 away games, often needing time to grow into matches. What they are excellent at is reacting - no team has won more points from losing positions since the start of last season (36).",
      "That tells you everything about how Villa operate: patience first, problem-solving later. Arsenal to score the first goal in the first half at 4/5 with Sky Bet looks a fantastic wager in a game where Villa may come on strong late once again to get a result.",
      "The goal markets suggest we're heading towards a game with around three goals, but it's difficult to see how this contest escalates into anything resembling a shootout.",
      "Yes, Manchester United won 4-1 at Molineux a few weeks ago but United's attacking resources are notably thinner this time around. Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are all absent, which strips creativity and penetration. Without those profiles, United's ability to open up a deep defensive block is far less convincing.",
      "And Wolves will happily lean into that. Expect a very negative, defence-first approach, with bodies behind the ball and minimal ambition in possession. That's hardly surprising when you consider their output this season: just 10 league goals, the fewest of any team across the top four divisions. Goals simply aren't their thing.",
      "Under 2.5 goals is priced as the outsider of the two at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is one of those fixtures where the betting market almost dares you to ignore the most obvious outcome and offers you the biggest price on such an outcome. The draw must be the play here at 23/10 with Sky Bet involving two teams that are neither built to dominate a game and both comfortable in low-risk game states.",
      "Set pieces feel like a key battleground in all Premier League matches now and that's where Anton Stach comes firmly into focus. Leeds have scored more goals from set pieces than any other side in the Premier League this season, while Liverpool sit uncomfortably at the other end of the spectrum, having conceded the most from dead-ball situations. That's a statistical clash you can't ignore.",
      "Stach is on corner-taking duties, which immediately elevates his assist potential. And in games like this, rather than trying to guess which Leeds player finishes the move, it makes far more sense to side with the one delivering.",
      "Stach's role has shifted noticeably in Leeds' 3-5-2 system, with license to operate much higher up the pitch. That tactical tweak has had a clear impact on his output. In his last five games, he's taken 16 shots, effectively doubling his previous shooting numbers, and he's already scored twice from that more advanced position. He is 9/4 with Sky Bet to register a goal or an assist.",
      "Tottenham have the form in the book courtesy of a very routine 2-0 home win over the Bees but the emotional pull of this occasion heavily favours the home side. Thomas Frank was the architect of their rise and his return as the opposing manager will surely sharpen focus rather than distract it. Brentford's players, fresh from an intense and impressive win over Bournemouth, will be keen to prove that the system, not just the coach, still stands strong.",
      "A competitive and awkward contest for Spurs could be on the cards, where their tactical preparation is tested by a Brentford side determined to show they're more than just their former manager - something that's not factored into the prices. A home win looks the play at 5/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side aren't in the business of wild scorelines on their travels. Across City's last 23 away matches, we're seeing an average of 2.6 total goals per game, but that figure is skewed by one total outlier - the bonkers 5-4 at Fulham. Strip that freak result out and the number drops sharply to 2.1 goals per match, which is far more representative of how City manage games on the road.",
      "City don't tend to blow teams away early on the road, instead, they suffocate them. Long spells of possession, territorial dominance and an emphasis on game control rather than relentless attacking risk. There's also the Guardiola festive-period factor, which is impossible to ignore. Between December 26 and January 7, in Guardiola last 16 matches, he's overseen 14 wins and two draws. No defeats. It's a time of year where his teams are drilled, focused and usually a step ahead of opponents. A Man City win and under 3.5 goals is a winner in waiting at 6/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "Monday 29 December 2025 21:32, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City have opened talks with Bournemouth to negotiate the finer points of Antoine Semenyo's £65m release clause.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's representatives are due in Manchester to finalise contract terms as Manchester City open talks with Bournemouth over his £65m release clause.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo, but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Rayan Cherki's creativity for Man City and how his form changes the Premier League title picture. Plus: Jeremie Frimpong's pace helping Liverpool and Ayden Heaven's growing reputation at Man Utd",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 11:20, UK",
      "It was not until the start of November that Pep Guardiola left Rayan Cherki on the pitch for over an hour of a Premier League game. The player provided two assists that day against Bournemouth and has started eight of the last nine Premier League games.",
      "Manchester City have won all but one of them to reignite their title hopes and Cherki's role in that has been significant. Most obviously, he scored the winner against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. But his assist for the opener was more typical.",
      "Cherki has provided seven Premier League assists since the start of November, more than any other player in the competition in that time. It is more than twice as many as all but two players - Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Fulham's Harry Wilson.",
      "The difference is that while Fernandes and Wilson are the set-piece takers for their respective teams, all seven of Cherki's assists have come from open play. No other Premier League player has more than three assists from open play during this period.",
      "The key for Guardiola has been getting Cherki in possession of the ball in those areas of the pitch where he can cause the most problems for the opposition. At Forest, although many of those touches were on the right, he was able to do damage centrally.",
      "All three of the chances that he created, including for Tijjani Reijnders' goal, came from forward passes from central positions. Since the start of November, no player in the Premier League has completed more through-balls than the France international.",
      "Tellingly, that game against the Cherries was the first time that Guardiola had named Cherki and Phil Foden in the same starting line-up. It is seven wins from eight in all competitions with them together since then, the twin playmakers proving crucial.",
      "Back in October, the best case for City reclaiming the title relied on Erling Haaland bludgeoning opponents and covering up the flaws in this team. Now, something is taking shape. There is more to this City. Cherki's impact highlights that clearly.",
      "Rob Edwards was encouraged by Wolves' start but about a quarter of an hour into their game at Liverpool, it changed. \"Liverpool began to force us back,\" he explained. \"They changed one or two bits and got a lot of numbers high so it was hard for us to get out.\"",
      "It was around that time that Arne Slot could be seen on the touchline urging Jeremie Frimpong to move higher up. In the latter stages of the first half at Anfield, the nominal right-back played right up against Wolves' back line. It brought the breakthrough goal.",
      "\"Last week, he had the assist against Tottenham and today he had a great assist against Wolves,\" said Slot when discussing Frimpong in the press conference afterwards. \"Pace, that is what he has and that is so important and crucial in modern-day football.\"",
      "He explained: \"To create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces. Now that is not our biggest strength.\" But Frimpong's pace can help them open teams up another way.",
      "He raced past two Wolves players before crossing for Ryan Gravenberch to score. \"Pure individual ability - quick, bam, bam and a cut-back cross. Okay, we were positioned in the right position, but that is the pace I always wanted to bring in in the summer.\"",
      "This was only Frimpong's second Premier League start since his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, injury hampering his first half-season in a Liverpool shirt. \"Now, if he is fit, he can definitely help us.\" The opening goal in beating Wolves showed precisely why.",
      "A word too for Ayden Heaven, who earned Gary Neville's player of the match award in Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven produced eight clearances and one vital block to help preserve a precious clean sheet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's switch to a back four was a major talking point but whatever the formation it seems that the teenage defender has forced himself into the plans. It is now five starts in a row since coming in for the first time this season against West Ham.",
      "\"I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you do not feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game. No, you feel that he is improving during the game.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So in this moment, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "One recalls Hayden being presented to the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford in February following his signing from Arsenal and there being no great sense that he was someone who would have a significant role to play before the calendar year was out.",
      "United lost that game 2-0 to Crystal Palace with Leny Yoro in the team and now Heaven appears to be ahead of the young Frenchman in Amorim's pecking order. Like Yoro, his progress is unlikely be linear. There will be setbacks. But Heaven's reputation is growing.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",

      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",
