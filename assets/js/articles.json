      "Manchester United have NOT made an approach for Joao Gomes, according to Wolves boss Rob Edwards. The Brazilian features on the Red Devils’ shortlist as they target an overhaul of their midfield under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He features alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid. With the transfer window just over a month away, United are expected to ramp up their efforts of signing a new midfielder soon.",
      "But as it stands, the Red Devils are yet to make an official approach to Wolves over Gomes. Speaking ahead of his side’s 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace, boss Edwards said: \"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised.",
      "“We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "One man who would be a big fan of Gomes moving to Old Trafford is his former Wolves teammate Matheus Cunha. The forward has compared Gomes to current Red Devils star Casemiro amid glowing praise.",
      "He said: \"He is a bit older now but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Gomes, 24, joined Wolves from Brazilian side Flamengo in 2023 and he has gone on to make 104 appearances for the side since then, scoring seven goals. He only signed a new deal with Wolves earlier this year, that contract set to run until 2030, but it is thought that an offer in the region of around £44m might be enough to facilitate an exit.",
      "Gomes remains far from the only option for United in their task to sign a new midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Anderson is a priority target - albeit his £100m price tag could present the Red Devils with a significant issue.",
      "Speaking about potential interest in his star midfielder, Forest boss Dyche said: “It is nothing to do with me, it is the powers that be. They run the club and the financial side. I’m sure they will ask my opinion about the situation, if it is needed - not just about him but about all the players here.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of Matheus Cunha after the forward picked up an injury in training on Saturday. United face Everton on Monday in the Premier League and are already a forward down, with Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines - and now Cunha is a doubt.",
      "The Brazilian forward had been set for a key role in the match at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim likely to field him as a false No.9 in the absence of Sesko. But news of a possible injury blow arrived via an unusual source on Saturday.",
      "Cunha had been due to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening. But the 26-year-old ending up pulling out of the ceremonial role in the town, prompting a statement.",
      "VisitAltrincham wrote on social media: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "That news worried United fans, who already knew their side had been without Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo in Friday's training session. But ESPN reports that Cunha has only picked up a 'minor knock', which sounds a lot less worrying than 'accident'.",
      "Nevertheless, Cunha remains a doubt for the Everton match and will be assessed in the run-up to the 8pm kick-off on Monday. He has managed just one goal in 11 appearances for United so far this season following his £62.5million transfer from Wolves in the summer.",
      "Despite his lack of goals, the Brazil international has been a key player for Amorim in attack, blending well with fellow new arrival Bryan Mbeumo. His importance for Monday's game was increased by the news that Sesko had not shaken off the injury he picked up in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham before the international break.",
      "\"He is going to be a few weeks out,\" Amorim said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Not that serious, we have to be careful. He is feeling better.\"",
      "Amorim said Mainoo would be assessed in Saturday's training session, but Maguire was ruled out of Monday's game. \"Maguire is not ready,\" Amorim said. \"Kobbie didn’t train today but I think we could see Kobbie tomorrow so we’ll see.”",
      "He added: \"There is an opportunity for other players like the under-21s. We will see it is not ideal. They are so important in our team.\"",

      "Manchester United could offer Antoine Semenyo his preferred No. 24 shirt in a bid to lure the Bournemouth forward to Old Trafford in January. The Red Devils are reportedly looking to sign the Ghana international from the south coast this winter and hold a potential edge over other suitors being touted.",
      "Semenyo, 25, has netted six goals and provided three assists in just 11 Premier League matches this season. He is increasingly linked with a mid-season move to the Red Devils as a result and knowing his usual jersey is on offer could play a role in negotiations.",
      "The No. 24 shirt is currently occupied by goalkeeper Andre Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor until the end of the season. But United may not have any qualms about making it available for Semenyo.",
      "This subtle gesture could prove crucial in their pursuit of one of the most sought-after players in the Premier League right now. Onana's future at United looks bleak after a series of blunders tarnished his reputation and the success of Senne Lammens has only made his position more precarious.",
      "The summer recruit from Royal Antwerp has proved to be a steal in United colours thus far. So much so that Onana, who cost £43.4million when he reunited with former Ajax chief Erik ten Hag in 2023, already seems redundant.",
      "Semenyo's availability in January has sparked a lot of chatter after it was revealed the player has a £65m release clause in his Bournemouth contract. The winger signed fresh terms on the south coast over the summer but it's understood he only penned the new contract with the understanding the Cherries would include a release clause.",
      "That's enough to suggest Semenyo, who has previously hinted his preference would be to join Arsenal, would be willing to move if the right opportunity presents itself. And the £65m figure presents a fairly realistic price for the biggest spenders in England's top flight.",
      "Nonetheless, there are perhaps still concerns as to whether United could afford such a splurge midway through the campaign. Ruben Amorim's side recruited Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for a combined fee of around £200m, leaving some question as to where Semenyo would even fit into the XI without dropping one of those players.",
      "That being said, Semenyo has showcased his versatility in just about any attacking role, including the No. 10 position. One solution could see him take that slot off Bruno Fernandes' hands and drop the Portugal talisman into a deeper midfield role.",
      "However, United fans might be disheartened to discover they aren't as highly regarded in the race for Semenyo's signature as others. The Athletic has reported Liverpool and Manchester City are leading the chase for his signature, with both teams likely more enticing to most players at present.",
      "United could also offer Semenyo the No. 9 jersey should they desire. The number has been left vacant after Rasmus Hojlund left to join Napoli on loan over the summer.",
      "While it may seem fairly minimal in the grand scheme of things, having the right shirt number is of major importance to certain star talents. It just so happens Liverpool would also be able to offer the No. 24, though Josko Gvardiol currently wears that jersey for City.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane insists he never meant to cause serious harm to Alf-Inge Haaland with that infamous challenge more than two decades ago. The rivalry between Keane and Haaland started when the ex-Manchester United star ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament during a match against Leeds United in 1997.",
      "Haaland controversially stood over the Irishman and claimed the midfielder was feigning injury. Reflecting on the incident, the former striker said: \"He tried to tackle me and I got the free kick.",
      "\"He was lying on the ground, and I just told him to, 'Get up' as you normally do with players - nothing more than that. I wasn't trying to intend anything against him, but obviously, he took that very hard.\"",
      "This ignited a rage within Keane, who encountered Haaland four years later during a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, with the Norwegian playing for City. Seizing his moment for revenge, Keane went in on Haaland.",
      "He was dismissed for stamping on his knee with considerable force, something he acknowledged wasn't accidental in his 2002 autobiography. He said: \"I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that, you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.\"",
      "Keane was handed a three-match ban and a £5,000 fine initially, but this was extended once he confessed to deliberate intent in his book. An additional £150,000 fine and a five-match suspension were imposed.",
      "The 54-year-old remains unapologetic about his infamous tackle on Haaland, insisting he never intended to cause serious harm. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, he said: \"This is my last time talking about this tackle, the Haaland one.",
      "\"I still don't think it was a bad tackle, I really don't. I don't care what anyone says. It's not as bad as everyone thinks it is. When you play sport at that speed we played at, there's a difference between hurting somebody and injuring somebody - big difference. That's my argument. I was trying to hurt him, not injure somebody.\"",
      "Haaland, who retired in 2003 due to an injury on the leg opposite to the one Keane targeted, has a different perspective. In 2024, he said: \"Is that a coincidence, or isn't it? If you're in the ground and someone hits you in the right leg, you can still twist your other leg. It can get injured and that's probably what happened.",
      "\"I haven't played a full 90 minutes after that incident, that's the hard fact. And people can judge whatever they want. Obviously, I found out afterwards that it was with intent and he was seeking revenge and all these things. I think that's a bit sad. Sad for football and it was not good for me either at the time.\"",
      "Keane maintains that Haaland turned out for his country just four days following the clash and subsequently featured for City. He said: \"Haaland finished the game and played four days later, for Norway.",
      "\"A couple of years later, he tried to claim that he'd had to retire because of the tackle. He was going to sue me. It was a bad tackle but he was still able to play four days later.\"",

      "Manchester United are getting ready to return to action following the final international break of 2025. The Red Devils host Everton on Monday night, aiming to build on the mini-revival that has eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Brighton, United were slightly frustrated with draws away to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. However, following such a troubled start to the season, there are signs that Amorim’s expensive squad is beginning to gel.",
      "Amorim has been left pleasantly surprised by one of his summer signings. The goalkeeper position has been a problem area for United since the departure of David de Gea, with his replacement, Andre Onana, making a string of costly blunders.",
      "Altay Bayındır was given a chance at the start of the season but failed to impress, while Onana was shipped off to Trabzonspor on loan and looks unlikely to play for the club again.",
      "As a result, United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. While it is still early days, the 23-year-old has impressed with some assured performances. Amorim has been delighted to see Lammens look so confident so early in his United career.",
      "He told Stadium Astro: “Of course, we do our diligence when we are going to buy players.",
      "“It was a surprise. All the pressure that we suffer with the goalkeeper position, to arrive here and to show that confidence. To transmit that confidence to the team, I think, was a little bit of a surprise for me.",
      "“I’m not going to say everyone, but I’m talking as a manager. I have no problem to say that was a surprise for me.”",
      "Club legend Bryan Robson wants to see United strengthen their midfield with another player like Casemiro. Having mainly signed attack players in the summer, the middle of the pitch will be an area of focus for Amorim ahead of the January window.",
      "Former Real Madrid star Casemiro, 33, has come in for criticism in recent seasons amid claims that the Brazilian is past his best. But Robson says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves and would like to see another player of his ilk arrive this winter.",
      "Robson told Sportsboom: “People say he’s not this or he’s not that, his legs have gone. Not for me, Casemiro is still a fantastic player, and he would be on my team sheet every time. I think we’d benefit from another Casemiro-like midfielder, that would definitely help us.”",
      "Robson also believes Kobbie Mainoo could still have a future at the club, despite his lack of game time under Amorim. The former Middlesbrough boss added: “I think the future is bright, the club has some great young players.",
      "“I still think there’s a lot more to come from some of these young players, just look at Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“He had so many injuries last year, it really was a stop-start season for him, but you look at the year before and he was outstanding for the last six months of the season. There’s a lot more to come from Mainoo and the other young lads.”",

Pogba hadn't featured in competitive action for two years following a four-year doping suspension that was subsequently cut to 18 months on appeal.",
      "Following 811 days on the sidelines, Pogba can once again consider himself an active player after a brief yet undoubtedly fulfilling 10-minute appearance on Saturday night. Sadly, Monaco were being demolished 4-0 by Rennes when Pogba entered the fray.",
      "Former Arsenal forward Mika Biereth pulled one back deep into stoppage time but strikes from Abdelhamid Ait Boudlal, Mahdi Camara, Breel Embolo and Ludovic Bias had placed Rennes firmly in the driving seat.",
      "Regarding Pogba's performance, he registered 17 touches and completed 14 passes from 15 attempts. In defensive terms, he recorded two ball recoveries and one interception.",
      "The world champion has now revealed his emotions on playing again after being absent for more than two years due to his suspension and subsequent fitness issues.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, as reported by RMC Sport, Pogba said: \"I was disappointed to lose this match. It's Paul Pogba's return, but I play for Monaco, and I don't like losing. I was really happy on one hand, but on the other, I was disappointed with the result and what we did on the pitch.",
      "\"It touched me, the reception. Seeing the crowd stand up and applaud, I wasn't expecting that. A big thank you to the fans who personally supported me.",
      "\"The feeling was good, I wanted to bring good energy, not concede a goal, enjoy myself, it's been a long time. I'm relieved to be back playing football, what I love most in the world. There's still work to do to get back to full fitness.\"",
      "Monaco boss Sebastien Pocognoli had teased a potential comeback for Pogba during his pre-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"We have a session today [Friday] so we'll see. If it goes well, he can be there. He has had a run of sessions, and the feedback is positive. He has been able to test himself in match conditions. There are good signs.\"",
      "It wouldn't have been the comeback to football Pogba would have probably been envisioning, but simply being back playing the game he adores will have almost certainly felt like a monumentally important milestone.",
      "Pogba will now be hoping to step up his involvement over the forthcoming weeks and also feature in the Champions League for the first time in more than three-and-a-half years.",
      "Monaco face Cypriot outfit Pafos next Tuesday as they aim to build upon the five points already secured from four fixtures. Pogba's team then take on defending Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain that weekend.",
      "After signing for the French side as a free agent in June 2025, Pogba was given a tailored training plan to get him match fit. His return was expected against Paris FC earlier this month, but a minor injury put his comeback on hold.",

      "Scott Minto believes that Liverpool should avoid signing Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window and go all-in for Marc Guehi. Arne Slot has struggled to find his stride in the Premier League this season, with the heart of Liverpool's defence proving particularly problematic.",
      "The side have shipped 20 goals thus far, with their previously impenetrable defence of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate looking far weaker in 2025/26 for one reason or another. Elsewhere, summer signing Milos Kerkez has suffered teething problems since his £40million switch from Bournemouth this summer, while Jeremie Frimpong has been plagued by hamstring injury.",
      "As a result of the latter's issues, the Reds have been forced to utilise the likes of Dominik Szoboszlai as a makeshift right-back to compensate. The club have also been hampered by an inability to create and put away chances this term, despite major acquisitions in the form of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak.",
      "And while some may be quick to point the finger of blame at Slot's strike force as the catalyst of their qualms this term, others have highlighted how the back line may need further investment when the transfer window re-opens. Speaking on talkSPORT this week, Sam Matterface asked Minto and Alex Crook why they would be tempted to splurge on Crystal Palace skipper Guehi in January, given he will be available as a free agent in the summer.",
      "To which, Minto replied: \"Because questions are being asked now. Are they even going to finish in the top four? But lets see, he’s not just a short-term fix, he’s an £80million footballer.",
      "\"He's an £80million pound footballer that they could have got for £35million but for things going on elsewhere, and if they had put down £40m, £45m they probably would have got him straight away. And yet what do we think the problems are with Liverpool right now?\"",
      "Crook then added: \"I don't think Liverpool are in any kind of financial situation because they went for a couple of transfer windows didn't they? Didn't spend anything, and actually you look at their net spend which is what I was talking about…Their net spend in this summer transfer window was £218million pound less than Arsenal so I think they have got the funds.\"",
      "To which, Minto explained: \"So I would I would bring in Marc Guehi rather than Antoine Semenyo,\" before Crook asked: \"Because Van Dijk and Konate have been vulnerable?” The former Chelsea and West Ham star then replied: \"Absolutely.\"",
      "Liverpool chased Guehi's signature this summer in a deal which very nearly looked like going through until the eleventh hour. While Liverpool looked to have snagged a deadline day transfer for the England international to the tune of £35m, Palace eventually blocked the move as a result of struggling to find a replacement in time.",
      "Should Liverpool ditch their endeavours of signing Semenyo in favour of trying to strike a deal for Guehi, it would be fantastic news for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils were also linked with the Ghanaian over the course of the summer, before he ultimately committed his future to the Cherries in a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "However, it was recently reported that Bournemouth may be powerless in fending off interest from potential suitors in January, given Semenyo's contract is said to hold a £65m release clause which can be activated by any club. While United bolstered their attacking line with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, they could still seek further firepower as they look to qualify for European football for 2026/27.",
      "And given Semenyo's impressive haul of six goals from 11 games this season, they may opt to pick up where they left off in tailing the 25-year-old this summer when the January transfer window blows open.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sancho has seen his career turn into a nightmare since joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021. The winger failed to make an impact and ended up returning to Dortmund on-loan in 2024, following a public bust up with then United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "While back at Dortmund, he helped them reach the Champions League final. Sancho spent last season on-loan at Chelsea, who refused the option of making the move permanent last summer.",
      "Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, but has struggled for game time and made just four league appearances. He knows he needs to leave English football behind once again next summer, but it remains to be seen if he is willing to reduce his wage demands.",
      "Sancho can leave United on a free transfer in June when his contract expires, and will be able to negotiate signing on fee with a new club. He can start talking to interested clubs in January.",
      "The winger had a successful four-year stint with Dortmund between 2017 and 2021, netting 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games. It was by far the best period of his career, which was derailed by his £73million transfer to United in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has managed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, where he fell out with Erik ten Hag and was exiled by Ruben Amorim. Things haven't started well for him at Villa, either, with minutes hard to come by under Unai Emery.",
      "The Villa boss even embarrassed him by substituted Sancho on and off against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 minutes against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has turned to the club's youth system for answers, as several Manchester United stars prepare to jet off for the Africa Cup of Nations. AFCON gets underway on December 21 and continues until January 18.",
      "Numerous high-profile Premier League stars will be departing their clubs to represent their countries as a result. For Amorim, this could mean losing the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui - all crucial players - for potentially a full month.",
      "He said: \"It is a circumstance that we already knew, but it is an opportunity for other players. We also have the Under-21s and we need to also send a message in that time, so we will see. But of course, it is not ideal because they [Amad, Mazraoui and Mbeumo] are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad. But our Academy is for this moment, and we will be ready.\"",
      "At the tender age of 18, Lacey has already demonstrated his football prowess both for United's academy teams and on the international stage. He has donned the England jersey at U15, U16, U17 and most recently U20 level.",
      "For United, he made his U18 debut at a mere 15 years old and now regularly graces the pitch for the U21s. In terms of stepping into a £71million Mbeumo's shoes, the youngster offers speed and flair down the right wing.",
      "Lacey also has the ability to transition into an attacking midfield role, a trait that will undoubtedly delight Amorim. While he may not have Mbeumo's physicality, Lacey compensates with his nimbleness and technical skills, effortlessly breezing past defenders. He's also earned a reputation as a free-kick maestro at academy level.",
      "Mantato has been part of the United family since he was just nine years old. Now 18, he has proven his mettle in high-pressure situations, including scoring a last-gasp winner to defeat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup quarterfinals earlier this year.",
      "Born and bred in Manchester, Mantato can operate as either a forward or full-back. This adaptability fits perfectly into Amorim's strategy, which employs a back three and two offensive-minded full-backs who surge forward during counter-attacks.",
      "Much like £32.5m star Amad, Mantato is a skilled dribbler with blistering pace down the flank. These qualities, coupled with his versatility, make him a prime contender to fill the void left by Amad's temporary departure.",
      "Kamason became the first player from United's Emerging Talent Programme to secure a professional deal. Former U18 lead coach Adam Lawrence told The Athletic his position is \"predominantly as a full-back, but he likes to get forward and can affect the game higher up the pitch.\"",
      "This perfectly matches the type of full-back Amorim depends upon. Kamason possesses the ability to surge forward, skip past opponents and whip in threatening deliveries - qualities that would suit Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha perfectly.",
      "He has also demonstrated his capability to cope with the physical demands of defending whilst switching seamlessly between defensive and attacking phases, and could make the perfect replacement for a £17.6m Mazraoui.",

      "Gary Neville has told Jamie Carragher he could be \"in trouble\" this season following his earlier Premier League predictions. The Manchester United legend was joined by the Liverpool icon for the latest episode of The Overlap this week, where the pair discussed their respective clubs and recent form in the top flight.",
      "When Carragher addressed Liverpool's defensive issues during their chat, he emphasised how Arne Slot must sign a centre-back in January. That gave Neville the chance to ask whether failing to do so would allow United to finish above their fierce rivals come the end of the campaign, with Carra less than impressed with the cheeky dig.",
      "He responded: \"I don't think so,\" before turning the ribbing back on Neville. He continued: \"You're desperate for that aren't you? He got ridiculed, didn't he, for his predictions? So, I'm well aware every week he's on the phone to people at Sky saying, 'Well, what did Cara say in the predictions? What what did they say?'\"",
      "Neville then dismissed Carragher's joke, responding: \"Well, my predictions, as we've established in the first day, Monday Night Football are more accurate than yours over time. But I actually think this season you're in a bit of trouble.\"",
      "In a lighthearted exchange, Carragher quipped: \"I'm going to lose my job or something because I got my predictions wrong?\" as the panel erupted in laughter. When Ian Wright asked what the pair were discussing, Neville explained: \"Well, he had Liverpool winning the league.",
      "\"I had United in the top four, didn't I? They could sneak into fifth. Do you reckon they could finish fifth? Get into the Champions League.\"",
      "It comes as Neville may have secured bragging rights over Carragher following Liverpool's disastrous performance against Nottingham Forest at Anfield on Saturday.",
      "Slot's team endured a crushing 3-0 defeat on home turf, with goals from Murillo, Nicolo Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White sealing the deal.",
      "Consequently, the Reds now find themselves positioned below Manchester United in the table, with the Red Devils also holding a match in hand as they're not scheduled to resume Premier League action until Monday night's clash with Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Just goal difference separates United and Liverpool, who occupy 10th and 11th place respectively at present, though Ruben Amorim will be eager to establish breathing space over Slot's squad when his side do battle with the Toffees next week.",
      "United and Liverpool have experienced contrasting fortunes from their last five matches, with United going into their game against Everton undefeated in their last five, courtesy of victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "On the other hand, Liverpool have only managed a single win from their last five Premier League outings, suffering defeats to United, Brentford, Manchester City and Forest. Their sole victory from the period comes in the form of a 2-0 win over Aston Villa.",

      "Matheus Cunha has reportedly suffered an accident in training for Manchester United. The Brazilian forward had returned to his club to link up with Ruben Amorim and his team-mates ahead of United's clash with Everton on Monday evening.",
      "But it has now emerged that Cunha has suffered an accident on the training ground. The 26-year-old was due to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening.",
      "However, VisitAltrincham announced that the player would no longer be attending due to 'medical reasons.' The organisation posted on Instagram: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "Several key players missed the opening session of training, however, including Benjamin Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo - all of whom are nursing various injuries. The news comes as United aim to improve their Premier League position when they welcome a revitalised Toffees outfit under David Moyes' guidance on Monday.",
      "The Red Devils are heading into the match with an impressive unbeaten streak in their last five games, thanks to victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "Sesko suffered a knee injury during United's game against Spurs before the international break, and he's not expected to be back until December. Maguire also had to be substituted during the same match due to a hamstring problem, with Amorim confessing that he \"is not ready\" for the upcoming game.",
      "Mainoo, on the other hand, missed the Reds' match against Spurs entirely due to an injury, but there's a chance he could make an appearance at the Theatre of Dreams on Monday, depending on his recovery. In other news, Lisandro Martinez might finally make his much-anticipated return to Premier League action against the Toffees.",
      "The Argentinian defender has been out of action since February due to an ACL injury, but reports suggest he's close to regaining full fitness. The 27-year-old was back in full training ahead of the international break, but Amorim decided not to play him straight away.",
      "Despite not getting a call-up for his country, Martinez did join up with Argentina to train and continue his journey to full fitness during the break. Speaking about the chance of him playing on Monday evening, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing,\" - a comment that will surely delight United fans across the globe.",

      "Dortmund have slapped a £75m price-tag on the German international, which is more than what United were willing to pay.",
      "And to make matters worse, Adeyemi has made it clear that if he leaves Dortmund ahead of next season, his preferred destination is Arsenal and not United.",

At the beginning of 2024, out of carelessness and without really thinking about what I was doing, I ordered a so-called ‘mystery box’ on the internet.",

I understand nowadays this is a business and we need to respect that also – the TV companies give us a lot of money to control that but I prefer to play at weekends because it’s a family moment. Old Trafford is always full, so it’s going to be a very good moment.”",

      "His breakthrough into mainstream media came after a standout performance in the Sidemen charity match, leading to his Soccer Aid debut at Old Trafford - just months before being selected for I'm a Celeb alongside his good mate and rapper Aitch. Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, was known for filming himself at United games, but one particular clip sparked a significant backlash.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the Baller League manager frequently shares videos of his adventures playing Sunday League football and managing his Winton Yanited team.",
      "During United's 3-0 victory over Everton in November 2023, Ginge recorded himself participating in the contentious 'Feed the Scousers' chant in the away end - a video that garnered millions of views. The chant, set to the melody of the Christmas charity single 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' by Band Aid in 1984, makes light of food poverty.",
      "Following an overwhelming negative response, Ginge, who was brought up on a council estate and raised by his mother and nan, issued a heartfelt apology on his social media platforms after discussing with his Liverpudlian friends and understanding the meaning of the chant.",
      "\"I've just seen the tweets that are going around about the chant I sang at the Everton game,\" he penned. \"I'm so sorry I sang that chant, I got caught up in the moment and didn't think about what it actually meant.",
      "\"I've been told by some of my scouse mates that it's mocking poverty, and I want to say I'm so sorry I sang it and if I offended you. I've come from that background, on a council estate and ate £1 microwave meals every night.",

Ginge has been put forward for the very first bushtucker trial, with both he and Ruby Wax participating in the first eating challenge at 'The Divey' in an attempt to win meals for camp. If he is chosen to undertake a second consecutive trial, he will then be exempt from the next one due to a new rule introduced for this year's show.",
      "Angry Ginge is capturing the hearts of a new generation during his stint in I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, and his latest confession about being sober has even more people praising him.",
      "In the comments, someone wrote: \"I loved seeing the conversation around sobriety (as someone is over two years in) and how they were all so honest and open about it. Hopefully it makes a difference to someone younger than me!\"",
      "Another gushed: \"Angry Ginge is HUGE for the younger male demographic. He’s a fantastic role model and on a program that’s extremely popular. Both my daughters are in relationships with boys (18 & 20), and they are far too cool to watch this usually. However, both are LOCKED IN to watch Angry Ginge and defo agree with what you say\".",
      "And a third said: \"He's absolutely brilliant. My 14-year-old boy absolutely loves him. And has actually been watching I'm a Celeb with me. He barely comes out of his room normally. Ginge is an absolute sweetheart, so is Aitch, two great role models for young men and teenage boys\".",

      "The Red Devils were always going to add more firepower in the summer and were linked with several strikers. Ruben Amorim's history with Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Lisbon, where he was prolific, led to inevitable links but the Swede headed to Arsenal.",
      "United landed Sesko for £74million, following a transfer battle with Newcastle, and his running metres proved crucial in that decision, reports The Times. It is an area of growth the club are targeting and that approach is led by the summer recruit Mike Sansoni who joined the club as director of data after spending 11 years with the Mercedes Formula 1 team.",
      "Sansoni works closely with Wilcox and is leading a push at United which will see them become a “fully data-driven club which will lead to success on and off the pitch”. He has access to data models capable of listing the data of tens of thousands of players.",
      "The cub believe they are among the leaders in that field, which ultimately led to the signing of Sesko. The jury is still out on the ex-RB Leipzig frontman but those concerns are not shared by those in Manchester.",
      "He has only scored twice for the club. Gyokeres has copped similar criticism after a slow start that has seen him scored four times. But Amorim and co are satisfied with his movement off the ball and his attitude during the week is that of a player determined to make his mark.",
      "Sesko, as well as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, all showed a willingness to join the Manchester outfit, which was seen as another big plus. Sesko could've headed to St James' Park with Newcastle also keen on Mbeumo, who had another offer from Tottenham.",
      "Amorim accepts that Sesko will be concerned with his form, but he's confident in the striker. He said: \"I'm relaxed, he's not relaxed. I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle. That is normal. He has no experience here.\"",
      "\"Ben is a young kid, a control freak. He wants to control everything - and he's not going to control everything. He has more potential than I was thinking [but] we need to understand how he likes to play and also to put in our ideas.",
      "\"I'm quite relaxed with that. He is going to be our striker for the long term but he's going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride. That is a normal thing in football.\"",

      "Manchester United legends Gordon Strachan and Wes Brown remain convinced the club made the correct decision in allowing Marcus Rashford to leave despite his impressive form at Barcelona. Some supporters might understandably feel a pang of regret after watching the forward flourish in Catalonia.",
      "The 28-year-old has contributed to 15 goals in his opening 16 appearances for Barca, reminding the Old Trafford faithful of his capabilities. Furthermore, the reported £28million permanent transfer fee the Blaugrana would need to pay is looking like increasingly excellent value on their part.",
      "However, while certain United supporters may sense they're losing out, both Strachan and Brown maintain the club acted wisely in sanctioning the loan move. The duo pointed to Rashford's recent displays for Thomas Tuchel's England as additional evidence supporting their stance.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford was very good for England last week, but I maintain that Manchester United were right to part way with him,\" Strachan told Esports News. \"The time was right for both parties to move on, and it's been proven to have been the right decision.",
      "\"Rashford was struggling at United, and it seemed as if he didn't have Ruben Amorim's full confidence; he wasn't getting a lot of game time, but in the minutes that he did play, I think it's fair to say he didn't prove the doubters wrong.",
      "\"I'm glad to see him finding success at Barcelona. Everyone has said all along that he's a talented player - that's never been in doubt. The move has benefitted his career and also allowed United to move forward, rather than be stuck with a dilemma in the dressing room.\"",
      "Rashford spent the latter half of last campaign on loan at Aston Villa, where he rediscovered his spark after struggling under United manager Amorim. Before that, the club took disciplinary action against him in January 2024 following his absence from training after a night out drinking in Belfast.",
      "A fresh start seems to have done wonders for Rashford, who now resembles the player United once envisaged he'd become. And Brown reckons both sides can feel satisfied with how matters have unfolded.",
      "Speaking to BetWright casino, he said: \"Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He'd been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple.",
      "\"He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don't blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn't in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn't working.\"",
      "The Treble-winning defender has thrown his weight behind Rashford, predicting he'll have \"a great World Cup\" next year. After England topped their group with a flawless record, Rashford ended the campaign by setting up Harry Kane in a 2-0 victory over Albania.",

      "Ex-Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood has been praised by French journalists following his stellar display for Marseille against Nice in Ligue 1. Greenwood netted twice in a 5-1 victory on Friday evening.",
      "His goals take his tally to nine and 10 league strikes respectively this campaign - putting him at the summit of the Ligue 1 Golden Boot standings. Ahead of the game he also took part in a rare interview.",
      "La Parisien led with the headline: \"Thanks to a brace from Greenwood, the Olympians sink the Aiglons and take over as leaders\" whilst heaping acclaim on the 24-year-old.",
      "They wrote: \"The Englishman then scored Marseille's second goal himself with a right-footed shot deflected by Bard, who endured a very difficult first 45 minutes.\"",
      "The publication continued: \"The Dutch goalkeeper thwarted Terem Moffi, allowing Greenwood to finally seal the victory... the Englishman was ruthless: in the 53rd minute, he left Juma Bah for dead with a feint and a burst of speed before beating Yehvann Diouf with a perfectly placed, low, right-footed shot across goal (3-0).\"",
      "Elsewhere, GET Football awarded Greenwood an eight out of 10 in their match ratings. They said: \"The Englishman provided a brace to become top scorer in the league with ten strikes.",
      "\"Whilst he had a quiet opening period, the former Manchester United man sprung into life when he found several pockets of space down the right side – especially on the counter attack.\"",
      "They added: \"His first goal was a deflected strike off Vanhoutte, but he was well-positioned to receive the ball and drive into the dangerous area on the left side. His second strike of the evening was more impressive: Leo Balerdi released him on the edge of the box, and Greenwood shifted his body well before releasing a low strike past Diouf.\"",
      "Greenwood gave an interview before the match against Nice. Quizzed about his abilities and pressed on what he considers his finest move on the pitch, Greenwood responded: \"The stepover.\"",
      "Brazilian legend Ronaldo was then brought up by the interviewer, with Greenwood revealing: \"I watched a lot of him when I was younger, he used to do it on the goalkeepers a lot, which is kind of crazy.\"",
      "In another section of the conversation, Greenwood revealed a method he employs to remain composed when facing scoring chances.",
      "\"The night before a game, I'm in bed and you're just visualising things in your head, moments on the pitch,\" he said. \"And when I go out to warm up on the pitch, I like to visualise, maybe if I'm in certain situations I'll do this or do that, so when it comes to it it's second nature really, I can just do it straight away.\"",
      "Discussing his ability to use either foot, Greenwood explained: \"When you've got both feet, the defender sometimes likes to show you one way on to your weaker side or on to another side.",
      "\"Which I like, because if he's showing me or wants to push me, I'll take the opportunity because I can shoot on the right side. Or if he wants to show me to the left, I can take the opportunity on the left.\"",
      "Since his move from United in the summer of 2024, Greenwood has been a standout performer for the French outfit. The Red Devils pocketed a cool £26.7million from the transfer, and cleverly included a sell-on clause that entitles them to half of any future fee Marseille receive for the player.",

      "Manchester United's Marcus Rashford has finally swapped his plush Barcelona hotel for a swanky new neighbourhood. The area was previously home to Barca greats Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique.",
      "The England forward initially took up residence in the luxurious Hotel Torre Melina following his temporary move to Spain from Manchester United over the summer. The hotel's prime location proved ideal for the 28-year-old given it's only a mile away from Camp Nou, where Rashford will play for the first time this weekend.",
      "However, after four months, Rashford has traded the opulent 391-room hotel for an apartment in Esplugues, a municipality on the outskirts of Barcelona nestled against the Collserola mountains.",
      "Esplugues, once home to Barcelona greats like Iniesta and Pique, will now be Rashford's base at least until next summer when his season-long loan expires. The Manchester-born striker seems to have settled well into his new surroundings, taking up local activities such as padel and fishing.",
      "While at the hotel, Rashford had access to top-notch facilities including a spa sanctuary and a fully-equipped fitness centre. The hotel also offered the privacy that Rashford, given his global fame, would undoubtedly appreciate, complete with a private helipad for air travel.",
      "In his new neighbourhood, he could potentially be joined by Barcelona team-mate Lamine Yamal. Spanish sources suggest that the young footballer had been eyeing up the mansion previously owned by Pique and his ex-wife Shakira.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reportedly raking in a whopping £325,000 per week after signing his new long-term contract this past summer, Yamal was said to be considering snapping up the property valued at £9.5million.",
      "Originally on the market for £12m three years ago, the price of the mansion has since been slashed. The sprawling 3,800 square foot estate boasts three separate houses, with the main residence featuring a tennis court and both an indoor and outdoor swimming pool.",
      "Just a few months into his Barcelona stint and Rashford is already making waves in Spain. Currently ranking as the fifth-most prolific player in Europe this season in terms of goal involvements, he's already netted six goals and provided nine assists in just 16 matches.",
      "Not only has no player in Europe's five major leagues managed to surpass Rashford's nine assists this season, but no La Liga player has outdone the Englishman's tally of four goals and two assists in the Champions League.",

The Spanish press have warmly welcomed the 28-year-old striker, praising not only his on-pitch contributions but also how seamlessly he's settled into life in Catalonia.",
      "Rashford's modest approach away from football is drawing comparisons with Barca sensation Lamine Yamal, who has been in the spotlight over his off-field conduct.",
      "The England international has netted six goals and provided nine assists since his summer switch to the Catalan club. Following his move to Spain, the striker has refocused his priorities, delivering a string of eye-catching displays.",
      "Away from the spotlight, Rashford is understood to have left the centrally-located Hotel Torre Melina, situated a mile from the stadium. He's now settled into a flat in Esplugues, nestled beside the Collserola mountains.",
      "Sources indicate he enjoys playing padel and fishing during his downtime. One of the forward's preferred dining spots is reportedly La Cupula Garraf, a restaurant boasting spectacular coastal views.",

      "The same cannot be said for the 18-year-old Lamine. The Barcelona wonderkid has attracted negative attention for multiple incidents in his private life this year alone.",
      "Most significantly, Lamine encountered fierce criticism after throwing a private celebration over the summer for his birthday. The Spanish authorities were reported to have called for an inquiry into the event at the time, which featured guests with dwarfism and women in revealing outfits.",
      "Spanish publication Marca reported that Jesus Martin, the General Director of Disability in the government, urged ministers to launch an investigation.",
      "The Association of People with Achondroplasia and other Skeletal Dysplasias in Spain (ADEE) also condemned Yamal's choice to employ people with dwarfism for entertainment purposes.",
      "The Spain international has already been absent for several matches this season, yet he's still managed to net three goals and register five assists in eight appearances across all competitions. His private affairs have become somewhat of a distraction though.",
      "He has made headlines for his romance with Argentine rapper Nicki Nicole, 25, owing to the couple's notable age difference.",
      "Yamal has since confirmed that he's no longer in a relationship with the musician. However, he had also been romantically connected with a 30-year-old influencer, before his relationship with Nicole.",
      "Rashford, meanwhile, appears to be embracing his new life. Speaking to ESPN on if he wanted to stay at Barcelona and make his move permanent, he said: \"Oh yeah, for sure.\"",

      "Plenty of mistakes have been made since Ineos took control of football operations at Manchester United. Often the communication with supporters has been poor and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's treatment of fans when it comes to ticket prices and other matters has been rightly criticised.",
      "However, one area that has improved has been the recruiting and selling of players. Of course, not every piece of business will be universally welcomed but at least there seems to be a method which United are looking to implement in the transfer market.",
      "Sporting director Jason Wilcox explained this on a recent episode of the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"Last year’s summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one. This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "\"These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath. We are very clear on the profiles that we need. The brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris.",
      "\"[There is] a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need and then the scouts will go into the market. We combine that with the data team and there will be constant dialogue. Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team of the profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable with Ruben as well. It is a really joined up approach.\"",
      "This is a world away from the recruitment plan under Erik ten Hag. At times it seemed as though he was solely responsible for identifying possible targets.",
      "While some of his ex-players have proven to be decent buys - Lisandro Martinez started well and Matthijs de Ligt is getting better every week - many others fell short of the required standard. But if Wilcox is true to his word and the manager still has a say in recruitment, the board need to listen to what Amorim had to say this week.",
      "Amorim was asked why his team's level was dropping off in the second half of matches. In response, the Portuguese head coach highlighted two players' absences - two players who could no longer be with the Reds at the start of next season.",
      "He said: \"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players. Not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.\"",
      "The United duo are both out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, neither man will be staying beyond then. Casemiro has stated he wishes to continue playing football beyond this campaign. Despite United having an option to extend his contract by a further 12 months, the Reds would rather negotiate a new deal to lower his salary.",
      "United have already used the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months and so a new deal would need to be struck. United will likely want to lower his wages to reflect the amount of playing time he will have beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire seems the most likely to stay at present but if one, or both, of these players leave Old Trafford in 2026, United have a job on their hands to replace them. Amorim knows neither man is the future of United but what they both have shown is that the team looks weaker when they are not on the pitch.",
      "This should have alarm bells ringing inside Old Trafford. Replacing players with such Premier League and European experience will be a difficult task and this interview alone has ensured the issue has been flagged early.",
      "If both end up leaving, United will need to replace them with quality, experienced players. If they are not able to, they risk losing key squad depth for 2026/27.",

      "Few new signings at Manchester United have had the same immediate impact as Bryan Mbeumo in recent history. Brentford's talisman arrived at Old Trafford keen to pick up where he left off and has managed to do just that with six goals in 12 appearances.",
      "After the brace against Brighton and Hove Albion, Mbeumo refused to limit himself to a target of 20 goals which he achieved last season and who could blame him? He has hit the ground running and the sky should be the limit for the 26-year-old.",
      "However, what could temper his momentum is the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). This winter, Mbeumo will join up with his Cameroon teammates for the continental competition. AFCON has proven to be a problem for Premier League clubs for many years now. While no manager wants to stand in the way of their player representing their nation on the biggest stage, the timing of the tournament means it will impact domestic clubs, particularly United who will not only lose Mbeumo but also Amad and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "That is why Ruben Amorim spoke about his desire to keep Mbeumo and Co for longer than the usual cut off period. He said: \"We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see.",
      "\"We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.",
      "\"I think it is two weeks before the start [they have to leave]. So, we will try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "Ultimately Amorim is right. The issue is firmly out of his hands considering Cameroon and the other federations hold all the cards. Thankfully for Amorim, Cameroon have already shown they are willing to grant his wish. Ahead of the last AFCON, Erik ten Hag managed to delay Andre Onana's exit to the tournament until the day before it began.",
      "This meant Onana only missed the victory over Newport County in the FA Cup and was able to retain his place in the Premier League upon his return. Onana was expected with his national team two weeks before the tournament.",
      "But Cameroon were willing to be flexible although their reasoning will be a warning to the Reds. It is believed the African nation were understanding because Onana had retired from international football when he was initially signed by United.",
      "The keeper reversed his decision as Onana's relationship with the Cameroon federation was repaired and, as such, United's request was granted as they pitied the predicament Ten Hag found himself in. This is not the same for Mbeumo. Whatever happens, Mbeumo will be missed for however games he is absent.",

      "Nobody would have believed this statement at the start of the season, but Luke Shaw can be classed as one of the best players of the season so for Manchester United. Ignoring the Manchester City defeat, where nobody covered themselves in glory, Shaw has been a dependable option for Ruben Amorim.",
      "His reliability has been missing in recent years. In the 2024/25 season, he missed 294 days due to three injuries. The season prior it was 239 days and there were question marks over whether he would stay fit long enough to contribute to the cause.",
      "And yet, his redemption arc has been spectacular in the 2025/26 campaign. He has started every single Premier League fixture for Amorim and is settled on the left of the back three in Lisandro Martinez's absence.",
      "None of this could have been expected at the end of last season but it is a credit to the medical team and Shaw that he has managed to become a regular again. However, this could all unravel if Amorim goes with the idea he floated in his pre-Everton press conference when asked whether Shaw could play at left wing-back.",
      "\"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\" In a way, you can see why Amorim would come to that conclusion.",
      "Naturally, Shaw is a full-back but he has suffered a lot of injuries since last playing on the flank. He has had to adapt his style of play and is impressing in the less physically demanding role of left centre-back.",
      "Amorim said it himself in his press conference, the load a player at wing-back has to take on is much more than what he is doing now and would stretch Shaw's body to the maximum, increasing the chances of an injury.",
      "Even if United were confident Shaw has overcome past issues, now is not the time to trial him at wing back. United are about to enter their busiest period of the campaign and it would be asking for trouble to shift Shaw out wide.",

      "“Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised,\" said Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber about Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek last month. \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "The general rule with United loans is that they send players with a genuine chance of contributing to the first team at Old Trafford on loan to the Championship. Vitek and Toby Collyer are currently playing in the division. Alvaro Fernandez and Amad were success stories at Preston and Sunderland respectively.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving 46-game campaign, and young players must demonstrate resilience and quality to be successful in the division.",
      "Vitek has shown a lot of quality since he signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan. The goalkeeper has started every league game, kept five clean sheets and has won huge praise from their fans.",
      "He made the perfect first impression after signing on loan, saving a penalty in Bristol City's final pre-season game, and has not looked back.",
      "\"Of course, signing a player from Manchester United always brings with it a sense of excitement, but the 22-year-old was certainly an unknown quantity when he arrived.",
      "\"A penalty save and clean sheet in his first, and only, friendly for the Robins against Real Valladolid impressed those in attendance, and Vitek has only improved from that point on.",
      "\"His opening day display away to Sheffield United was superb as he commanded his penalty area brilliantly and pulled off a handful of smart stops from a variety of different scenarios.",
      "\"While you would expect a young goalkeeper to potentially be a bit of a rabbit in the headlights in what is an incredibly physical Championship this season, Vitek has looked like a veteran stopper in England’s second tier.\"",
      "He continued: \"Barring one uncharacteristic error in the 5-1 defeat to Stoke City, Vitek has been brilliant. It isn’t an exaggeration to suggest he has single-handedly won points on several occasions.",
      "\"He has produced multiple match-deciding stops at crucial points of matches. Vitek has kept five clean sheets over the course of his first 15 matches in red and white, and you could argue he deserves more.",
      "\"Against the likes of Charlton, Norwich City, Birmingham City and Hull City, it was his work between the posts as much as that of the attackers at the other end of the pitch that proved to be the difference, with his showing against the Addicks in particular a real standout.",
      "\"The fans have taken to him, as displayed by his interactions with away ends. The fact that he has kept Max O’Leary out of the team - the goalkeeper who played all 46 matches last season as the Reds ended their 17-year wait for a top six finish - speaks volumes to just how impressed Struber has been so far.\"",
      "Vitek cut his teeth on loan with Accrington Stanley in the second half of 2023/24. He joined the League Two club in the winter window and made 18 starts in the league, helping to guide them to safety.",
      "When Vitek reported for pre-season at Carrington after that loan, he started in a United friendly against Rosenborg in Norway and delivered a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's really good for youngsters to get the opportunity, but when you step on the field you have to show yourself because it's a big chance in front of a lot of people.\"",
      "When asked about what it was like to represent United in pre-season, Vitek smiled and added: \"It's an amazing feeling, the fans are absolutely amazing and it was a full stadium of red shirts.\"",
      "Vitek was named in the 29-man travelling squad for the United States tour, but he was sent on a season-long loan to Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz after returning to Manchester.",
      "During his unveiling, FC Blau-Weiß Linz's sporting director said: \"With Radek, we are getting a very talented young goalkeeper who has already gained a lot of experience in England and is, among other things, part of the goalkeeping team of Manchester United's first team.\"",
      "Vitek started almost every league game for FC Blau-Weiß Linz, only missing three matches due to an injury. His loan was a resounding success and FC Blau-Weiß Linz wanted to re-sign him on loan this summer.",
      "Speaking in June, United academy goalkeeper coach Tommy Lee said: “Radek has done great in Austria. He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well.",
      "\"He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers. He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional.",
      "\"That is going to take him, I believe, to the top level. He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He’s 6ft 6ins, which always helps. For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Bristol City was chosen as the best destination for Vitek to take the next step in his career, and he signed a new contract with United, expiring in 2028, before moving south to Ashton Gate for this season.",
      "Carter explained: \"United fans will have likely seen the clip of the ridiculous save Radek Vitek made to deny Oli McBurnie from close range in City’s win over Hull City back in October.",
      "\"He got down well to claw a low header off the line and away from danger, a stop you wouldn’t imagine someone his size could make, and it was just one of multiple key saves in that contest.",
      "\"His intervention to deny Norwich City’s Jack Stacey at Carrow Road may have been even better, however. Stacey had peeled into space in the centre of the penalty area and wrapped his foot around a cut-back to fire a shot towards the bottom right corner.",
      "\"Despite having an obscured view, Vitek took off to his left and got down well to not only get a big hand on the bouncing shot but also push it into the path of Neto Borges, who could hack clear.",
      "\"Struber said after that win at Carrow Road that even he was surprised at times by just what Vitek was capable of. I am probably forgetting other impressive saves, but the fact that there are quite so many to pick from is a testament to just how good Vitek has been during his loan.\"",
      "Discussing Vitek's strengths and weaknesses, Carter said: \"He is a really good shot-stopper. Whether it be when reacting to close-range efforts or when dealing with looping shots from range, he seems to have the answer more often than not.",
      "\"If you were to look back at the goals he has conceded so far this season, you’d do well to suggest he could have done much better with all but a handful of them.",
      "\"When it comes to commanding his box, he uses every inch of his frame to deal well with high balls, whether that be from open play or set-pieces. It has been clear this season just how much more comfortable Bristol City have been when defending corners, and a large part of that has been their goalkeeper’s willingness to leave his line and deal with looping balls.",
      "\"It is challenging to identify a major weakness, but I think you could make a compelling argument that distribution is Vitek’s primary area for improvement.",
      "\"He can kick the ball further than most goalkeepers I’ve seen at Ashton Gate, and he has pulled off a couple of smart - if concerning - Cruyff turns, but he has probably kicked goal kicks into touch a bit too often. He is by no means terrible with the ball at his feet, but he could be a bit more polished.\"",
      "When asked whether Vitek could play in the Premier League, he added: \"Absolutely. Bristol City have signed several players on loan from Premier League clubs over the years, and although it is still early days, Radek Vitek has been one of the most impressive.",
      "\"Vitek has been one of the division’s best shot stoppers and he is excellent when it comes to commanding his box. Naturally, given his age and lack of top-flight experience, he has room to improve, but you would struggle to find a Bristol City fan who wasn’t confident that Vitek will play in the Premier League.",
      "\"Of course, it will depend on what Manchester United plan to do with him come the end of his time at Ashton Gate, but I would imagine his performances will have caught the eye of some Premier League sides.",
      "\"Whether it be at Old Trafford, another club, or hopefully, in another loan spell with the Robins after helping them win promotion this term, I’d expect Vitek to be playing top-flight football next season.\"",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing. The first game away from home... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget it.\"",
      "He went on to discuss his hopes of playing for United. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek has huge potential and could challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot next season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United's live blog on Sunday, November 23.",
      "With the January transfer window rapidly approaching, clubs are preparing to make moves - whether that means offloading players or bringing in reinforcements. As always, United have been linked with several names, though it remains to be seen if any deals will actually go through.",
      "One player regularly mentioned is Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, whose release clause becomes active in the New Year. United, however, face competition from other Premier League sides.",
      "The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) could also play a role in shaping transfer plans, with players such as Amad Diallo set to be away on international duty. How United respond to these challenges will be worth keeping an eye on in the weeks ahead.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and transfer rumours involving Man Utd below.",
      "Manchester United are adopting a similar strategy to Harry Maguire's contract extension while negotiating fresh terms with midfielder Casemiro, according to the latest reports.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, journalist Fabrizio Romano provided an update on the midfielder's future at Old Trafford with his contract ticking towards an end.",
      "While there is an acknowledgement he has been crucial to the team's resurgence this season, the financial aspects of a new deal currently present a stumbling block.",
      "\"Guys, my understanding is that the situation of Casemiro is a really similar situation in terms of strategy to Harry Maguire,\" Romano explained.",
      "“Casemiro and Maguire are out of contract in summer 2026. And for Manchester United, they are two really important players.",
      "“Especially now Casemiro, we have to say congrats to Casemiro in this video because he’s been able to change his situation at Manchester United.",
      "“So now the desire is from United obviously to continue with Casemiro but on different conditions. The salary he has right now is a salary that Manchester United don’t want to pay in the future.",
      "\"Not because of Casemiro or Maguire but because they want to change the salary structure. So at the moment for Casemiro eventually the only way to stay would be a different contract, a different salary.",
      "\"Otherwise he could be free next summer to go wherever he wants. He always had a lot of interest especially from Saudi Arabia.",
      "“So after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested. But at the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing guaranteed in terms of new contract because of the salary.",
      "“They need to find a solution on the salary structure together club and player, they have to try to find common ground on this point otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Manchester United in summer 2026.\"",
      "Few new signings at Manchester United have had the same immediate impact as Bryan Mbeumo in recent history, writes Jack Flintham.",
      "Brentford's talisman arrived at Old Trafford keen to pick up where he left off and has managed to do just that with six goals in 12 appearances. He has hit the ground running and the sky should be the limit for the 26-year-old.",
      "However, what could temper his momentum is the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). This winter, Mbeumo will join up with his Cameroon teammates for the continental competition and AFCON has proven to be a problem for Premier League clubs for many years now.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "New Wolves manager Rob Edwards has said that he is 'not aware' of any approaches for midfielder Joao Gomes.",
      "United have been linked with an interest in the Wolves man ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "\"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised,\" he said ahead of this weekend's games.",
      "“We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "Another game in the Premier League has just finished, with league leaders Arsenal coming out on top in the North London Derby.",
      "Goals from Leandro Trossard and Eberechi Eze (x2) put Arsenal 3-0 up.",
      "Richarlison got a goal back for Spurs to make it 3-1.",
      "But Eze grabbed his hat-trick to make the full-time score 4-1 to Arsenal.",
      "Everton boss David Moyes has spoken about a possible move for former Manchester United man Scott Mctominay.",
      "The forward has impressed with Napoli since leaving Old Trafford, with Everton one of the clubs linked with an interest.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, ahead of tomorrow night's clash with United, Moyes said:",
      "“If you’re using the word £60m and those sort of numbers, I don’t know if we’re quite at that level yet…”",
      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has given a fresh update on his fitness after he missed out on playing for Barcelona at the newly refurbished Camp Nou. The 68-cap England player has impressed for the Catalan giants ever since he made the move in the summer transfer window.",
      "The 28-year-old has scored six goals and assisted nine so far this season over 16 appearances in all competitions, settling in well to a new league - and environment. Rashford's momentum was halted somewhat on his return to the club this weekend, however, due to a fresh illness he picked up.",

      "Manchester United's on loan winger Jadon Sancho has been told that he will have to take a big wage cut if he wishes to return to Borussia Dortmund for a third time.",
      "Sancho is currently on loan with Aston Villa, but is struggling for regular game time.",
      "He has been linked with a third spell with Dortmund, but the Mirror report that he will have to half his £300,000 per-week wage if he is to make the move.",
      "Manchester United have been dealt a potential blow in their hopes of signing Borussia Dortmund's Karim Adeyemi in January, according to latest reports.",

      "Dortmund are said to be demanding a £75m fee should they sell in January.",
      "With no United until tomorrow, it gives fans a chance to keep an eye on other games going on over the weekend.",

      "Although several other elite clubs across Europe are interested, United are now the 'primary candidate' to recruit the defender and are working on an agreement to offer guaranteed minutes and a clear career path.",
      "Adam Wharton is in line to become Manchester United's top midfield target if Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is unattainable, according to TEAMTalk.",
      "Crystal Palace star Wharton is among three midfielders that United are looking at, with Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba the other two. But, with Forest demanding more than £100million for Anderson and Baleba's form dropping, Wharton could become the most appealable.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on this fine Sunday morning.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest news and rumours throughout the day...",
      "Conor Gallagher has admitted he wants a bigger role at Atletico Madrid after being linked with a move to Manchester United. United’s well known frailties in central midfield have understandably led to the club looking at potential options in the transfer market.",
      "One of the players they were linked with in the summer was the 25-year-old England international, although a move failed to materialise as Atletico were only prepared to sanction a permanent sale.",
      "Gallagher, who was sold by boyhood club Chelsea to the La Liga side in the summer of 2024 for a fee of £34million, made 50 appearances in Spain in his first season. And while he has continued to feature in every game, his minutes have been mainly limited to appearances off the bench.",
      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches. United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago. Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight. As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "Crystal Palace and Jean-Philippe Mateta have held talks over a contract extension at Selhurst Park. The France international was one of the names linked with a potential switch to Old Trafford in the summer, prior to Benjamin Sesko's £74m transfer.",
      "United, who were said to be in talks with Mateta's representatives earlier this year, recently suffered an injury blow with Sesko ruled out for several weeks. Despite the short-term nature of the Slovenian's injury, Amorim is said to be interested in bringing in an additional striker.",
      "That could see United return for the 28-year-old Mateta, who has 18 months left on his deal in south London. It was previously reported that the Eagles were looking for a bid in the region of £40m to part ways with their striker, who has scored 16 and 14 goals in each of the previous two seasons.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire have been ruled out of Manchester United's game against Everton due to injury, but Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo could return to the squad.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Read more here",
      "Matheus Cunha has suffered an accident in Manchester United training, it is claimed.",
      "On Saturday, the Brazilian was due to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham, but in a statement on Instagram, VisitAltrincham have claimed that the player suffered an “accident” in training on Saturday, and could no longer attend for “medical reasons”.",
      "A post shared by Visit Altrincham (@visitaltrincham)",
      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko was not seen taking part in the training session held prior to the clash with Everton on Monday night. The Slovenian hobbled off the pitch against Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, leaving the Reds with just ten men for the remainder of the game.",
      "The forward went straight down the tunnel and Ruben Amorim hinted he may have to delve into the transfer market if his injury is a long-term issue. Whether that is the case or not remains to be seen but Sesko was not seen taking part in training on Friday morning. Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo were also not seen in the training session.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United do not meet a traditional big-six side across their next 10 Premier League matches in a huge boost to Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds will be feeling much better about themselves after a poor start to the campaign - which had seen head coach Amorim come under increasing pressure. United are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, though, and sit seventh in the top-flight table after 11 games.",
      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have been told they won't be signing Elliot Anderson this winter - but Conor Gallagher could still be an option.",
      "Alex Crook told talkSPORT: “It’s not going to happen in January. I’d be surprised if United do much in January, maybe Conor Gallagher on loan, if he’s available, is a possibility. And Conor, to try and force his way back into the England squad might be up for that.",
      "“It’s a big jump, isn’t it, for Elliot Anderson? Bearing in mind they paid [Newcastle United] £35m for him. Is he a £100m player? I think he’s a really good player, not sure he’s quite worth that much.”",
      "Manchester United are scouting two players from the same club who attracted interest from Arsenal over the summer.",
      "French journalist Francois Rausy reported, via TeamTalk, that during a Rennes game he spoke to United scout Steve Head, who confirmed he was there to watch Jeremy Jacquet and Mohamed Kadar Meite.",
      "Arsenal were heavily linked with Jacquet during the summer window but ultimately Mikel Arteta’s side opted to sign Cristhian Mosquera instead.",
      "Barcelona have released a statement regarding Marcus Rashford's absence from their match againt Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The statement read: \"Marcus Rashford will miss today’s match against Athletic Club due to flu\".",
      "This alleivates any concern that the Manchester United loanee had suffered an injury as this would have impacted Barca's efforts to permanently sign Rashford."

      "Former Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has issued the perfect response to ex-teammate Paul Pogba's emotional statement. That's following the midfielder's long-awaited comeback to football.",
      "Pogba, 32, has had two spells with United throughout his career, initially as a youth prospect before he re-joined the club in 2016 from Juventus for a then world-record fee. Rashford, meanwhile, is a product of United's academy - although he's currently out on loan with La Liga giants Barcelona.",
      "Pogba departed Old Trafford for the final time in 2022 following the expiration of his contract and returned to Juventus as a free agent. However, in his second season back in Turin, he was hit with a shock doping ban.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year suspension from football back in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result stemming from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His suspension was eventually reduced - and he was cleared to return to football in March this year. He became a free agent when his contract with Juventus was mutually terminated at the end of 2024, and he joined Ligue 1 side AS Monaco in June.",
      "Pogba has been forced to wait to return to the pitch, however, due to the need to rebuild fitness. He finally made his debut this weekend as he came on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 defeat away at Rennes.",
      "Speaking on Instagram on Sunday, Pogba said: \"Last night was unforgettable. Stepping back on to the pitch after two years away meant more to me than I can express.",
      "\"To the fans, thank you for the love, the energy, and the belief. To everyone who stood behind me, supported me, and pushed me through every moment of this journey, I'm deeply grateful.",
      "\"This debut wasn't just mine... it belonged to all of you who never stopped supporting me.\"",
      "A handful of his former United teammates have showed their support in the comments of the post. Rashford was among them, leaving a simple red heart emoji.",
      "Current United captain Bruno Fernandes also echoed the sentiment - from his previous Instagram story - with the comment \"Pogback,\" while Jesse Lingard replied: \"The boy'ss back.\"",
      "Pogba came on as a late substitute in the 85th-minute, although the match was all but lost for Monaco at that stage as they trailed 4-0, with a late consolation making it 4-1 in added time.

      "Members of the Manchester United squad have made their feelings on Paul Pogba clear after the midfielder made his long-awaited return to the pitch on Saturday evening.",
      "The 32-year-old spent several years at United across two spells, having initially joined the club aged 16. He departed for Juventus as a free agent in 2012, but returned for a then world-record fee in 2016.",
      "He amassed over 230 appearances across all competitions during that time - scoring 39 goals and registering 51 assists. Pogba then rejoined Juventus in 2022 at the end of his contract, but made his last competitive outing for the Serie A club in September 2023.",
      "The Frenchman was handed a provisional four-year ban from football in February 2024 after testing positive for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a result that came from a sample taken the previous August. Pogba has always insisted it was a mistake and he had been given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.",
      "His ban was eventually reduced and he was permitted to return to football in March this year. He was without a club after his contract with Juventus was terminated by mutual agreement towards the end of 2024.",
      "Pogba returned to France to join Ligue 1 side Monaco on a free transfer in June, but had to wait to make his debut as he needed to rebuild his fitness after such a long absence. On Saturday, he came off the bench in their 4-1 defeat to Rennes, marking his first appearance in more than two years.",
      "Members of the current United squad, including captain Bruno Fernandes, took to social media to congratulate Pogba on his return. The Portuguese playmaker shared a post on his Instagram story of Pogba - followed by the caption: \"Pogbaaaaaack.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford during the summer transfer window just gone, also posted on Instagram. He re-shared a clip from Monaco's official account showing Pogba coming on as a substitute, followed by a holding-back-tears emoji and heart emojis.",
      "It was not the exact return Pogba would have wanted as his side succumbed to a 4-1 loss, although they were already four behind and a man down when he took to the pitch - in the 85th minute. The result leaves Monaco eighth in the Ligue 1 standings, level on points with Lille, who have a game-in-hand.",
      "With minutes now under his belt, Pogba will no doubt hope to play a role in some huge games coming up for the French side over the next week. They first meet Pafos away in the Champions League on Wednesday night, which will be followed by the visit of Paris Saint-Germain next weekend.",
      "United, meanwhile, return to action on Monday night with a test against Everton in the Premier League. Next weekend, they will take on Crystal Palace away from home.",

      "Chelsea are set to finish in fourth place - with 66.2 expected points. The Club World Cup champions are closely followed by United in fifth, which could be enough to clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",

      "The data - and results, of course - suggest the Portuguese tactician is making good progress at Old Trafford. After a year in charge, Amorim is pleased with what he's seeing.",
      "\"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games,\" said the United boss. \"We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "On the race for European football, Amorim added: \"In our league, the table doesn't matter because everything is so tight that it is irrelevant. If you know the history of our team you never know when it is a difficult game.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been left sweating this weekend over the fitness of Matheus Cunha ahead of the Premier League return vs Everton on Monday night. On Friday, the Portuguese head coach confirmed Benjamin Sesko would miss the next few weeks due to a knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham.",
      "However, a statement from an unlikely source has subsequently cast doubt over the fitness of Cunha. On Saturday evening, the Brazilian was due to switch the Christmas lights on in Altrincham but the organisers announced the forward had been forced to pull out.",
      "In a statement, VisitAltrincham confirmed: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "So far, there has been no indication from United as to how bad the issue is. If Cunha is to miss the Reds' clash with Everton on Monday night, this leaves Amorim with plenty to think about in regards his team selection. Missing two players who the United boss has tended to favour in attack could lead to an interesting forward line.",
      "From new roles to a fringe player returning to the fore, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could line-up if Cunha is missing on Monday night against Everton and beyond.",
      "United were always likely to deploy the false nine system on Monday night due to Sesko's absence. Ordinarily in the strikerless formation, Cunha would sit at the top of the attack but if he is not fit, that role could be given to Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Playing as a centre-forward is a position which Mbeumo knows fairly well from his time at Brentford. In his last four appearances leading the attack for the Bees in the Premier League, he scored four goals so he clearly knows how to play the role.",
      "If the Reds were to start Mbeumo in the advanced role, Mason Mount and Amad are the ones most likely to feature behind him. Mount did well in his cameo role at Spurs and while the Ivorian has become more dangerous in the wider role, he can still impact the game positively from the No.10 position.",
      "There is a consensus that Joshua Zirkzee's time at Old Trafford is coming to an end. The Dutchman has played just 90 minutes over five sub appearances for the Reds and we can expect Zirkzee to request an exit in January as he launches a last gasp bid for a World Cup spot.",
      "Earlier this week, when it became clear Sesko would be out, there was a feeling Zirkzee was about to discover his position at the club. Amorim favours a centre forward unless facing a team who are more likely to attack than sit back; so to choose the strikerless system would be to confirm the Dutchman is not in his plans.",
      "Now Cunha could be out too and should Zirkzee be overlooked it would only further confirm his slipping position at Old Trafford. Were he to return, we could expect him to lead the line with Mbeumo and Amad in behind. On paper, this would be a good option but evidence suggests this will not be the route Amorim takes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo missed Friday's training session but Amorim was hopeful he could return to play a role vs Everton. Mainoo's role so far this season has been from the bench but with Cunha potentially absent he could be recalled.",
      "Slotting in alongside Casemiro, Mainoo would then allow Bruno Fernandes to move further forward. It is clear the captain would prefer to play more advanced if the choice was given to him.",
      "Alongside Amad, you could then keep Mbeumo in the false nine position. This would provide United with a strong attacking threat and plenty of creativity in the final third.",

      "Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Rob Edwards insists there has been no formal interest in Joao Gomes amid Manchester United's links to the midfielder. Gomes has emerged as a potential target for the Reds as they prepare to overhaul the midfield in the summer transfer window.",
      "Casemiro, who has excelled in midfield this season, is set to leave the club should a new contract not be agreed. United do hold an option to extend his stay by a further 12 months but the MEN understands the Reds would rather make an effort to lower his salary than to roll it on.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been linked with United but both players are valued at around £100m. Gomes though would be considerably less, especially if Wolves are relegated from the Premier League this season. The West Midlands club recently appointed Edwards as their new manager.",
      "Before his first game in charge of the club against Palace, Edwards was asked about the possibility of Gomes leaving Molineux either in January or the summer transfer window. He said: \"We’ve spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised. We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I’m not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "Wolves went on to lose 2-0 in Edwards' first match and should this form continue, Gomes will be looking to leave to maintain his status as a Premier League player. Should United be the ones to win the race for Gomes, the Brazilian's arrival would be welcomed by Matheus Cunha. Speaking previously about his former teammate, Cunha insisted Gomes had the potential to be as good as Casemiro.",
      "He said: \"He is a bit older now but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",

      "Manchester United are heading towards a crucial period of the season following the final international break of 2025. The festive period is often when the table starts to take shape and while the top end is congested now, it probably won't be once the festive fixtures have been played.",
      "United will hope by January they are still in the mix for the European qualification spots as a bare minimum. However, the target will be a spot in the Champions League next season and with no other distractions before January, it is a good time for the Reds to push on.",
      "What we also expect to find out by January is the future of Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman is understood to be preparing to request an exit from Old Trafford this winter and you can't blame him. After featuring for just 90 minutes over five matches, his hopes of a World Cup place are slipping away.",
      "But before Zirkzee's time at United is ended, there's a chance that he could work his way back into the plans. Benjamin Sesko will miss the clash with Everton on Monday night and that leaves Ruben Amorim with a problem.",
      "Barring the opening three matches of the season when Sesko was getting up to speed and in tough away games at Liverpool and Tottenham, Amorim has chosen the Slovenian to lead the line. The strikerless system was used as a necessity at the start of the season but has been used sparingly since.",
      "Against a team like Everton, United would ordinarily choose to go with Sesko. The strikerless system tends to have been used against teams where the Reds are expected to not have it all their own way having struggle when Sesko started at Manchester City.",
      "Therefore, if Amorim were to overlook Zirkzee and choose Mason Mount or keep Amad as the No.10, it seems pretty nailed on the Dutchman's future has been decided. Whether United allow him to leave in the January transfer window depends entirely on the boss.",
      "When he was asked in October about Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo leaving, he said: \"I understand that but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise.",
      "\"Players are not playing. They want to play, and there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.\" If Amorim thinks Zirkzee leaving in the middle of the season will compromise his team's chances of progressing this campaign then the striker will not go.",
      "But if Zirkzee is overlooked on Monday while Sesko is out injured it will be the biggest sign yet that Amorim's mind is made up on the Dutchman and his United career will be unlikely to extend beyond next summer.",

      "David Bellion only started five league games during his Manchester United career but the city, the club and the country stuck with him. The Frenchman joined United in 2003 and had his moments in a red shirt. He scored on his full debut, played in the Champions League and won a Community Shield.",
      "But it was away from football where the biggest impression was made. He met his wife in the city and not only fell in love with her, but also the music, the humour and the culture. It added to his already existing interest in the arts, fashion and creativity, and played a part in his journey after football. While many hang up their boots and move into coaching or punditry, Bellion became creative director at French side Red Star FC.",
      "Bellion had ended his playing career at the Paris-based club and his role was to bring together the converging cultures of sport, music, art, fashion and gaming. It played to his interests and is covered in depth in a new book about the club - Red Star Paris, More Than Just A Football Club - which is out now.",
      "In the book, Bellion discusses moving to Manchester to join United and how it harnessed his love of football, fashion and music. In this excerpt of the book, written by Simon Binns, Bellion sets the scene of his life at United. \"‘When I was a kid, I said to my mum, 'one day I’ll play with Ryan Giggs'. I never doubted it. He doesn’t look like a footballer and then you see him on the pitch – unplayable.",
      "\"My problem in Manchester was that I never played week in, week out. And I was very weak tactically. My talent was more emotional, instinctive. Just give me the ball and let me try and do something good. But the best player I got to play with was Juan Sebastian Veron. Even in training, he was the definition of football as style. He just made it look easy. He played with the joy of a child. How do you coach that? I’m not going to give him any advice.",
      "\"In the same dressing room as Bellion was a 19-year- old Cristiano Ronaldo, signed from Sporting Lisbon after several first-team players had struggled to deal with him in a friendly and advised Sir Alex Ferguson to sign him.",
      "\"‘It wasn’t like his talent stood out because there were so many great players, but his drive for hard work was insane,’ says Bellion. ‘I’d never seen that before. At the end of training, he would stay for an hour on his own, just perfecting his game. Every single day.’",
      "\"I ask if he could have his time over and I could grant him the choice of a career in football or music, which he would choose. He answers without missing a beat. ‘I’d be a music producer. I’d be like Dr. Dre or Pharrell [Williams] and just do music.",
      "\"I was obsessed with watching Fade to Black – Rick Rubin and Jay-Z making The Black Album. Timbaland coming up with “Dirt off Your Shoulder” and Jay-Z hearing it for the first time. I had a four-track and the same keyboard as Pharrell. When I first became a footballer, it was my first big expensive purchase.’\"",

Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",
      "Burnham has outlined his vision for Greater Manchester to become “a second city to rival any other on the planet by 2050\" and every district to benefit from “regeneration at a pace and on a scale not seen before this century”.",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",

      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s an immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "United announced the appointment of Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Ratcliffe discussed the importance of bringing in the \"right people\" and landed his prime target.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United confirmed that Sansoni would be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers in the summer window.",
      "In July, Sansoni said United had made \"meaningful progress\" with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\".",
      "He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re only just getting started.\"",
      "United's data-led review of 2024/2025 identified the attack as the priority area for strengthening, concluding the shortage of goals was the biggest factor in the team's underperformance.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens arrived in the second half of the summer transfer window. They were different signings to Cunha and Mbeumo, arriving with no Premier League experience, but the numbers were crunched on both players and United were happy to splash a combined £84.8million.",
      "The press release announcing Sesko's transfer noted that he had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.",
      "Jason Wilcox said: \"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at United.\"",
      "United sources pointed to Lammens' underlying statistics when he signed. They said the Belgium international had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe, with a post-shot expected goals of +14.5, and highlighted he had made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues.",
      "In layman's terms, post-shot expected goals look at how many goals more or less a goalkeeper has conceded than he's been expected to, based on the quality of shots they have faced. Lammens had essentially prevented 14 goals that an 'average' goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to stop.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.\"",
      "Sesko has scored just two goals since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but Ruben Amorim has backed him to succeed. On the other hand, Lammens has \"surprised\" Amorim with the extent of his impact.",
      "United's business in the summer window appears to be an improvement on previous years. How much the data is responsible for that is up for debate, but the club's data department, by all accounts, has improved. Sansoni has played a key role and he is currently recruiting staff.",
      "When Sansoni's appointment was communicated, United said further recruitment is planned for a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "Ratcliffe has been ruthless with his club-wide cuts. The employee count has been slashed significantly and every outgoing penny is now scrutinised, but the data department is not shrinking - it's growing.",
      "The United co-owner believes that investing in data can give United an edge, which will theoretically save millions of pounds in the long run. Just think how much has been wasted on transfer fees alone.",
      "United are in the process of hiring a data operations manager to join Sansoni's team to \"drive data and technology projects forward\". Sansoni has invited hopefuls who are passionate about data to get in touch.",
      "Sansoni is doing important work behind the scenes, impacting United's recruitment.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",
      "\"Then you have to look, to play in the Premier League nowadays, the physicality is something you cannot run from. You need to pay attention to that. Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",
      "\"And we had some issues in the past when we did that, and we got that wrong. And then the most important thing is talent and working hard. That is the things we are looking for from our players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",
      "Next up for United is a clash with Everton at Old Trafford on Monday.",

      "Patrick Dorgu claimed Manchester United \"have enough good players\" when asked whether he would like to share a dressing room with Scott McTominay at Old Trafford after his wonderful goal against Denmark. The former United midfielder was sold in 2024 to Napoli - five months prior to Dorgu's United arrival - and since then he has been impressing in Serie A.",
      "This week the midfielder helped Scotland beat Dorgu's Denmark 4-2 at Hampden Park to secure the home nation's qualification to the World Cup in USA, Mexico and Canada. McTominay opened the scoring after less than five minutes with a tremendous overhead kick.",
      "United loanee Rasmus Hojlund scored from the penalty spot to level the game before Lawrence Shankland guided in a corner to give the Scots the advantage. Denmark only needed a point to qualify automatically and Dorgu's late strike looked to have earned them just that but two late goals saw them settle for a place in the play-offs.",
      "When asked post-match if he would like to be playing alongside McTominay at United, Dorgu said: \"It was a good goal but we also have enough good players at United as well. I am happy for him winning the league in Napoli.\"",
      "The next international break is not until March at which point Denmark will need to beat North Macedonia and then either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland to progress to the World Cup. Dorgu insists his focus is now on succeeding with the Reds until then.",
      "He said: \"100% we just need to look forward. We are in a really good position at United.",
      "\"We will go back with confidence to help the team to get more wins. Denmark is now March. It is a long time and we just need to concentrate on club matters until then.\"",
      "Dorgu is expected to be back in the United squad on Monday night when they host Everton in the Premier League. A win for the Reds could move them into the top four.",

      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Amorim has already offered his thoughts on the scenario United face in the next few months. In that, he insisted it represents an opportunity for other players to step up.",
      "Speaking recently, he said: \"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training, in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "That has led United to send Sancho out on three different loan spells, first back to Dortmund, then to Chelsea, and now Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho’s contract at United is set to expire at the end of the season, which makes it likely he has already played his last game for the club.",

      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER GUFF ON F365\n👉 Man Utd transfer ‘not going to happen in January’ as another deal is rated as a ‘maybe’\n👉 Record-breaking Man Utd transfer in tatters as Real Madrid star’s new contract is ‘already closed’\n👉 Man Utd ‘confident’ of striking cut-price transfer for England international",
      "Caught Offside write that Dortmund are keen to give Sancho a third spell at the club, but not so keen that they are willing to pay the winger anything like the kind of money he is said to be on at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho is reported to be on wages of £300,000 per week – twice the figure that Dortmund would be willing to pay him.",
      "The far greater riches available to Premier League clubs, and especially a massive club like Manchester United, enable them to pay significantly more than Dortmund would reasonably be able to offer.",
      "The Bundesliga side are also said to be unwilling to make an exception and break their wage structure to re-secure Sancho’s signature. That would leave Sancho either needing to take a biiiig old 50% pay cut.",
      "Giving up nearly £8m a year would be a major blow to Sancho’s wallet, of course, though we’re sure sympathy for his position will rightly be somewhat limited given he would, in fact, still be earning nearly £8m a year.",
      "There’s also the fact that, let’s face it, Sancho’s stock is considerably lower now than it was  when he signed that lucrative contract at United, so he may well not get a better offer than whatever Dortmund put on the table.",
      "After his thoroughly underwhelming spell at Chelsea last season, Sancho has still not really got going at Aston Villa. He is yet to make a start in the Premier League, with Unai Emery only opting to name him in the first XI in the Europa League and the League Cup.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Chelsea) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Manchester City) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Crystal Palace) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",
      "3rd) Nottingham Forest (20 games) – worth around £17.7m",
      "=4th) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle (19 games) – worth around £16.9m",

      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "READ: Premier League player power rankings: Haaland the best in the business, but where’s Salah?",
      "And now journalist Mark Brus has told Caught Offside that the Red Devils are ‘increasingly confident’ that they can sign Anderson from Nottingham Forest for significantly less than the £100m mooted in the press.",
      "Brus had heard that a £70m fee ‘might be realistic’ but now sources have told him that Man Utd are hopeful of at least opening talks for even less.",
      "One source told Brus: “Financially, the situation is complex.",
      "“Anderson is under contract with Forest until 2029, giving the club strong leverage. Internally, the club believes Anderson’s value could exceed £100 million if his development continues.",

In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",

But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",

      "Amid talk of a sensational return to Old Trafford for Scott McTominay, Gary Lineker has handed Manchester United an excuse they don’t deserve for selling him in the first place.",
      "McTominay has been deified in Naples after being named Serie A Player of the Year in his debut season under Antonio Conte, starring from midfield as Napoli claimed the Scudetto.",
      "Recent reports claiming United are interested in bringing the 28-year-old back to the club have ramped up on the back of his extraordinary overhead kick to help Scotland beat Denmark and secure their place at the World Cup.",
      "FIFA’s showcase competition is inarguably the stage for a man whose stratospheric rise since Napoli paid just £25.4m to secure his signing from United in August 2024 saw him finish 18th in the Ballon d’Or just over a year later.",
      "To suggest he would even have been in the minds of the voting journalists in his time at United would have been laughable, and the decision-makers at Old Trafford in no way merit the sympathy being afforded to them by Lineker on The Rest Is Football.",
      "“What a spell he’s having in his career. You know, he goes from Manchester United, probably his club that he played for since a boy.",
      "“And then he was probably, I mean, surely they must have seen the talent that he had?",
      "“But I suspect he was sold because of the PSR rules and you get, you know, a bigger advantage because he’s a homegrown lad, which strikes me as absolutely wrong.”",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag did indeed blame the perverse PSR rules when asked why McTominay was sold.",
      "“Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "“It’s not the right thing to do but for everyone, for all parts, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player but also for us.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Full Manchester United XI ‘banned’ as Liverpool transfer critics are silenced\n👉 Prem clubs ranked on AFCON impact: Arsenal advantage, Sunderland screwed\n👉 Former Prem star’s huge wages put Man Utd off as midfielder now has two options",
      "We accept that United probably wouldn’t have sold McTominay for £25.4m if those rules didn’t exist. What we take issue with is Lineker’s claim that United in any way “saw the talent he had”.",
      "He was a squad player; no more than a guy who was ‘good to have around’. He started just 18 Premier League games in his final season and in the two campaigns in which he was the first-choice option he was one half of McFred having been inextricably paired with another player deemed not good enough to be starting regularly for the club.",
      "Conte realised his talent immediately. Having operated as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot in over half of his appearances for his boyhood club, at Napoli he’s played as a No.8, No.10 and even on the wing to ensure he can make the difference in the final third, where he’s evidently at his best.",
      "Pure profit or not, selling McTominay for just £25.4m is evidence enough of what United thought of a player who’s now easily worth twice that much.",

      "Wayne Rooney doesn’t immediately strike as the tinfoil hat-type, but it feels like the mere mention of QPR might at any point lead him off on a tangent which eventually ends in vehemence about how jet fuel doesn’t melt Taye Taiwo and Clint Hill.",
      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",
      "Wayne Rooney says he is “concerned” by Virgil van Dijk’s brutal comments following Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Newcastle and Manchester City shared an absurd first half but the Magpies won in a six-minute second-half burst which Pep Guardiola couldn’t handle.",

      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him.",
      "United are known to want to improve their midfield in January. While Casemiro has turned around a period of inconsistency, he’s due to be out of contract in the summer, while Bruno Fernandes is being played in a deeper role than he’d like.",
      "Other options Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have struggled to convince Ruben Amorim they should be playing.",
      "Premier League stars such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are all being linked, but of late it has been suggested United don’t feel a move for any of them is likely in the winter.",
      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",
      "But there is a key issue in that his £410,000-per-week wages have put off top European clubs, with the suggestion that if a move to United or another interested club such as Newcastle is to happen, the midfielder will have to drop his demands.",
      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told Spurs they have “got to” land a former Premier League star on £410,000 per week, as a separate report has revealed his desire ...",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly identified former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves as their new ‘priority’ target in midfield ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’."

      "They seem to have gotten themselves back into a good spot, challenging towards the top of the Premier League, and signing a past-it Neymar is not going to help them.",
      "Should he join and fail to have an impact – which is likely given he’s not played at a good level for years now – it may only breed discontent within the club, and they’ll have wasted a transfer trying to grant somebody his wish of returning to the Brazilian side.",
      "Further to that, they wouldn’t dream of signing a player with just three league goals in his last season were it anybody else, so signing Neymar would essentially be just for his name.",
      "It’s also a bad look for Neymar if he is to leave. After his emotional homecoming for the swansong of his career, to decide actually, these lot aren’t great and I’m better off going and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, perhaps isn’t the best call.",

      "The upcoming game against Everton is seen as a significant one, with a view of what could be to come in January.",
      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",
      "Indeed, Bryan Mbeumo will be gone then, and Zirkzee represents an option to replace who has clearly been United’s best player so far this term.",
      "As such, if he can show he can deputise for Sesko, the Zirkzee might be given more minutes to bed himself in and get up to speed so that the loss of Mbeumo for weeks does not feel quite as impactful as it might.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has stated the desire is for Zirkzee to stay as an option across the attack.",
      "He said: “But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "“Maybe go on loan, maybe have the opportunity to play on a regular basis, but at the same time, he remains an important player for Man Utd. Look, now there is the AFCON, and so some players are going, there is the injury of Sesko.",
      "“If you have injuries, if you have problems, whatever happens, you need another striker, and Zirkzee can be used as a No.9, as a N0.10 behind the strikers. So for Amorim, he’s an important player. Amorim wants Zirkzee to stay.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could still be asked to stay at Old Trafford despite “good” injury news on Benjamin Sesko.",
      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have performed a ‘U-turn’ on Casemiro, while one exit could ‘open the door’ for a ‘gamble’ January transfer.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee “should have stayed in Italy” with the Dutchman making the “wrong decision” to join the Red Devils, according to Ruud Gullit.",
      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s ex-chief scout.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee has decided his preferred destination as he heads for a loan exit in the January transfer window, says Fabrizio Romano."

      "Boss Ruben Amorim recently said it’s “really important” to keep that streak going, and in their last game, Jack Fletcher was the sole academy player in the squad, replacing Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "With AFCON coming up and each of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui heading off to represent their respective countries, there could be chances for academy players to represent the first team.",
      "That has been posed to the Daily Mail‘s United writer, Nathan Salt, who feels there is ‘honestly, not too many’ options for Ruben Amorim at the moment.",
      "He states that Shea Lacey is the ‘clear frontrunner’ having been very close to making the squad for the Sunderland game of late, while Fletcher – on the bench against Tottenham – is second, as Amorim is known to be a big fan.",
      "Salt feels shouts for Jaydan Kamason and Bendito Mantano to graduate to the first team are premature.",
      "There is said to be a ‘lot of interest’ in Lacey in regards to a loan away from United, but they are said not to be entertaining any, pointing to him being a player of interest in the first team.",

      "Lacey was the highest-rated player for United’s under-21s in that game, receiving an 8.7 SofaScore rating.",
      "Given Mbeumo and Amad, who are going to be unavailable for a while during AFCON, both play on the right-hand side, there could well be an opportunity coming for Lacey.",
      "Largely a right-winger, but also able to play in a slightly less advanced role if required, he could be in a good spot.",
      "Lacey is not the man it was felt is able to play up in the first team, by former United scout Piotr Sadowski, who named Harry Amass – currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "He said: “In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”"

      "After an inconsistent start to the new Premier League season, Amorim won his first back-to-back league games since taking over at Man Utd in mid-October.",
      "That has now led to the Red Devils going five matches unbeaten in the Premier League with Amorim’s side up to seventh in the table, once place ahead of defending champions Liverpool and four points behind second-placed Man City.",
      "There were critics of Amorim’s decision to stick with his 3-4-3 formation earlier in the campaign as Man Utd failed to pick up results as it looked like he was heading for the sack.",
      "However, Amorim has turned things around using the same system and has highlighted that “more confidence” was the key to their recent positive form.",
      "Amorim told Stan Sport: “We are playing better, but we are playing better because we have more confidence, and that starts with good results, for example, against Liverpool.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Manchester United transfer target ‘breaks silence’ amid Liverpool reveal which ‘might be hard for fans to hear’",
      "“We are getting better, but I can share my feeling: when we finished the game against Tottenham and I was coming back to Carrington, I was watching the game and my feeling was frustration, that we are far from perfection.",
      "“We are far from being that team that can win every game. So I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling, and I’ve been saying this for many months, that the formation is not the problem.",
      "“The formation is the start of something, then it’s the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play, how competitive we are.",
      "“If you look at the games we struggled in this season, it was not about the formation for me. It was the lack of intensity. We need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.”",
      "On the public backing from Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Amorim added: “It’s always really important, but it’s more important for the fans to understand that we have a clear path, and we are going to do everything and continue that path no matter what.",
      "“To be honest, it doesn’t change much for me, because I’m not worried about losing my job. I always have that feeling.",
      "“But if you remember when Jim gave that interview, it settled down a lot around the club. The noise changed completely. That was really important for the team, and if it’s important for the team, it’s important for me.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Benjamin Sesko’s injury is “not that serious” ahead of a busy December schedule.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made a Manchester United transfer ‘reveal’ that you, dear reader, will simply fail to ever believe. There might be no point even trying.",
      "We are pulling ourselves away from Jude Bellingham to look at an 11-man Manchester United ban and Liverpool transfer critics.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Marco Silva has suddenly become the Sack Race favourite as Fulham consider a stupid decision, but Eddie Howe and Arne Slot are far from safe…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘monitoring’ a left-field No.6 target as a new midfielder is a ‘priority’ for the Premier League giants."

      "Friday 21 November 2025 14:22, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Friday 21 November 2025 20:02, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has emerged as Ruben Amorim's most important Manchester United player this season.",
      "A stalwart at the back, the central defender is the only player to have played every single minute of United's Premier League campaign so far this term.",
      "With Amorim a known tinkerman, not least during games, especially at centre-back, De Ligt's ever presence is a testament to his growing influence at Old Trafford.",
      "When De Ligt signed for United in August 2024, Old Trafford had acquired a then-24-year-old who had struggled to live up to the lofty billing of his early career.",
      "Having captained Ajax at 18, De Ligt was tipped to become one of the game's finest defenders. He became the first defender to win the Golden Boy in 2018, the trophy awarded to the best U21 player.",
      "That was before his starring role in the Champions League as Ajax famously reached the semi-final in 2019, where his displays in that campaign propelled his worth.",
      "A move to Juventus came next for the defender, with the world at his feet, and Bayern Munich also followed. However, despite a healthy trophy return in that period, the pace of his early development had slowed, and De Ligt had become an injury-prone disappointment.",
      "Now, it seems as though De Ligt has been living through a personal renaissance. At 26, things have started to come together for the Dutchman. He's often used as the right centre-back in Amorim's oft-discussed back three but is more than capable of filling in centrally.",
      "On the opening day, a colossal performance, despite defeat to Arsenal, saw De Ligt take care of Viktor Gyokeres in a showing that paved for things to come.",
      "In the league, his performances have sustained, standing as one of United's outstanding options at the back. Among defenders at the club, De Ligt leads the way for aerial duels won and interceptions.",
      "De Ligt is also among United's best tacklers and passers, factoring in defenders at the club. They are performances that have been rewarded with a recall into the Netherlands National team by boss Ronald Koeman.",
      "For the Dutchman, his upturn in form is a reflection of a growing maturity and fewer injuries.",
      "\"I'm 26 now and I'm entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" De Ligt told Dutch outlet NOS.",
      "\"I've changed my mindset. Initially, I didn't want to make mistakes; now I want to do as many good things as possible.'",
      "Asked about his form, De Ligt added: \"There are a few explanations for that. I've had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body.",
      "\"This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "De Ligt's goal to earn United a draw at Tottenham just before the international break felt like the culmination of months of assured displays. However, despite his history as a leader, De Ligt was not named in Amorim's leadership group.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui were put forward by Amorim as his group to oversee the dressing room at the beginning of the season.",
      "\"Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play,\" Amorim said following the draw at Spurs.",
      "\"Then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other.\"",
      "Amorim's growing reliance on De Ligt, may be a cause for the Portuguese coach to rethink his decision. However, despite De Ligt's form, Amorim believes we are yet to see the Dutchman at his flying best.",
      "\"He is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well,\" Amorim added after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball. That is a smart thing for a player.",
      "\"But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",
      "Amorim's words owe to his desire to one day see United be the dominant side when they are also the side dominating possession. By his own admission, currently, United are some way from that.",
      "However, with the in which he has established himself so far this season, the stalwart that is De Ligt may be the anchor of United's defensive plans going forward.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",
      "The three tests are:",
      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",

      "Manchester United should come with a disclaimer: 'entertaining but structurally unstable.'",
      "Ruben Amorim has a team overflowing with attacking talent, energy and moments of genuine quality yet one that carries enough defensive looseness to turn every 90 minutes into a wild ride. There have been 37 goals in their Premier League games - working to an average of 3.36 per 90. No team averages higher.",
      "They are the must-watch team in the Premier League because of it.",
      "Amorim has realised that they are a team built for moments - not for consistency - and he's embracing it.",
      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games."

      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",

      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",

      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
