      "Mason Mount has revealed England boss Thomas Tuchel called him to offer the Manchester United star hope of a return for the Three Lions.",
      "Mount's last England appearance came at the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, when Gareth Southgate's side went out to France at the quarter-final stage after losing 2-1. Injuries have wrecked Mount's first two seasons at United, following his £60million move from Chelsea, with the 26-year-old managing just 11 starts last term.",
      "Despite being away from the international scene for two and a half years, Mount said his former Chelsea boss Tuchel has left the door open for a return to the England fold – ahead of next year's World Cup in the US.",
      "“He called me” said Mount. “He called me and he said that he's calling a lot of players and just wanted to catch up. I don't know how many players he probably called, 40 or 50 maybe?",
      "“But it was good to see his face, good to catch up with him and good to speak to him. He looked like he had loads of energy, like I remember, and was bang up for the new role. He was very excited and it was obviously good to catch up with him and speak to him and see what he was preparing.",
      "“I played quite a bit under him. We won the Champions League, so that's a positive. But I think with England it's totally different now. I think the competition with places, the amount of people he can pick, it's a bit different than club football. So I don't think it goes hand in hand.",
      "“He said to me there's no guarantees, even though you played for me. But it gives you more, you want to push even more, to be able to be back in the squad. So it was really good to speak to him. He looked very excited.",
      "“As a player, you always want to play for your country and that's such a big honour, to play for your country. Any opportunity that you get to put that shirt on is amazing. I've had 36 caps for England, so I know what it means to be able to play for your country. I'd love to have that opportunity again, but I'm focusing on club football first.",
      "“We need to put right what happened last season. So I'm looking at that first for sure and then we'll see what happens at the end of the season.”",
      "On his personal aims for the upcoming season, Mount said: “I think it's about kicking on from where I was last season. Putting that behind me, the injuries and stuff, and looking forward to what I can do. Focusing on what I bring to the team and knowing what I can do.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s hopes of landing Morten Hjulmand may have been helped by Viktor Gyokeres’ move to Arsenal. United have been strongly linked with the Swedish striker, who played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP, before his transfer to Arsenal.",
      "The Red Devils are keen on another Sporting player, midfielder Hjulmand, who is also wanted by Juventus, according to reports in Italy. However, rather than an outright purchase, the Turin giants are ready to offer Douglas Luiz as part of a swap deal, with Juve paying an additional fee.",
      "However, that plan is complicated by Luiz’s wages, believed to be worth around £4.3million a year, which are well beyond Sporting’s current wage structure. Gazzetta dello Sport reports that will make any potential swap deal virtually impossible to complete.",
      "Having lost Gyokeres, Sporting chief would be loath to lose another of their prized assets. And after agreeing a deal worth up to £64m for Gyokeres, Sporting are under no pressure to sell and can afford to hold out for Hjulmand’s £70million release clause if they wish.",
      "Additional reports in Italy claim Sporting would consider a fee of around £43m, but no lower. Having already splurged £133.5m this summer – and with RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko high on their list of targets – it remains to be seen whether United will land Hjulmand this summer.",
      "However, given Juve’s apparent difficulties in financing a deal, they can afford to bide their time and potentially wait for a future transfer window.",
      "United are looking to offload a number of wantaway stars to help fund the much-needed revamp of Amorim’s squad. However, the head coach has warned that players won't be allowed to leave on the cheap and says they could still have futures at the clubs.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were left out of the tour of the United States and have been training at Carrington instead.",
      "United’s recent transfer dealings have been widely criticised but Amorim said chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Jason Wilcox would not be taken advantage of.",
      "“I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that,” said the United boss.",
      "“I understand clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise and I’m ready. I’m ready to receive the players.”",

      "Manchester United failed to sign Adrien Rabiot three years ago after making a “very disrespectful” demand. That is according to Rabiot’s mother Véronique, who acts as his agent and was responsible for walking away from the negotiating table in 2022.",
      "Back then, United had agreed an initial £15million fee to sign the France international from Juventus. But the transfer stalled and eventually collapsed amid reports that Rabiot’s wage demands were the issue.",
      "Erik ten Hag wanted to clinch a deal for the central midfielder, but United’s lack of Champions League football was a sticking point. Rabiot was leaving Juve, who played in Europe’s best club competition, for United, who were gearing up for a campaign in the Europa League after finishing sixth the season before.",
      "The then-27-year-old and Véronique were accused in the media of being greedy and blamed for the move collapsing. He ended up staying with Juve for another two years before joining Marseille last summer on a free transfer and Véronique has now pushed back against the narrative over the failed United move in an interview with L’Equipe.",
      "“That, too, is completely false,” she said of the allegations of greed over wage demands. “That year, Adrien was ready to leave Juve, who had qualified for the Champions League, for Manchester United, who hadn’t.",
      "“We discussed the terms, and in the end, they said to me: ‘If we don’t qualify for the Champions League at the end of next season, Adrien’s salary will go down.’ I found that really over the top and very disrespectful.”",
      "“I said, ‘We’re stopping’. They thought it was a strategy to get more [money]. But no, it was a matter of principle, not money. Obviously, it surprised them. They’re not used to it.”",
      "Reports at the time said Rabiot was asking for a wage increase from €7m (£6m) per season to €10m (£8.6m). That would have put him squarely in the middle of United’s wage structure at the time, well below top-earners Cristiano Ronaldo, David de Gea and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Véronique was slammed in September by French agent Bruno Satin after she oversaw Rabiot’s move to Marseille, instead of to Atletico Madrid. “It’s the result of the incompetence of the people who accompanied him there,” Satin told RMC Sport.",
      "“He is advised by his mother and it shows that it is good to be accompanied by professionals because if he had been accompanied by a pro, he would be in a European top ten club and what’s more, he was free.",
      "“The first thing is to get his opinion and find out what he wants to do. But it would be more interesting to ask him at the end of May because now [at the end of August], he has done the rounds of the market.",
      "“To take a concrete example, I had the sporting director of Atletico Madrid at the end of July and he told me: ‘I had two conversations with the mother and I stopped immediately because she explained to me where her son should play’. It quickly tires all the professionals, it’s unbearable.”",

      "Manchester United have ruled out a move for Nicolas Jackson after baulking at Chelsea's demands. The Red Devils are on the hunt for a new striker as Ruben Amorim continues to reboot his forward line.",
      "United have already brought in £133.5million worth of attacking talent; Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo, deals which showcase their focus on signing players with a proven track record in the Premier League.",
      "It comes after a move for Jackson, 24, was ruled out by United chiefs, according to the Athletic. It was previously claimed that Chelsea would demand between £80m and £100m for the Senegal international, who's dropped down at the pecking order at Stamford Bridge after the Blues paid £60m and £30m respectively for Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "United are now stepping up their pursuit of Watkins, who Villa privately insist isn't for sale at any price. But there's a belief at Old Trafford that a deal can be done for the 29-year-old.",
      "Although the Red Devils are reluctant to match the £60m which Arsenal bid for Watkins in January, they're hoping to find an agreement in the £40m to £45m range. Newcastle have also been linked with the Villa star, as they brace to receive a bid from Liverpool for Isak.",
      "United are looking to reunite Watkins with Mbeumo, as the pair scored 40 Championship goals between them in the 2019-20 season for Brentford. But should Villa dig their heels in, Amorim's side could look to Sesko.",
      "United's interest in the Slovenian dates back to when he was 16 and they've looked at signing him on a further two occasions. When Sesko put pen to paper his new five-year contract contract in 2024, there was a gentlemen's agreement that should an elite club - by the player's definition - offer between £69m to £78m, Leipzig would sanction his departure.",
      "Should they turn to Sesko, United have a secret weapon who could help negotiations run smoothly. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell worked in executive roles at Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig in 2019 and 2022, the years in which Sesko signed for both clubs.",

      "Paul Scholes suggested Ralph Hasenhuttl for the Manchester United job three years ago following the departure of Ralf Rangnick, but Ryan Bertrand was far from pleased by his management style at Southampton.",
      "Rangnick was appointed interim Red Devils manager in November 2021 in the wake of the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, he only lasted until the end of the season following a dismal campaign at Old Trafford which culminated in a sixth-place finish with an at the time club-record low of 58 points.",
      "Despite a four-year career with the Saints culminating in a 2021/22 relegation battle before his dismissal, Scholes saw Hasenhuttl as the perfect fit for United given his style of play. Speaking to BT Sport in 2022, Scholes said: \"I've always liked the football he plays at Southampton with not the best squad.",
      "\"The type of football has worked for them. His teams have been good to watch; I think it comes across really well. I think people around this club, and fans especially, are thinking more of possibly [Mauricio] Pochettino or an Antonio Conte and what people have been at the bigger clubs.",
      "\"The more I think about it, I don't think [going for Hasenhuttl] would be a bad thing. The way he goes about his business, he looks good.\"",
      "United ultimately appointed Erik ten Hag as new head coach ahead of 2022/23, with Hasenhuttl enduring a two-year lay-off before taking up tenure with VfL Wolfsburg in 2024. While Scholes saw the 57-year-old as an ideal fit for the club that the former midfielder still holds close to home, Bertrand's first opinions of Hasenhuttl were far from stellar.",
      "The now retired left-back spent six years at St Mary's, making 240 appearances before parting ways for Leicester City in 2021. And while he played under Hasenhuttl for the final three years of his tenure in Southampton, the 35-year-old didn't see eye-to-eye with him as he took up tenure.",
      "Speaking on the Business of Sport podcast, Bertrand said: \"To be honest, I have a lot of respect for him, and I actually really like him. He's a really good guy, but at the start when he come in, he come in fully egotistical.",
      "\"Thinking anyone 30-plus or 28-plus is like the enemy cause they can't learn new things. It's his way or the highway, everyone needs to listen, there's no talking back. And it was like, 'You need feedback, cause I've been with a lot of managers that have done a little bit more than what you do and they listen to people, and this is how you survive in the Premier League.'",
      "\"But I think he sensed that and he was so paranoid of other people perhaps making him look like he's not the number one. Confusing feedback for talking back, he was so authoritarian approach. This way, that way.\"",
      "Bertrand also recalled how his reaction to one game in particular also caused friction between himself and Hasenhuttl, claiming that he saw himself demoted from the starting XI and phased out in favour of players who weren't even natural left-backs.",
      "Bertrand explained how the Saints were losing a game and he was substituted off in the dying moments despite being an attacking full-back and the team in need of a goal, a move which baffled him.",
      "But when he approached Hasenhuttl to ask on his theory behind the substitution, he claims that the manager became defensive before freezing him out. He added: \"He was a bit hostile and was like,' You know, it was just a decision that I made,' and I was like, 'Alright, no problem.'",
      "\"And I left the room, and then after that we just never spoke. He was playing people like Moussa Djenepo, he was playing him left-back. He was playing Kevin Danso left-back...like centre-backs left-back, wingers left-back, anything to kind of provoke a reaction out of me.",
      "\"But I wouldn't because I want to win. It's fine, if you want to play that it's no problem. I'll just train every day and didn't kind of say nothing.\"",
      "Bertrand then spoke to a director at Southampton to ask what was Hasenhuttl's issue, only to be told that the manager wasn't happy with the substitution incident. However, Bertrand claimed that towards the end of his tenure at St Mary's, that Hasenhuttl turned things around and changed his approach to football management, actively engaging with players more and coming across more friendly.",
      "He explained: \"Towards the end he went full circle. And he slowly, slowly... he ended up going 360. Ended up being more personable, talking to everyone, trying to be people's best mate, had more of a character. And I just thought, 'You weren't worth my time,' because that moment at the start, he was very disrespectful.\"",
      "He added: \"From the early days of respect was a one way street with him, and then coming back and then killing my game, and then needed me to stay. Why would I stay?\"",
      "Bertrand made the move to Leicester City in a free transfer in 2021, making just 11 appearances for the Foxes before announcing his retirement from football in June 2024.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was once hailed as a better player than Manchester City's Erling Haaland by a coach who has worked with both stars. Manchester United's search for a new striker looks to have led them to Red Bull Leipzig's star forward, Sesko, although they haven't ruled out a move for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko, 22, boasts an impressive record of 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has caught the eye of several top-flight English clubs. United are now poised to make their move for the much-admired striker, but face a battle for his signature with Newcastle.",
      "Former Red Bull Salzburg coach Rene Aufhauser once shared his belief that Sesko could even surpass Haaland in terms of potential. Haaland, now 25, had a stint at Salzburg from 2019 to 2020, while Sesko played for the Austrian side between 2020-2023.",
      "\"Benjamin is maybe the better football player, better to play with the team, technically maybe better at the same age,\" Rene Aufhauser said to The Mail in 2022, when Sesko was just 19. \"His natural movements are so good, he's 6ft 4in tall, fast and has very, very good physical ability.",
      "\"He's so smooth with the ball, very good technique, good finishing and he jumps so high. Very, very, good with the head. It's unbelievable.",
      "\"Erling [Haaland] was mentally a monster and (mentally) better at the same age,\" Aufhauser continued. \"This is the last five, 10 per cent that Benji has to get.\"",
      "While Sesko is younger, it's true that by 22 - the Slovenian's current age - Haaland had already scored his big-money move to City, where he won the Premier League in his maiden season with the Citizens. He has consistently been the league's most feared frontman since teaming up with Pep Guardiola, winning two top-flight titles and the Champions League.",
      "Sesko actually turned down United three years ago in favour of a move to Leipzig but is now eager to secure a high-profile transfer this summer. The Slovenian is contracted to Leipzig until 2029, but his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept the lines of communication open since United's initial approach and even visited their Carrington training complex.",
      "So, if United do make a play for Sesko, does he have what it takes to succeed in the Premier League? Aufhauser felt that the three-time Slovenian Youth Footballer of the Year still had some way to go before he could be considered the complete package.",
      "\"He needs experience at this level and also maybe to learn to handle and deal with disappointment,\" he said in 2022. \"Sometimes he wants to be perfect. He has to stay cool, stay calm and to wait for his next chance. This is maybe the biggest thing he has to learn.\"",
      "Fast forward three years, armed with three Austrian Bundesliga titles and a goalscoring tally that would make many of Europe's top strikers envious, it seems Sesko might just be poised to take the leap to United – potentially challenging Haaland as one of England's most fearsome forwards.",

      "Sancho was at Chelsea last term and prior to that had a short loan stint at Dortmund, the club where he first made his name. The Daily Mail now reports that a third spell at the German club could be on the cards.",
      "United signed Sancho for just over £70million but he's been unable to deliver on that fee. As a result they're willing to sell up and a move to either Juventus or Dortmund is being talked up.",
      "The Manchester outfit would accept between £15m and £17m, which represents a mammoth loss. However that figure is necessary to tempt potential buyers given that neither Juventus or Dortmund have the finances to break the bank to land Sancho.",
      "United had a deal in place with Chelsea to make Sancho’s loan a permanent deal, worth up to £25m, at the end of last season, but the Londoners chose to pay a £5m penalty to rip up the agreement. The England international is also entering the final year of his contract.",
      "He currently earns £275,000-a-week, a figure he would need to take a massive cut on, and his decline since moving to Manchester has seen him fall out of the picture with the Three Lions. It was at Dortmund that he was first capped by his country.",
      "Last summer when the German club reached the Champions League final, with Sancho playing a key role, there was talk of a permanent switch but club chief Sebastian Kehl admitted that finances were an issue. “In the end, it will take money (to sign Sancho). A lot of money. Definitely more than we have at the moment, that’s clear,\" he said at the time.",
      "As well as Sancho United have the likes of Antony and Alejandro Garnacho at the club, but they are trying to shift them in the coming weeks. Amorim has maintained the club have their valuations and opened the door to them being reintegrated into the squad if they do remain.",

      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, he said: “They’re going to have to recruit very well because clearly a lot of these players are not good enough or not suited to that style of play. They’re a million miles off it on and off the pitch and I don’t know how they get out of this.",
      "“How do they attract top players this summer and are they even going to be able to pay for them now they’re not in the Champions League? Why would big players want to go there?”",
      "However, contrary to Shearer’s view, it seems Sesko has not been put off by the lack of European football on offer at United amid reports he is favouring a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle, who have qualified for UEFA’s top club competition.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, Sesko has reacted positively to United’s interest. Amorim has already strengthened his forward line this summer with big-money moves for Bryan Mbeumo - who also picked them over a club playing in the Champions League - and Matheus Cunha, but the United boss still wants to add more firepower to his squad.",
      "Newcastle aren’t out of the race to sign the 22-year-old. The Magpies’ need for a quality forward has intensified after Alexander Isak made it clear he wants to leave the club amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Newcastle are under no pressure to sell their star striker but are giving serious consideration to cashing in on a Swede, who was sent home from the club’s recent friendly at Celtic before being ruled out of their pre-season tour to Asia.",
      "Head coach Eddie Howe insists the final decision over Isak will be made by the club’s board. He said: “I wouldn't put a timescale on it. I think with these situations, it has to be right for the football club, and everything then is taken into context below that.",
      "“But the club will make the right decision with all the information that it has, and ultimately, to try and move the club forward in whatever way that is. Then it’s up to us to make good decisions the other way and try and improve the squad as best we can. That’s what we're trying to do, regardless of Alex's situation.",
      "“But I think there's a wider picture here. There’s a whole football club that has to make the decision. The ownership, together with the board of directors, especially with the money involved in modern day transfers. The manager of course has an opinion, but ultimately the decision will rest with the board.”",

      "Manchester United are stepping up their bid to sign a striker before the start of the new season – with Ollie Watkins now their first-choice target.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United are continuing that strategy with a move for Watkins, but are understood to be unwilling to meet Villa's £60million valuation of the 29-year-old.",
      "There is hope among the United hierarchy that a compromise figure of £40m-£45m for Watkins can be reached with Villa and enable a deal to be struck between the two clubs.",
      "Watkins scored 17 goals last season, 16 in the Premier League, with Amorim wanting a striker who can go straight into United's team and start scoring regularly, without needing time to adapt.",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping tabs on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are in pole position to sign the 22-year-old Slovenian.",
      "United are exploring the possibility of deals for Watkins and Sesko, but a move for Nicolas Jackson has been ruled out due to Chelsea's £80million asking price for him.",
      "While Amorim is keen to get a new striker signed as quickly as possible to give him time to settle in and build up an understanding with his new team-mates, he accepts that negotiations could drag on.",
      "In order to fund a move for a striker, United must raise revenue from player sales, with the double sale of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony – both left out of the US tour squad - enough to cover the cost of a new front man.",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia, who joined Garnacho and Antony in being left behind by Amorim, while Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona has saved around £12m, with the Spanish giants covering his wages for the whole of next season.",
      "United's determination to sign a new striker casts doubt over the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled last season, scoring just 10 goals from 52 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Villa sources insist Watkins is not for sale, but they wanted £60m from Arsenal in January, before changing their stance when Jhon Duran left to join Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a fresh move for PSG star Randal Kolo Muani, having previously targeted the forward in 2023. The club ultimately opted to sign Rasmus Hojlund ahead of Kolo Muani that summer, but the France international looks to be available once again.",
      "United were enticed by Hojlund’s long-term potential, having impressed during his time at Atalanta, resulting in an eye-catching £72million move to Old Trafford. After a slow start, the young Dane ended his debut season with 16 goals in all competitions, but he found the net on just 10 occasions last term.",
      "As United work on improving their frontline through the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim’s side have also been linked with a new number nine. Kolo Muani may have been snubbed in favour of Hojlund two years ago, but reports in Italy have claimed that United are targeting the PSG forward, who spent time on loan at Juventus last season.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that United have entered the race to sign Kolo Muani. The France international completed an initial £65m (€75m) move to PSG in 2023 following a prolific spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, which had also caught United's attention.",
      "The 26-year-old has since struggled to cement his place at the French club but showed signs of his best form during his Juventus loan spell, scoring 10 goals in 22 games. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani remains a top target for Juventus and discussions with PSG are ongoing, but United are also pursuing the forward.",
      "It is reported that United’s interest in Kolo Munai, who is claimed to favour a return to Turin, has become more concrete since missing out on Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. Meanwhile, PSG are keen to complete a permanent sale for the forward, though Juventus are said to have proposed a £8.6m (€10m) loan fee ahead of a future £39m (€45m) deal.",
      "However, if United succeed in snapping up Juventus target Kolo Muani, it could have a knock-on effect for Hojlund. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani heading to Old Trafford would lead Juventus to have an interest in signing Hojlund on loan.",
      "Hojlund does have Serie A experience from his sole season with Atalanta. The 22-year-old scored nine league goals for the Bergamo club before sealing his big-money move to United.",
      "The potential arrival of Kolo Muani would threaten Hojlund’s place in the pecking order. He is already competing with Joshua Zirkzee and youngster Chido Obi for a starting spot, while new signings Cunha and Mbeumo could also be viewed as alternative centre-forwards.",
      "Kolo Muani is in need of a fresh start, as it recently emerged that he has been made to train with the youth team as PSG looks to offload the forward. If a move fails to materialise this summer, he faces the unenviable task of competing with PSG’s Champions League-winning attack for game time.",
      "United have also been linked with moves for Aston Villa ’s Ollie Watkins and Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic. However, United boss Amorim recently played down the team’s need for new signings.",
      "\"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player,” Amorim explained. “If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "He added: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "Manchester United have been sent a come and get me plea by one of their transfer targets. Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is one of the players being considered to strengthen the position and he is very keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Ruben Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for his back-up Bayindir to fail to take his chance in goal.",
      "The situation has led to much speculation over potential targets this summer, with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma emerging. United even approached Villa over a loan deal for Martinez, only for their offer to be rejected out of hand, while Donnarumma is unlikely to swap Champions League winners for a side that finished 15th last season.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper, is clearly a much more attainable target for United at this stage. He is reportedly available for a fee of around £13m-17m after Antwerp sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes in his side’s 1-1 draw against Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in the league at the weekend. But speaking afterwards, it is clear that Lammens is courting a move away from Belgium.",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",
      "He added: “I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place. Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between.",
      "“As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.",
      "“It could be within a few days, but also a few months or a year. I have people around me who help me with that, and that way I can focus on what I need to do.”",
      "Royal Antwerp manager Stef Wils won’t stand in his way if United do come calling. “He’s proven why,” he said, referring to the transfer interest. “He has everything a modern goalkeeper needs, and as a young lad, he still has room to grow in a major league. He exudes calm and inspires confidence in his defenders, a plus on high balls.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United still have a lot of work to do in the summer transfer window after signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United endured a miserable 2024/25 season and know they need major reinforcements if they are to turn things around. Cunha, a £62.5million addition from Wolves, and Mbeumo, who cost a potential £71m from Brentford, are big signings, but it has been slow going on other fronts.",
      "The most important is at centre-forward, where United missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. They cannot afford another miss and have identified some new targets, including Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United know how difficult it can be to sign a striker, having missed out on at least three occasions already this summer to rivals. Well, another similar situation could be brewing with RB Leipzig striker Sesko and Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies lost out on Ekitike to Liverpool and need to replace Callum Wilson, even if Alexander Isak stays put. They are moving for Sesko and it appears to be a straight shoot-out with United, who are also interested.",
      "Local newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung says Sesko’s agent is in talks with both Newcastle and United and it could come down to the choice of the Slovenian. In that case, Sesko would ‘undoubtedly’ pick Ruben Amorim’s side, despite the fact they can’t offer any European football and Newcastle are in the Champions League.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is keen on a move to Manchester United. Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Ambitious moves for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma have gone nowhere, but Lammens is available for €15-20million (£13-17m).",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters after sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",

Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Al-Nassr appear to be coming to Manchester United’s rescue with a move for Antony. The Brazilian is one of the outcasts Amorim is desperate to sell, but a move back to Real Betis, following a successful loan spell, never materialised due to financial problems.",
      "Now the Saudi Arabian side have made their interest known. Fresh off the back of agreeing a deal for one Premier League flop, in the form of Chelsea’s Joao Felix, Al-Nassr also want to do the charity of signing Antony to join Sadio Mane and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.",
      "Antony would consider such a move, according to his agent, so it looks like a goer. Having already got rid of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, this would leave Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho as the final unwanted players to offload.",

      "Meanwhile, boss Amorim has already spoken about what he wants from his new signings. He said: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",

      "Sesko, who has scored 39 goals for Leipzig over the past two seasons, has already revealed what could help him make a decision - a potential new club’s style of play. Speaking after he signed for Leipzig, he said: \"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations, but I think it was better to come here.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",

      "But instead of joining the side on their pre-season tour, Vitek has penned a new deal until the summer of 2028 and straight away moved to Championship side Bristol City on a season-long loan. The Czech Republic youth international has previously had spells on loan with Accrington Stanley and Austrian side Blau-Weiß Linz.",
      "On completing his move to Ashton Gate, Vítek said: “I’m really excited, for me the Championship is a new level. More games is a big positive for me and I can’t wait to get to know all the players and staff better.”",
      "Vitek will now hope to earn more experience having been tipped for big things by Academy lead goalkeeping coach Tommy Lee. He said: \"Radek has done great out there in Austria.",
      "“He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well. He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers in the Academy.",
      "“He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional and that is going to take him, I believe, to the top level.",
      "\"He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He's 6ft 6ins and that always helps! For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",

      "Ugarte, signed from Paris St Germain a year ago, endured a tough first season as United ended in 15th place – their worst Premier League finish. The Uruguay star failed to deliver on his huge transfer fee and was an unused sub for United's last two games of the season – including the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "But Ugarte impressed in United's 2-1 win over West Ham in the opening game of their US tour at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The 24-year-old pressed high, regularly won back possession and went on a fine run to set Amad up for a goal that was ultimately ruled out for offside.",
      "It was a positive start to pre-season for Ugarte, one which suggests he could start in midfield for United in their season opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Asked if he will start the new season with more confidence, Ugarte said: “Without a doubt. I know the rivals, I know the team-mates [better]. All of this is important. Sometimes the connections take time to get to know each other.",
      "“I already know the league, the rivals, which is important. So I’m very happy, but we have to keep going.",
      "“Last year we made some changes. We changed our coach, we changed our formation. We got to know the Premier League.",

      "Marcus Rashford's humiliating debut for Barcelona comes almost 10 years after his first start for Manchester United, after which he was hailed by former team-mate Michael Carrick. Rashford joined the La Liga champions last week on a season-long loan move after becoming surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "After kicking off life in Catalonia by training with his new team-mates, Rashford then flew out on the club's pre-season tour of Japan. A 3-1 victory over J-League side Vissel Kobe followed in what was his first match for the club.",
      "However, it was an embarrassing baptism for Rashford, who came on at half-time before being replaced in just the 78th minute. His low-key bow for Barca is worlds apart from when former United star Carrick gushed over Rashford's senior debut for his boyhood club in February 2016.",
      "Rashford was only 18 when he was brought into the United starting line-up against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League as a last-minute replacement for the injured Anthony Martial. He quickly announced himself to the world as he scored twice in a 5-1 United win.",
      "Afterwards, in what is a far cry from the reaction to his Barca debut, Carrick lauded Rashford. \"It's great. You can't put a price on that for the younger lads, especially Marcus. It's incredible and brings back memories for me, when I made my debut,\" Carrick told MUTV.",
      "\"It's what football's all about, and what this club has been about for so long. For a local lad to do that and come through the system like that, I'm delighted for him.\"",
      "After his first minutes for Barcelona, manager Hansi Flick explained why the 27-year-old came off just over half an hour after coming on. \"He's [a] week behind the others,\" Flick said.",
      "\"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us. The first 30 minutes were fantastic.",
      "\"After that we lost a bit of control, but the second half was also very good. I'm pleased. What they do with the ball, how they pressed us, it’s really interesting. You can tell they have a clear idea, and it’s similar to ours.\"",
      "Rashford hadn't played for United since December 2024 after being dropped by Amorin. He spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Barca have the option to make Rashford's deal permanent for £26million next summer after he was handed the No. 14 shirt, previously worn by Thierry Henry at the club. Since arriving, he has claimed that his new residence feels like home.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford told Barcelona's YouTube channel upon his unveiling. \"It's a club where people's dreams come true, they win big prizes. What the club stands for means a lot for me.",
      "\"I feel like I'm at home and a big factor in my choice to come here is because it is a family place and a good place for good players to showcase their skills. Another factor is because the conversations I had with [Hansi Flick] were positive.",
      "\"What he did last season was terrific. To lead such a young team to a very successful season and come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club and it's everything I wished. I'm eager to learn the Barcelona way.\"",
      "Next up for Barcelona is a friendly against Seoul in the South Korean capital on Thursday. Rashford will have a reunion with ex-United team-mate Jesse Lingard, who captains the K-League side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford suffered one of the biggest humiliations a top-level footballer can endure on Sunday. The Manchester United forward completed what he hoped to be a dream loan move to Barcelona last week as he looks to get his career back on track.",
      "The deal, which was finalised in time for Rashford to fly to Japan with the rest of the Barca squad, gives the La Liga champions an option to buy the forward for £26million at the end of the season. Rashford’s first pre-season outing came against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, where he started the game on the bench.",
      "Flick brought the 27-year-old on for his much-anticipated debut at half-time, with Rashford showing glimpses of promise and working hard to track back in his new Blaugrana colours. However, he was quickly cut down to size as manager Hansi Flick took him off after just 33 minutes, moments after playing a key role in Barcelona’s second goal.",
      "Rashford and left-back Jofre Torrents made way for Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, who scored Barca’s third goal. While the substitution would have stung Rashford, Flick explained that his decision was not performance related, saying: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Just seven days ago, Rashford had been part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ – the group training alone and made to use the club’s Carrington training ground only once the first-team squad had gone home for the day.",
      "One player who knows exactly how Rashford would have felt this weekend is former Tottenham midfielder Hossam Ghaly. He was signed by Spurs in 2006 and was used sporadically by then-head coach Martin Jol during the 2006/07 season.",
      "After being in and out of the squad, the Egyptian was brought on against Blackburn Rovers in the first half of the penultimate game of the Premier League season after an injury to Steed Malbranque. But, like Rashford, he found himself substituted 31 minutes after his introduction – only his substitution WAS due to a poor performance.",
      "Unlike Rashford, Ghaly responded in the worst possible way, furiously throwing his shirt on the ground while walking off the pitch. The act infuriated the Spurs faithful as jeers and chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” rang around the stadium.",
      "Ghaly was disciplined by the club and left out of the matchday squad on the final day of the season, before making a public apology. He said: \"I am just so angry with myself. I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect.",
      "\"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me.",
      "\"I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given my best all the time and played some decent football.",
      "\"It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart.",
      "\"I know my reaction was totally wrong,\" he added. \"I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season.\"",
      "Despite his best efforts at reconciliation, it marked Ghaly’s last game for Spurs as he was sent out on loan to Derby County in January 2008. He returned to north London for the 2008/09 season but didn’t play a single game before his permanent departure.",
      "Harry Redknapp considered bringing him on during a January 2009 clash with Wigan, but the Englishman decided against it after hearing the fans boo Ghaly while he was warming up and preparing to come on off the bench.",
      "Rashford will want to avoid such a fate at Barcelona, though he will also hope that Flick does not make a habit of subjecting him to external ridicule. The England international has had his fair share of spats with United managers Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim in recent years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "England midfielder Ella Toone was playing in memory of her late father as she helped the Lionesses win another European Championship. Nick Toone was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after he watched Ella score in the 2022 final, as England beat Germany 2-1 at Wembley.",
      "In September of last year, Nick died three days short of his 60th birthday. \"For the past few months, I've been trying to figure it all out, trying to get unstuck,\" Ella wrote for the Players' Tribune in January.",
      "\"It's still raw. I still feel the pain digging in, the gutting feeling of not having him here anymore.\"",
      "The Manchester United vice-captain continues to be inspired by her dad and topped off her most challenging season yet with another international trophy. Toone started all but one of England's matches on their way to the final and produced another lung-busting display against Spain.",
      "She was replaced by Beth Mead in the 87th minute, as the Lionesses dug in and took the game to extra-time and penalties before getting their hands on the trophy for the second time in three years. Post-match, Toone shared two emotional Instagram stories and revealed that her mum had been sat next to a spare seat at the final in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "\"Spare seat next to my mum tonight,\" she wrote alongside an image of the empty seat. \"If that's not a sign I don't know what is. I know you were there Dad. Love you cock.\"",
      "Toone also posted a selfie with Mead - who lost her mum, Jane, to ovarian cancer in January 2023 - with the caption: \"We did it for our angels in the sky. Forever with us & forever proud.\"",
      "Who was your Player of the Tournament for England? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "One of Ella's aunties, Tracy Haslam, told the BBC ahead of the tournament: \"He went to all the away games, he went to the World Cup [in 2023]. He used to be right by her side all the time when it came to a football.",
      "\"It's just a bit harder now her dad's not here. There's a lot of firsts when you lose someone close. It's quite hard for when she plays a game, you can see it sometimes, that she misses him.\"",
      "Nick will be proudly looking down on Ella, who scored two goals and provided two assists during England's successful campaign. She also helped United finish third in the Women's Super League last season, having been at the club since they turned professional in 2018.",
      "Sarina Wiegman's legends have made history and brought football home once more after defending their title and winning Euro 2025 in Switzerland. We have produced this special souvenir edition of the Women's Football News.",

      "Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan has given some advice to Newcastle over Alexander Isak.",

      "\"Don't use all the forces of the fact that you're a football club that achieved something last year, your second Premier League title in 33 years but you've achieved it now and in the last five years, your club has re-emerged as a force in English football, dominating leagues.",
      "\"But don't use that as an opportunity just to unsettle the player. Make a bid, or I'm going to make it really, really hard for you to buy this player. And I'm going to take the consequences of it, and the player will have to accept the principles of what I'm saying, and it can be done.\"",
      "Crystal Palace have sent David Ozoh back to Derby County on loan for the 2025/26 season.",

      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",

      "Manchester United are weighing up a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma after Paris Saint-Germain agreed a £34.9million deal to sign a new goalkeeper. Donnarumma, 26, has seen his future plunged into uncertainty after failing to agree a new contract.",
      "The Italy international's current deal with PSG expires next summer and the European champions don't want to lose him for nothing. Luis Enrique's side will therefore listen to offers for Donnarumma after striking an agreement with Lille to sign Lucas Chevalier.",
      "PSG's move could spring United into action, with Ruben Amorim keen on a new goalkeeper of his own. The Red Devils are understood to be interested in Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens, who'd provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Although Onana has no plans to leave Old Trafford, the Cameroonian's form has been an issue for Amorim. The United manager even took the 29-year-old out of the firing line towards the end of last season after a string of mistakes.",
      "But instead of signing an up-and-coming shot-stopper like Lammens, the vastly experienced Donnarumma could be an option after privately discussing a move to England with his Italy team-mates. French outlet L'Equipe report that as PSG prepare to welcome Chevalier, both United and rivals Manchester City have registered their interest in Donnarumma.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with a move while Galatasaray are said to have gone a step further by making a formal approach. It'd be a surprise if City put their hat in the ring after they struck a £27m deal with Burnley to re-sign James Trafford.",
      "The topic of Donnarumma's future was bubbling under the surface as the ex-AC Milan wonderkid helped PSG finally get their hands on the Champions League in May. As recently as last month, Donnarumma confirmed that it was his priority to stay in Paris.",
      "\"My priority is to stay at PSG, I don't think there will be any problems in the negotiations,\" Donnarumma told Sky Italia on June 9. \"We're a great team.\"",
      "Napoli have also been linked with Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - dismissed the speculation by labelling it 'pure fantasy'. \"I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juventus who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganising: these factors are fundamental.\"",

      "Well-placed sources have suggested Watkins would be open to joining United, who want a new starting striker following the £133.5million investments to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago in favour of joining Leipzig but is keen to secure a major move this summer. Sesko is under contract at Leipzig until 2029.",
      "The Slovenia international's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue with United and visited their Carrington training complex and Old Trafford since holding talks about a possible move in 2022.",
      "Watkins turns 30 on December 30 but has entered the final two years of his Villa contract and has played in the Premier League for five years. The England international has scored 75 goals in 184 Premier League games.",
      "Former Brentford striker Watkins has started at least 30 Premier League matches in each of his five seasons with Villa and has only missed seven games through injury for the club.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted the club had specifically targeted Cunha and Mbeumo due to their Premier League nous. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have scored more league goals than Watkins in the past three campaigns.",
      "Villa were receptive to letting Watkins leave in the winter transfer window but ended up selling Jhon Duran to Al Nassr for £71million instead. Arsenal had a bid of around £60m rejected for Watkins.",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap, Manchester United have been chasing shadows in their pursuit of a striker this summer.",
      "Delap was identified as United's top striker target ahead of the summer transfer window. Following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship, Delap was available via a £30million release clause. Unfortunately for United, Chelsea won the race for his signature, signing him in time for the start of the Club World Cup.",
      "Although Delap did well for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals, signing him to spearhead United's attack after just one season as a Premier League regular would have been a huge risk, meaning it is somewhat bold to suggest missing out on him was a 'blow'.",
      "Nevertheless, missing out on him has delayed their striker search. The additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have bolstered their attack, but they are still missing the main piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres, who has now joined Arsenal, have been and gone, while reports linking them with Victor Osimhen have persisted for as long as one can remember. Exactly where United's striker search will end remains to be seen.",
      "However, according to widespread reports, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has made his way back onto United's radar. Former football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer in 2022.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, have entered discussions with Sesko's representatives.",
      "With Delap, Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, who was also on United's radar earlier this summer, having all been snapped up already this summer, United's options are dwindling.",
      "United acknowledge they need to recruit a high-end striker to beef up Ruben Amorim's attack, and Sesko is arguably one of the very few left on the market that could be attainable.",
      "It goes without saying Leipzig will want a hefty-sized fee for the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal at the Red Bull Arena. He joined Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and signed a contract extension in June last year.",
      "Two seasons into his career in Germany, the Slovenian has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances in Leipzig colours. He scored 21 times last term.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article; he is still fairly young and finding his feet. In all honesty, United should be targeting someone more established and with a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Nevertheless, Sesko is an option United are reportedly running the rule over once again. And when you remember who is leading their recruitment this summer, it should come as no surprise.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who joined United last year, has been empowered to oversee the club's recruitment network and is a key part of the football structure at Old Trafford. Prior to joining the Reds, Vivell had stints at Chelsea and Leipzig.",
      "After joining the Bundesliga club in August 2020, he became their technical director, meaning he was responsible for recruitment and scouting across all age groups. He had previously spent five years at Salzburg, so is well-versed in the Red Bull model.",
      "Having swapped Salzburg for Leipzig, Sesko followed in his footsteps in 2023, swapping Austria for Germany. Leipzig agreed a deal to sign him in 2022, but the deal did not come into effect until the following year.",
      "Vivell was responsible for Leipzig's recruitment at the point of signing Sesko, meaning he knows all about the striker. He will be advising United and giving them insight on what he could potentially bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Sales, of course, remain key to United's chances of being able to land a big-name striker, and Sesko will command a big fee, but Vivell could make all the difference if a transfer tug-of-war unfolds.",

      "He spearheaded United's attack and was very unfortunate not to give the Reds the lead inside the opening 50 seconds, smashing an excellent effort against the woodwork.",
      "Hojlund made several intelligent runs against the Hammers and was a general nuisance. Of course, the caveat is that pre-season games are very different to competitive fixtures.",
      "Nevertheless, Hojlund should be encouraged by his display. Of course, he is fighting to keep his place in the starting XI ahead of this coming season amid United's desperate need to sign a new striker.",
      "Even if Hojlund, for example, scores four goals in United's final three friendlies, the club will still need to sign a striker. On the flip side, a successful pre-season campaign for the Dane could elevate his stock and trigger more interest from elsewhere.",
      "Furthermore, a good pre-season could convince United to retain him and keep him as their second striker. That is the role he should have been signed to fill back in 2023.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly being watched closely by those at AC Milan.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan are searching for a striker who will provide competition with Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Hojlund is said to fit the bill, with Darwin Nunez and Juve star Dusan Vlahovic also of interest.",

      "Fabrizio Romano expressed that on Monday, United's hierarchy opened up conversations about trying to beat Newcastle United to his signature. In a video uploaded to YouTube, he said:",
      "Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko's camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision. So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request.",
      "Any deal is seen as slightly complicated due to the finances involved, given the Red Devils still need to seek exits for the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "His price remains set at £60-70m this summer, with add-ons perhaps taking a deal closer to the £80m mark.",
      "Following the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha already this summer, United's next task is to try and find a striker.",
      "They are desperate to secure a new No.9 this summer and they have been linked with countless names in recent weeks and months.",
      "But after signing two Premier League proven attackers to strengthen their No.10 options, it would be no surprise if United followed suit in their search for a natural No.9.",
      "Liam Delap was attainable via a £30million release clause but ended up at Chelsea, meaning that has forced United to look elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "In truth, there are a limited number of Premier League strikers United could realistically try and sign before the end of the window, and even then sales remain vitally important. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta are probably the two most attractive options right now.",
      "Nevertheless, the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha show that United want players with Premier League pedigree."

      "Barcelona have sent a message to Marcus Rashford after the Manchester United forward made his debut for the Catalan giants at the weekend.",
      "The La Liga champions will be footing the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save United around £12million. Barca also have the option to make his move to Catalonia permanent.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he now has his dream transfer to Barcelona after spending the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "And the 27-year-old made his debut for Barca over the weekend, featuring briefly in a pre-season clash against Japanese side Vissel Kobe. Rashford replaced Raphinha at half-time, playing just 33 minutes before being substituted for Pedro Fernaandez.",
      "The Reds academy graduate has since reacted on Instagram after the match. \"First minutes in a Barca shirt! Vamos,\" he wrote, followed by blue and red love heart emojis.",
      "And his new employers have since reacted to the post with a simple, two-word message of their own. Commenting on the post, the club's official Instagram account replied: \"Welcome Rashy\", in Catalan, alongside the same emojis.",
      "Rashford found himself on the hunt for a new club this summer after Villa opted not to offer a permanent deal, while the striker was eager to return to Champions League football. Despite scoring just six times in the Premier League last season, Rashford managed to regain some form during his time in Birmingham, earning him his first England call-up since March 2024 under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "In his quest for a move to Barcelona this summer, Rashford turned to the AC Talent agency, renowned for its list of Spanish clients. The Catalans have been heavily linked with Rashford - and a move to La Liga has brought an end to his late-afternoon solo training sessions at Carrington.",
      "Tensions flared between head coach Ruben Amorim and Rashford in mid-December when the academy graduate was left out of the squad for the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium. Rashford's final appearance for United was against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on December 12.",

      "Manchester United are in desperate need of a new striker as they weigh up a move for Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The Reds are in dire need of a reliable goalscorer, having scored a mere 44 goals in the top-flight last season, their lowest tally in the Premier League era. After splashing out on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, United will need to offload players to fund further purchases.",
      "And the Reds have identified Aston Villa's Watkins as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Sesko probably has more potential but will almost certainly be more expensive. With United also needing a new midfielder - Watkins is the better option for where the Reds currently are.",
      "United have no European football and are poised for another transition season, so he is the perfect short-term solution for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Villa's striker might not take United to their ultimate aim of a league title or Champions League win, but he's the perfect stepping stone for where they currently are.",
      "Considering how United have already operated in this summer's transfer window, it would certainly make more sense for the Premier League proven striker to be signed.",
      "Going all-in for Sesko would be somewhat of a risk as he is still somewhat raw but his potential appears limitless. In Watkins, it is very clear that for the next four to five years, a consistent goal-scorer would be coming into the club but beyond that, it seems likely a new striker would have to come in.",
      "Despite the RB Leipzig forward having the tools to potentially be United's main man for the next decade or so, United are really not in a position to take a risk on another young striker and therefore it makes much more sense to make a move for Watkins.",
      "In this situation you would usually see me opt for the proven Premier League player, but I’m going to take a different stance here.",
      "I think Sesko would be the better signing for United, and while he will probably be more expensive it’s a more long-term solution to the striker conundrum currently plaguing United.",
      "A price of £45 million has been mentioned for Watkins, while Sesko would cost around £69 million. Although still in his prime, Watkins is 30 this year. Sesko, on the other hand, is just 22-years-old and has the potential to be a long-term solution for United.",
      "Spending out on Watkins now could mean that maybe in three years, United face another search and therefore another big transfer fee.",
      "While it is more of a risk, spending bigger now on Sesko could offer a longer-term solution for Ruben Amorim that the club could be thankful for over the next few years.",
      "There was a time when United would have been able to pluck both of these players from their clubs with relative ease. If they have to only settle for one, they have to look at who is the most likely to bring them success at a faster rate.",
      "Watkins stands out, therefore, as the senior option with a track record of deadly Premier League performances. He would be able to hit the ground running with Cunha and Mbeumo operating in support.",
      "Though there must be caution taken at the same time. Watkins is 29 so if Villa do demand too high a fee, United must have their own threshold in mind to say to themselves that it would be more financially viable to turn to Sesko instead and make him their long-term striker project in this Amorim team.",
      "I simply can't see how United can afford to sign Benjamin Sesko. Arsenal backing out of negotiations with RB Leipzig, despite the Slovenia international being their preferred target, says it all.",
      "The Gunners turning their attention to Viktor Gyokeres should speak volumes about how attainable Sesko is this summer. I can't see Leipzig agreeing to a favourable deal financially like Wolverhampton Wanderers did for Matheus Cunha.",
      "As such, of the two, seemingly only one option exists given the financial situation United find themselves in, especially after their outlay on Bryan Mbeumo. Ollie Watkins would presumably be available at a lower price, but arguably worse value due to the difference in age between the two strikers.",

      "Too many of Manchester United's recent superstar signings have failed to live up to the mark.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in typically Zlatan Ibrahimovic style, was different. He arrived at Old Trafford in 2016, announcing his move on social media 24 hours before an official statement. He was in the twilight of his career but plundered 29 goals in 43 starts, helping United win the Europa League, albeit he missed the final through injury, and the League Cup, in which he scored twice as the Reds beat Southampton.",
      "Benjamin Sesko would have taken note. The Slovenia superstar is being linked with a move to United and the prospect of him following in Ibrahimovic's footsteps is one that would excite both Sesko and Reds supporters.",
      "The 22-year-old has forged a reputation as one of Europe's leading goalscorers in recent seasons, transferring the form he showed breaking through at Red Bull Salzburg to the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig. United were first linked with a move for Sesko two years ago and speculation he could join this summer has ramped up in recent days.",
      "He was nothing more than a promising junior when Ibrahimovic was strutting his stuff at Old Trafford but a young Sesko, who is a keen basketball fan and was initially pressed into football as a goalkeeper by his dad, himself a former stopper, before becoming a forward, was enthralled by the Swedish superstar.",
      "“Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol,” he said in an interview in 2023. “I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.”",
      "One of those videos will likely have been the League Cup win in 2017 when Ibrahimovic netted a late winner to hand United the trophy. Sesko has spoken of an interest in playing in the Premier League: \"Of course it would be nice to play there,\" he mused shortly after signing for Leipzig.",
      "His stock has risen considerably since and it's easy to see why. Sesko is a towering forward with an eye for goal, aerial ability, and a thunderous strike, but he offers much more than 'the big man up top'.",
      "He is a willing channel runner, often retreats into midfield to pick up the ball and progress play while his dribbling ability makes him a danger from deep.",
      "He has 27 goals in 47 league starts for Leipzig, numbers that provide a belief he could cut it in the Premier League. And at United, as a focal point of an attack and with a new-look creative force behind him, he could thrive.",
      "If United were able to complete a deal for Sesko, it would significantly enhance a squad that has struggled for goals in the past two seasons and potentially provide a long-term solution.",
      "In his first interview as a Red, Ibrahmiovic said: \"I don't like to compare the past with the present.\"",
      "In Sesko, United would get a reminder of the past with a bright future ahead.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to leave Manchester United on loan this summer.",
      "Collyer made his United debut in the Community Shield against Manchester City last year but he has only started three times for the club.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders available to head coach Ruben Amorim and United's intention to facilitate a loan move for Collyer is expected to clear the pathway for a midfield signing.",
      "Collyer joined the United academy from Brighton in 2022 and he signed a new contract last summer. However, he missed 28 games through three separate injuries last season and managed only 13 appearances.",
      "Sources say Collyer \"has to go on loan\" for the benefit of his development and United are planning to okay a move, despite Collyer's determination to challenge for a place.",
      "\"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" Collyer said. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.",

      "Collyer had interest from Brentford and Chelsea before he opted to sign for United in early 2022 and he is under contract at the club until 2027, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Erik ten Hag made a beeline for Collyer after United won the 2024 FA Cup and the Dutchman insisted on attending the midfielder's contract signing ceremony last summer.",
      "Collyer came on for United against City, Liverpool and Arsenal in his first full season at the club, having been an unused substitute on eight occasions in 2023-24.",
      "The academy graduate started the 0-0 draw with Leeds United last week as one of the two playmakers behind striker Chido Obi, a first for Collyer in coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "\"I think he's trying out new things,\" Collyer added. \"Obviously he had an idea. I've got quite good legs on the pitch and then I think halfway through me and Amad swapped. It's the manager (who decided that). I'll do whatever he wants me to do.",
      "\"Obviously the manager knows what he's doing. He's got his reason for doing things. Obviously last season, like I said previously, I had quite a few injuries so he could be looking at it that he doesn't want to overcook me in a way like that. So the manager knows what he's doing.\"",

      "It was on Sunday when Rashford made his first appearance for Barcelona in a friendly match against Vissel Kobe in Japan. Rashford was introduced at half time before being substituted in the 78th minute.",
      "After the game, which Barcelona won 3-1, Rashford took to social media to post a message about his debut. The on-loan United star posted to his 19.4million followers on Instagram several photos from his cameo in Japan, accompanied with the caption: \"First minutes in a Barca shirt! Vamos.\"",
      "The post has since received more than 1.7million likes, including several from United stars past and present. Joshua Zirkzee, Bruno Fernandes, Antony, Diogo Dalot, Tyrell Malacia, Harry Maguire and Rasmus Hojlund all liked the post from Rashford.",
      "Rashford's post also received some likes from former United players, including Juan Mata, David De Gea, Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Christian Eriksen.",
      "There were some questions after Barca's win over Vissel Kobe as to why Rashford was only on the pitch for 33 minutes. Manager Hansi Flick explained that the on-loan United star's fitness was the reason for Rashford's minutes being managed.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others,\" he said. \"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us.\"",

      "Yes, Ruben Amorim's first season in charge won't be judged on a pre-season win over West Ham United during a tour of the USA, but there were plenty of positives to emerge from their outing at the New York Giants' Met Life Stadium.",
      "Their performance would have pleased Amorim and so too would the two-goal contribution from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Too often United had to rely on the brilliance of their skipper to pull them out of trouble and that was signified by the fact he scored 19 goals and registered 18 assists in one of United's most forgettable seasons for decades.",
      "If United are going to get back to the top, they need their captain to maintain that brilliant form this season. The key is for others to step up with meaningful contributions of their own.",
      "However, it had been though that Fernandes would be used in a deeper central midfield role this season, having largely impressed as one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders in his 3-4-2-1 formation last term.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had been tipped to take those two roles this season but in the absence of Mbuemo, Fernandes lined up alongside Cunha in a more advanced role.",
      "And he showed his qualities, linking up with the Brazil international well, and offering Amorim some food for thought - particularly given Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo played well together at the base of midfield.",
      "Mbeumo will be introduced to the side in the coming days and weeks and it will be interesting to see what that means for Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal international has always offered versatility in where he is used in midfield and it is hard to imagine United won't team up Mbeumo and Cunha, who scored 37 goals between them last term, in the more advanced midfield roles.",
      "But Fernandes sent a timely reminder of what he can do there and with Mason Mount and Amad also options that can be used in those roles, Amorim suddenly has a number of options at his disposal.",
      "If the deeper Fernandes experiment doesn't work, Amorim won't hesitate to change his plan.",

      "Ruben Amorim made no changes at the break and United started the second half as they did the first. Fernandes should have doubled his tally but was denied by Alphonse Areola, but there was nothing the West Ham goalkeeper could do to stop the United captain doubling his side’s lead with a superb curling effort just minutes later.",

      "Looked comfortable back in midfield alongside Manuel Ugarte and was quietly effective during his 65 minutes. 7",

      "Amorim was asked about his new signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while out on the tour of the US, and said: “They are really humble. They know how to fit into a group, they don’t act like stars.",
      "\"They also understand that this is not the moment to want to be a star. They are team players at the same time. But it's not just what they give to the team, it's the way they make the feel with their teammates, so they are improving this team in every aspect.\"",
      "Amorim produced that answer during an interview with MUTV ahead of Manchester United's game against West Ham in New Jersey. The clip has gained some traction, but a lot of supporters won't have seen it.",
      "United's head coach is a good communicator. His comments could be taken at face value, but it felt like he was sending a message to the players who have crossed him at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both dropped for the Manchester derby in December. Rashford recently moved to Barcelona on loan and Garnacho is set to leave.",
      "Amorim outlined his vision for the dressing room when he appeared to have a dig at Rashford and Garnacho during his interview in the States. The United head coach wants elite players and stars in the dressing room - just not at the expense of the team.",
      "Building a healthy culture is crucial to building a successful team and Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room, which is why Rashford and Garnacho have been kicked out.",
      "Erik ten Hag improved standards during his two-and-a-half-year reign and took on Cristiano Ronaldo. Amorim isn't stupid and has quickly decided Rashford and Garnacho cannot be part of his squad.",

      "Amorim has moved on with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. The 40-year-old is delighted with United's new additions because they are brilliant players with the character needed to thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "United don't have room in their squad for players who criticise the manager's section calls or walk straight down the tunnel after being substituted.",

      "Having excelled under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, many believed it was inevitable he would end up reuniting with him in M16.",

      "With just three weeks to go until the start of the new Premier League season, time is running out for United to find the goalscorer they are looking for.",
      "Although Amorim has publicly said he would be \"happy\" to start the season without a new striker at the tip of his attack, the feeling is probably different behind closed doors.",
      "Having spent more than £120million on Cunha and Mbeumo, United need to raise funds via player sales to continue their recruitment drive. The aforementioned duo are statement signings and United will want a No.9 of the same mould.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United have been chasing shadows in their striker search. They have been linked with countless names but they are still waiting to make a breakthrough.",
      "If United are to follow the same blueprint in their search for a striker that led them to Mbeumo and Cunha, they are likely to target a goalscorer with Premier League pedigree. However, Premier League proven strikers are not cheap.",
      "However, in a summer in which failing to sign a striker will be costly, United might not be left with any choice but to loosen their purse strings one last time.",
      "If that proves to be the case, they should be setting their sights on Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. He enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, helping Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "The 28-year-old was one of the best strikers in the Premier League last term, scoring 14 league goals, two of which were scored against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Frenchman has made solid progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz, initially on loan, four-and-a-half years ago, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he required time to adapt, so much so it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to consistently show his class.",
      "Scoring 19 times in 2023/24, Mateta has scored 36 goals in the last two seasons for Palace. Of those 36 goals, 30 were plundered in the Premier League, meaning he has an established record in England's top flight.",
      "Mateta ticks plenty of boxes. He is a defender's worst nightmare, both with the ball at his feet and in the air.",
      "After Palace triggered the 12-month option in his contract last December to extend his stay at Selhurst Park until June 2027, they have ensured they have protected his value. His deal was originally due to expire next June.",
      "Despite that, Palace may be mindful that this summer could represent their last chance to get the best possible price for their chief goal-getter.",
      "If they fail to tie him down to a new deal within the next 12 months, clubs will try and land him for a cut-price fee next summer amid the fact he will have just one year left on his contract.",
      "Palace will be accounting for plenty of factors this summer, and keeping Mateta will be a priority for them. He is their main striker and losing him would be a massive blow.",
      "But as United have demonstrated with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo, they still have plenty of pulling power. Palace's demotion to the Europa Conference League from the Europa League could also play into United's hands.",
      "There is no denying Mateta will cost a hefty fee this summer, but Palace might be prepared to negotiate amid the possibility their grip on his future this time next year could be weaker.",

      "MEN Sport says: United have been linked with several strikers already this summer, and Kolo Muani is one of the players credited as a potential target in recent weeks. Only time will tell if United will make an active attempt to sign Kolo Muani, but it seems that they may find it difficult to fend off competition from Juventus.",

Leipzig still asking for €80m+. #MUFC face competition from Newcastle, who are currently more advanced in discussions. Both clubs hoping the price drops closer to €70m.",

      "‘Donnarumma earns €7 million net salary plus €3 million in bonuses, but the club’s offer didn’t satisfy him. He has decided not to renew his deal, and with only one year left on his contract, PSG have decided to sell him this summer.’",
      "Now, Flashscore claim PSG have ‘moved forward’ with plans to replace him with Lille’s Lucas Chevalier, while Fabrizio Romano revealed on Tuesday morning that his move to the Champions League holders is close.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Paris Saint-Germain are at final stages of Lucas Chevalier deal, here we go soon!",
      "‘€40m [£35m] deal being sorted directly between presidents Al Khelaifi and Letang as Lille ask for more add-ons, but very close. Chevalier accepted a five year deal last week.’",
      "As for Donnarumma, Man Utd have a ‘real chance’ of landing him, but Flashscore point out that they are currently ‘stuck’ as they are at ‘full capacity’ and a loan is ‘more realistic.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Their failure to offload Andre Onana means there is no clear pathway to bring in another top-tier goalkeeper. The idea of carrying two premium-salaried, permanent stoppers was dismissed internally earlier this summer and reversing that stance now would mean tearing up their transfer plan.",
      "‘There was also hope that Altay Bayindir would move on to free up a squad spot, but interest in the Turkish international has been limited. United are currently at capacity in the goalkeeper department and are actively working out how to reshape things before they can commit to anything.’",

      "Manchester United have whittled their striker shortlist down to two – which could spell further bad news for Newcastle…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Jackson is off Man Utd’s list because of the anticipated costs involved. Which Chelsea won’t compromise on if they know Newcastle have an Isak-sized windfall on the way.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "17) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "16) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "15) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly.",
      "",
      "13) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "12) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But now here come Man Utd. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "6) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who is waiting for a Premier League club to spare him once again from playing in the Championship.",
      "",
      "5)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "4) Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked to be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, is already in Wearside for a medical.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Joao Felix – Chelsea to Saudi\nChelsea, owned by Clearlake Capital with whom PIF have billions invested, are selling a player we’d almost all forgotten still plays for them to Al-Nassr for around £44million. That’s convenient for everyone, isn’t it? Unsurprisingly, this is going through quickly, with Felix already in Saudi.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nThe Colombian is now in Bavaria to undergo a medical after a fee of £65million was agreed. There’s half the Isak money…",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect. A medical was due to begin on Monday so we expect confirmation in the coming days."

      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have so far brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively as their two big signings, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "It has been claimed that Man Utd still want three new signings this summer with a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper taking priority.",
      "Only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Man Utd last season as Amorim’s outfit had a campaign to forget, finishing 15th in the table.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund came in for lots of stick with the duo only managing to score seven Premier League goals between them last term.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with numerous strikers over the summer with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen a couple of the early names bandied about.",
      "READ: Chelsea and Liverpool dominate top 10 genius Premier League player sales this summer",
      "However, The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has revealed that Man Utd have now whittled their striker hit list down to just two names this summer.",
      "Whitwell wrote: ‘Manchester United have narrowed their striker search down to two names — Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "‘They had been exploring a deal for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, but have ruled out a move due to the cost. United had held back from Sesko due to the finances required, but talks have now taken place to establish some details around a potential move. The same has occurred for a Watkins deal.’",
      "After seeing a loan bid rejected by Aston Villa, The Athletic adds that Man Utd are ‘effectively ruling out a move’ for Emiliano Martinez as ‘he can only leave on a permanent deal’ with ‘no sign Andre Onana will go’.",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham reckons it’s for the best if Onana leaves Old Trafford this summer after his performances received criticism las term.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “When you talk about goalkeepers, it’s a specialised position and there’s a lot of pressure there. There’s talk about Andre Onana leaving, and I think it’s best if he does.",
      "“He’s made a lot of mistakes – yes, he’s made some outstanding and unorthodox saves, but when you make so many mistakes and a lot of goals seem to be down to you, it’s best that the pressure is relieved, not only on Manchester United but on him as well.",
      "“He needs to have a different start somewhere else, because he’s obviously a decent goalkeeper.”",
      "Sheringham insists that Man Utd must sell players, whatever the cost this summer, he added: “It’s very easy to spend money on players, but it’s hard to recoup it. It seems quiet, but I bet there’s lots going on behind the scenes at Manchester United. Other clubs know United’s position.",
      "“They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers. I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment.",
      "“The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it. They’ll probably take anything from a quarter to a fifth of their asking price for some of them.”",
      "A diabolical transfer window for Newcastle will get worse when they miss out on Benjamin Sesko and Yoane Wissa before signing a Liverpool player for £50m.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is  ‘impressed’ by Man Utd’s ‘efforts’ to sign him ahead of Newcastle this summer as RB Leipzig’s asking price has been revealed.",
      "Man Utd have now made a ‘concrete’ ‘move’ to beat Newcastle to Sesko, according to Fabrizio Romano, with an ‘agreement in principle’ struck for the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Man Utd face a potential knockout blow in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle are the ‘most serious’ contenders, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has decided between a move to Man Utd or Newcastle as an ‘agreement in principle’ has been reached, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to discuss a potential deal to sign Benjamin Sesko in a meeting with Ruben Amorim next week, according to Fabrizio Romano."

      "While Manchester United scour Europe for someone, anyone willing to pay anything for their unwanted cast of very talented footballers they’ve decided they have no use for, other Premier League teams have shown themselves to be adept at selling players to balance their books and boost their summer spending sprees, with Chelsea proving to be the masters.",
      "The Blues have four player sales in this top 10, which includes transfers which have been agreed but not yet signed and sealed.",
      "",
      "10) Bashir Humphreys: Chelsea to Burnley, £10m\nThat’s £10m of pure profit for a left-back with a market value of £6m, who made two appearances for Chelsea and was never going to make another one.",
      "The cash has been immediately spent on teenage centre-back Mamadou Sarr, who started 27 games to help Strasbourg into the Conference League last season. As becomes clearer as you go down this page, Chelsea remain experts in filling their coffers.",
      "",
      "9) Djordje Petrovic: Chelsea to Bournemouth, £22m rising to £25m\nWe’re entirely ready to accept that Chelsea may have sold their best goalkeeper. That may be Petrovic, it may be Kepa Arrizabalaga. But for us they’re all equally sh*t, average and alright, depending on what mood we’re in, so they may as well make a £10m PSR-boosting profit on Petrovic and have Robert Sanchez feebly tending goal again with the identically inadequate Filip Jorgensen in reserve if they’re really actually not going to sign a decent option to match the progression of the rest of the squad.",
      "",
      "8) Lloyd Kelly: Newcastle to Juventus, £14.5m rising to £20m\nWe’re pleased for Kelly, who probably thought – as we did – that he would play more for Newcastle having made what looked like a decent move for both player and club last summer.",
      "But after starting three of the opening five games following his free transfer, Kelly featured for just 96 minutes in the next 19 games before sealing a loan exit to Juventus.",
      "And the key part he played for the Old Lady – nailing down a spot at the heart of their defence – suggests Newcastle may come to regret the obligation to buy that was enforced when a limited appearance-based condition was met. But without knowing the heights Kelly will reach in Serie A and beyond, Newcastle will currently be seeing this as a huge PSR win.",
      "",
      "7) Yan Couto: Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund, £21m rising to £25m\nCouto joins a list of 12 players, including Pedro Porro, Aaron Mooy, Jason Denayer, Jack Harrison and Douglas Luiz, that City have sold for a combined £113m having never made an appearance for club. Incredible.",
      "Maximo Peronne was also sold this summer, to Como for £11.2m, having featured for just 20 minutes in a City shirt.",
      "",
      "6) Anthony Elanga: Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, £52m rising to £55m\nNo other team in world football is paying that fee for Elanga. That definitely doesn’t mean it was wrong for Newcastle to pay it, before all of this Alexander Isak heartache it was the one area of the pitch where there was the biggest potential for improvement and he’s a very Eddie Howe player – direct, powerful and speedy.",
      "But Forest must have been a tad surprised when Newcastle returned with an extra £10m after seeing their initial £45m bid knocked back for the Swede. He’s valued at £36m and cost them under £20m.",
      "A penny for the thoughts of the Manchester United chief who opened the door to that sale to Forest in the summer of 2023 due to ‘reservations over Elanga’s ability to break down stubborn defences in a United team that had expectations to dominate possession during games’ before sacking that manager and hiring one whose modus operandi is dynamism in transition.",
      "Now we think about it, United are the second team in world football who would have paid that fee for Elanga had that move not required a hilarious and embarrassing climbdown.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford to Manchester United, £65m rising to £71m\nThere was a time when mid-table Premier League sides were bullied into letting their prized assets leave for Manchester United. As soon as they came calling, that was that, with a club the size of Brentford expected to kiss rings and bow in appreciation of the Red Devils bestowing such honour on them by being interested in one of their players.",
      "Not for the first time, nor we suspect the last, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Ineos lads played their hand way too early. Brentford weren’t happy that they approached Mbeumo first, and when the forward then made it clear he only wanted the move to Old Trafford despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, the Red Devils created a situation for themselves where they either had to meet Brentford’s demand – which didn’t change despite contrary reports pushed by United – or flounce away from their top target to the great enjoyment of the masses who feed on evidence that a once-great club is great no longer.",
      "They opted save face and were indeed ‘held to ransom’ despite Ratcliffe’s insistence that he wouldn’t be, paying some £18m over Mbeumo’s market value.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke: Chelsea to Arsenal, £48.5m rising to £50m\nIn our latest instalment of Both Things Can Be True, we see this as a good signing from Arsenal but also a very good sale by Chelsea. The Gunners wanted an option for both left and right wings, whose first thought is to take defenders on, at a good age with a high ceiling; Madueke is all those things.",
      "And while the logic in coaching a player, watching them improve and then selling them before seeing whether they can fulfil their potential in favour of someone at the onset of what will likely be a very similar journey in Jamie Gittens is at best questionable and at worst a sign that Chelsea as a football club aren’t actually all that interested in developing young talent but buying and selling them until they uncover ready-made gems, on the face of it they have made close to £20m on a forward who got 20 goals and nine assists in 92 appearances for them.",
      "",
      "3) Luis Diaz: Liverpool to Bayern Munich, £65.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox should take note. Weirdly, the best way to get the most amount of money for a footballer who wants to leave and you don’t particularly want at your football club for at least that reason and possibly others, isn’t to drop them to a bomb squad and announce to the world that you’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "The party line from Liverpool and Arne Slot for the majority of this transfer window, amid interest from Barcelona, Saudi Arabia and Bayen, was that they had ‘no plans’ to sell Diaz.",
      "They also had no plan to offer him an improved contract, and will therefore have known that Diaz would likely push for an exit. But he went on tour with Slot and his teammates, at least providing interested clubs with the illusion of a possible harmonious future at the club if they fail to up the ante.",
      "And Bayern did. After the Premier League champions rejected an opening bid of £58.6m from the Bundesliga giants, they’ve now accepted a £65.5m bid including add-ons, or 44% of an Alexander Isak, for a 28-year-old valued by Transfermarkt at £60m.",
      "",
      "2) Jarell Quansah: Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m rising to £35m\nWe have no way of finding this out/didn’t even try, but we posit that there has never been a greater transfer-fee-per-senior-start paid (yes, it’s a thing if we say so) than the £875,000 Bayer Leverkusen have spent on Quansah per appearance from the off under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Anfield.",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are admittedly a very good reason why Quansah’s not played all that much and it’s technically possible for the game time of the third best centre-back in the world to be limited in a similar manner.",
      "But he wouldn’t be in many people’s top 50 as things stand and that was just too delicious a chunk of pure profit to turn down, with the Reds also safe in the knowledge that they can buy him back for £50m should his progression be as impressive as many of us thought it may be a year or so ago.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Felix: Chelsea to Al Nassr, £26m rising to £44m\nThe guaranteed £26m fee brings the total spent by clubs acquiring what we don’t think anyone will disagree are Felix’s limited services to just over £180m.",
      "After bizarrely spending £44m to sign him from Atletico Madrid last summer after a hugely underwhelming loan spell at Stamford Bridge the season before, Chelsea are miraculously set to make all of that money back thanks to Al Nassr, and could actually be up on the deal having already banked close to £5m from his six-month loan spell at AC Milan.",
      "The Blues are also said to have wisely inserted a hefty sell-on clause into the deal with Al Nassr, as another wealthy football club thinking they can ‘fix’ Joao Felix is the third certainty after death and taxes.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "A list of 14 players could reportedly be made available by Chelsea this summer, with some big names expected to be surplus to requirements.",
      "Leeds United will stay in the Premier League if they sign a ‘new Raphinha’. Simple enough, right? We’ve created a ten-player shortlist for Daniel Farke.",
      "Former AC Milan and Chelsea great Marcel Desailly has seen plenty of Joao Felix over his itinerant career and feels he just still hasn’t ‘found his place’",
      "A new report has revealed ‘eleven’ Chelsea players are set to be sold this summer as club chiefs are looking to raise funds for a ‘super signing’."

The Foxes built on consecutive finishes of 9th with Maguire in the side to produce back-to-back Champions League qualification challenges without him, ultimately coming 5th both times.",

      "The mere thought of a Sean Longstaff-Scott McTominay central midfield was enough to drive supporters to the point of impotent fury in 2019; by 2025 the former is the secret to survival for Leeds and the latter is Naples royalty.",

The foundations for relegation were established."

      "Benjamin Sesko is ‘impressed’ by Manchester United’s ‘efforts’ to sign him ahead of Newcastle this summer as RB Leipzig’s asking price has been revealed.",
      "Sesko is open to leaving the Bundesliga side this summer after they failed to qualify for the Champions League and after Arsenal plumped for Viktor Gyokeres despite interest in the Slovenian, Newcastle and Manchester United are now vying for his signature.",
      "United want a new striker after both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to impress last season, while the Magpies are looking for a replacement for Liverpool-bound Alexander Isak after the Sweden international dropped his bombshell desire to leave the club on Thursday.",
      "After reporting that Newcastle had ‘opened’ talks with RB Leipzig over a deal for Sesko last week, journalist Nicola Schira claimed on Sunday evening that the Magpies have ‘an agreement in principle’ with the Slovenia striker.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘Benjamin Sesko has an agreement in principle with Newcastle for a contract until 2030. NUFC are now working to reach a deal with Leipzig.’",
      "But German journalist Guido Schafer insists that Sesko has given his preference to join United over Newcastle this summer, and Romano said on his YouTube channel on Monday that the Red Devils are ‘starting to move’ for the striker, with ‘concrete conversations’ being held over his transfer.",
      "He said: “For Sesko, Newcastle are ready to make something big but don’t forget also Man United. Man United have been discussing internally for days about strikers – Ollie Watkins but Aston Villa insist on keeping the player…Sesko but obviously financially it is not an easy deal.",
      "“But Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko’s camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision.",

So Newcastle are ready to make a very important proposal to Sesko and Leipzig. Man United have started the concrete conversation while they discussed his name internally for weeks.”",
      "And now Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg claims Sesko is ‘impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him’.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Manchester United are not giving up on Benjamin #Sesko. As revealed today, #MUFC have presented the player with clear figures and their project. Sesko is impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him.",
      "‘However: Newcastle are fully in the race and not backing down. An offer is ready to be submitted at any time. Leipzig are now demanding at least €80 million.’",
      "United boss Amorim insists any player who joins the club this summer will need to be fully invested in his project.",
      "He told the club’s media channels: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it’s an important time in our club.”",
      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",

      "These disappointments have forced United to turn to potential alternatives and Jackson has been mentioned as an option. It has been claimed that Chelsea could cash in on the forward, who is likely to be behind Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in the pecking order if he stays at Stamford Bridge.",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Chelsea want as much as £80m for Jackson this summer, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming the striker’s “temperament” and United’s ability to get “better players for the money” are the two reasons for INEOS’ ‘transfer decision’ on this potential signing.",

      "“If Chelsea are looking to get rid of him, that tells you whether he’s good enough for United.",

      "Former Premier League winger Jermaine Pennant also claims Man Utd should look past Jackson, who would suit a move to Brighton.",
      "“I’m not sure if Nicolas Jackson is the man for a top team as we’ve seen during his time at Chelsea. It’s an interesting one to see where he goes if he leaves the club. He’s in the Darwin Nunez bracket for me – he gets loads of chances, but he isn’t prolific,” Pennant said.",
      "“If I were him, I’d look a little below that level – someone like Brighton. I think that could work because he’d do well there – they should be looking at him.",
      "“Manchester United are linked but I’m not too sure that’s the right move for the club – it could be another Rasmus Hojlund situation. He obviously believes in himself and thinks he should be at a top team, but I can’t see him being the number one for a top six side.”",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim’s ‘decision’ on Rasmus Hojlund has reportedly sparked his desire to ‘return to his former club’.",
      "Hojlund joined the Red Devils for around £64m plus add-ons during the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "The 22-year-old was signed as an alternative to Harry Kane and he was put in a difficult position in his debut season as in the absence of injured Anthony Martial, he spent most of the campaign as United‘s only fit striker.",
      "Hojlund impressively surpassed expectations in 2023/24 as he scored 16 goals in all competitions, but he was heavily criticised for his poor form last season as he suffered a dramatic decline and only scored four Premier League goals.",
      "The Denmark international was devoid of confidence for most of the 2024/25 campaign as he struggled to do the basics and recent reports have suggested that they could offload him this summer.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have spent around £130m to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, with the signing of a new striker a priority for the remainder of this transfer window.",
      "READ: Sesko ‘agreement in principle’ struck as striker chooses between Man Utd and Newcastle",
      "However, Man Utd are having to consider alternatives after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, while they arguably need exits to raise funds.",
      "Reports have suggested that Hojlund could make way for a replacement after Joshua Zirkzee outshone his teammate in 2024/25 to arguably move ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Now, Caught Offside claims Amorim’s ‘decision’ on Hojlund has opened the exit door as he reckons the forward is ‘expendable’ and the head coach is also ‘prioritising new options’.",
      "Therefore, Hojlund is ‘increasingly likely to depart’ Man Utd this summer and while Juventus and Inter Milan have been linked with him, he ‘wants to return to former club’ Atalanta.",
      "Regarding the potential structure of a deal, the report claims:",
      "‘Serie A remains the most likely destination. Atalanta, where Hojlund first made his mark, are looking to reunite with the attacker.",
      "‘United are open to structured deals, initially loaning out Hojlund with an obligation to buy option included in the deal. The Premier League giants are also willing to cover part of Hojlund’s salary to facilitate his exit.’",
      "It is also claimed that this move could be a ‘masterstroke’ as it would afford Hojlund a ‘starting role and clear pathway back to form’ in ‘familiar’ surroundings.",
      "Man Utd have made an ‘initial offer’ to sign Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand, who wants to work with Ruben Amorim again, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could use Rasmus Hojlund to ‘compensate’ Juventus if they beat them to Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to discuss a potential deal to sign Benjamin Sesko in a meeting with Ruben Amorim next week, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "We’ve analysed the Man Utd first-team squad and decided who should be kept, sold, or loaned out before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have set a deadline to offload Alejandro Garnacho following fresh ‘private talks’ over his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer."

      "Before he added on Monday: ‘Al Nassr and Chelsea have signed all documents for João Félix permanent deal. João, completing medical today and then signing a two year deal at the club.’",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen has told Antony to push to stay at Real Betis next season after enjoying his spell in Spain.",
      "Meulensteen said in April: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked out their ‘next big target’ after landing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "So far this summer, the Red Devils have only managed to make three signings as they have spent around £130m to sign Mbeumo, Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim would presumably have liked to have more players through the door by now, but a lack of outgoing players has impacted United’s transfer plans.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the only member of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ to leave this summer as he has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy, while Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are great signings, but Man Utd still need upgrades in various positions. Recent reports have indicated that their next priorities are to sign a goalkeeper and a striker.",
      "READ: Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony",
      "United are understood to be in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana suffered a dramatic decline during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Onana became a liability last season and there are better goalkeepers available, with recent reports claiming the Red Devils are plotting an audacious move for PSG star Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The 26-year-old is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he sparkled for PSG as they won the Champions League in 2024/25, but his future is in doubt as he has entered the final year of his current contract.",
      "Last week, a report from Caught Offside claimed PSG will sell Donnarumma this summer as they are yet to come to terms on a new deal.",
      "The report revealed:",
      "‘Sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Gianluigi Donnarumma is one of the top names on Manchester United’s shortlist.",
      "‘PSG have been negotiating with him for over a year on a new contract. Donnarumma earns €7 million net salary plus €3 million in bonuses, but the club’s offer didn’t satisfy him. He has decided not to renew his deal, and with only one year left on his contract, PSG have decided to sell him this summer.’",
      "Now, Caught Offside have added that United have decided to make a new goalkeeper their ‘next big target’ and while Porto’s Diogo Costa remains an option, Donnarumma is a ‘coveted prize’ on their ‘shortlist’.",
      "It is claimed that this move will hinge on Onana leaving, while PSG have Lille star Lucas Chevalier ‘successor lined up’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘United have placed a price tag of £35-40 million on the Cameroonian international, and there is growing openness to his sale. Clubs in capitals such as AS Monaco and Saudi Arabia have shown interest, though Onana’s decision will significantly impact the final outcome.",

      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Next week will be important, very important for the future of Benjamin Sesko. Newcastle are going very big with a contract proposal ready for the player and they are also ready to approach RB Leipzig. Newcastle are going very strong and are prepared to make important things happen for the Slovenian striker. They will go big next week.",
      "READ: Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony",
      "“Manchester United are still discussing Benjamin Sesko internally. It is an expensive deal, so it is not easy, but don’t forget the gentleman’s agreement I told you. For some clubs, indicated by Benjamin Sesko as ‘special clubs’ for him, the price of the package can be €70m to €80m fixed, €5m to €10m in add-ons. It can be an important factor.",
      "“With Newcastle going very big and Manchester United discussing strikers and Sesko internally. Keep an eye on this story in the next week, in the next days. Newcastle will go with a big proposal, Manchester United will discuss his name again with the coach involved in the conversation, with the directors to see if they can make it happen or not.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils would be better off with a more experienced striker than Sesko after their struggles with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Ferdinand explained on his YouTube channel: “I think you’ve got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man Utd. That’s what I said about a number nine. I’m not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I’m saying Man Utd need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "“They’ve got Hojlund, they’ve got Zirkzee, they’ve got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine.’ That’s how you do it. When you’re going to buy somebody who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?”",
      "After taking Mbuemo off Brentford’s hands in the summer, The Sun now claim that Man Utd could ‘hijack’ the Bees’ deal to sign young Metz forward Idrissa Gueye.",

      "The report adds: ‘Brentford can offer Gueye a chance at early Premier League football, while United only see him as a long-term project.’",
      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",

      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",
