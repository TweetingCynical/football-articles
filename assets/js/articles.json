      "Cristiano Ronaldo could soon expand his brand into the UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly looking to expand his brand into the UK. The 41‑year‑old, who plays for Al‑Nassr in Saudi Arabia, is said to be keen on bringing his hotel and bar ventures to Britain.",
      "The Manchester United hero partnered with Portuguese hotel chain Pestana in 2016 to launch a series of CR7‑branded hotels and bars. He owns CR7‑branded hotels in Madrid, Funchal, Lisbon, Marrakech and New York.",
      "The Sun claims that the partnership, which runs Inverse by Pestana CR7 venues across Portugal, has applied to register the trademark in the UK. The report adds that Ronaldo, who remains hugely popular in Manchester, recognises the strong market for him in the city should he choose to open a bar or hotel there.",

      "His former United team‑mate Gary Neville already runs Hotel Football, situated in the shadow of Old Trafford. Although there is no indication he plans to retire soon, those close to him reportedly believe his increasingly assertive commercial strategy suggests he is preparing for life after football.",
      "General view of the new Pestana CR7 in Funchal, Madeira",
      "Despite already boasting a fortune worth hundreds of millions, he continues to expand his portfolio across fashion, fitness and hospitality. Ronaldo's net worth has been estimated at £1.04 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks the world ’s wealthiest individuals.",
      "His valuation factors in career earnings, investments and endorsements, with Bloomberg estimating that his salary income between 2002 and 2023 exceeded £410 million. His move to Saudi Pro League side Al‑Nassr in 2022 saw him sign a reported annual salary worth £177 million, and he has since agreed a new deal keeping him at the club until 2027.",
      "He also earns £13.4 million a year through his sponsorship agreement with Nike. Ronaldo recently went on strike at Al-Nassr.",
      "The 41-year-old sat out of matches against Al-Ittihad and Al-Riyadh as a way of making his feelings clear to Al-Nassr, the Pro League and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). He has been furious over a lack of transfer activity at the club, as well as the diminished influence of his allies, chief executive Jose Semedo and the director of football Simão Coutinho.",

While his former United teammate, Michael Carrick, has made an excellent start as interim boss, Ferdinand has his sights set on former Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi, who reportedly held secret talks with the club in 2024 before taking charge of Marseille.",
      "Ferdinand spoke of his respect for the Italian in January as he discussed who should replace the sacked Ruben Amorim. Speaking on his Presents podcast, he said: \"Someone who's free right now; not free [but] someone who's gettable.",
      "\"More than someone like [Thomas] Tuchel, because Tuchel would be one of my biggest picks as well, is De Zerbi. I'm telling you. Any formation he wants to play, the guy is a proper coach who gets players working and playing.\"",
      "While Tuchel looks out of reach after extending his England contract, De Zerbi is even more gettable now after leaving Marseille giants by mutual consent following reports he had fallen out with senior players, who allegedly weren't happy with his coaching methods and strict approach.",

      "Marseille, who sit fourth and 12 points adrift of PSG and have already been eliminated from this season's Champions League, said in a statement: \"Following discussions between all stakeholders in the club’s management - the owner, president, director of football, and coach - it was decided to make a change at the helm of the first team.",
      "\"This was a difficult collective decision, taken after careful consideration in the best interests of the club, in order to respond to the sporting challenges of the end of the season.\"",
      "De Zerbi is also said to have clashed with senior figures at previous clubs. Challenged on whether United need a confrontational boss, Ferdinand was unmoved, adding: \"I'd bring fire to the party, I'm telling you.",

      "United aren't the only club being linked with De Zerbi, who is also being touted for the Tottenham job following Thomas Frank's sacking. Spurs are set to appoint former Juventus boss Igor Tudor until the end of the season as they weigh up their next permanent appointment.",

      "Marcus Rashford is expected to leave Manchester United permanently for Barcelona in the summer(Image: Judit Cartiel, Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has already reversed a former manager's decision to sideline a player in the past, suggesting Marcus Rashford's Manchester United career could still have life in it. Carrick was appointed as United's interim head coach last month for the remainder of this season, replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.",
      "It's his second stint in such a role at Old Trafford, having previously served as caretaker manager for three matches following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal in November 2021. During that short period before Ralf Rangnick replaced him, Carrick overturned Solskjaer's decision to completely freeze out his former team-mate Phil Jones.",
      "The United legend reintegrated Jones into the first-team after a year out of the first-team picture. Carrick clearly recognised Jones's worth, taking the centre-back with the squad to Spain for a Champions League win over Villarreal, despite him being ineligible for selection. Jones went on to make his actual return to the pitch under Rangnick in January 2022.",

      "Such an unexpected comeback might offer a ray of hope to those United fans who still wish to see Rashford, currently on a season-long loan at Barcelona, come back to Manchester. Academy graduate Rashford's United career appeared over under Amorim after a bitter spat with the former head coach.",
      "He too was frozen out and hasn’t played for United since December 2024, having joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "On his return, Rashford was not allowed to train with the rest of the squad last summer as he eventually completed his loan move to Barcelona in July, losing his United No.10 squad number to Matheus Cunha. However, there remains a slim possibility that Carrick, should he be appointed permanently at the end of this season, might decide that he could still use Rashford’s talents.",
      "The 44-year-old worked with the England international for three-and-a-half years when he served as a first-team coach and later the caretaker manager, meaning he is fully aware of Rashford's abilities. The 28-year-old, who remains under contract at United until 2028, has 23 goal contributions in 34 matches for Barcelona this term.",
      "Michael Carrick brought Phil Jones back into the fray at United(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "It should be noted, however, that Carrick reportedly didn't consider bringing Rashford back during the January window, although that might be because his own future remains uncertain. As things stand, the former Middlesbrough manager's contract is still due to expire at the end of the current campaign.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are also reportedly preparing for Rashford's permanent departure in the forthcoming summer transfer window. Barcelona are prepared to pay the £26million buy option they negotiated with United for the forward last summer, which, even if Carrick takes over permanently, will spell the end of his career with his boyhood club.",

      "He said: “Obviously I don’t condone the language he used. I was born in this country of Nigerian descent and I think it’s ridiculous to say Great Britain has been colonised by immigrants because that is so far from the truth. I think it’s wrong.”",
      "In his apology, Ratcliffe said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\"",

      "They included former Rangers player John Brown, who insisted Butland was at least on a par with United's first-choice stoppers at the time.

      "Kai Rooney has already played at Old Trafford this season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Kai Rooney is eligible to make his Manchester United first-team debut this season - unlike fellow academy starlet JJ Gabriel. The 16-year-old – who is the son of Red Devils icon Wayne Rooney – recently impressed by scoring four goals in the Under‑16s' 6-4 victory over Norwich City in the Premier League Cup semi‑final.",
      "He's already made his debut for the Under-18s last year and has scored once in three appearances. Last month, he made his Old Trafford debut when coming on as a substitute in the Under-18s' 2-1 extra-time win over Derby County to book a place in the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Watched by his father and United interim boss Michael Carrick at the Theatre of Dreams, the teenager could potentially turn out at the legendary ground again this season - this time as part of the senior squad.",
      "Due to Premier League rules, players must be 15 years old when the 2025/26 season kicked off in August in order to feature for the first-team. Because Kai turned 15 in November 2024, he's legally allowed to play under Carrick, even though it appears highly unlikely this season at least.",
      "Unfortunately, the same can't be said for JJ Gabriel with regards to a possible United debut in the Premier League. The 15-year-old is regarded by many as United's biggest academy prospect and has already trained with the club's first-team under Ruben Amorim and Carrick.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Gabriel started in both of United's FA Youth Cup wins this season and played 115 minutes in the victory over Derby County, where he featured alongside the teenage Rooney. With 15 goals in 20 league games for United Under-18s this season, Gabriel has created huge excitement among those at the club.",
      "The youngster was eligible to play in the FA Cup as the Premier League age restrictions do not apply in the cup competition. However, United were knocked out of the tournament at home to Brighton as fellow teenager Shea Lacey made his FA Cup debut but was sent off for two yellow cards.",
      "JJ Gabriel, 15, has impressed greatly for Man Utd's U18 side(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher admitted that Gabriel has a \"bright future\" and detailed what he must do to reach his potential in football. \"JJ is a fantastic talent,\" the Scotsman said. \"I've enjoyed working with him immensely, getting to know him.",
      "\"He's a young lad with a massive sort of hype, you know there's a lot of noise around him and deservedly so because he's a real talented kid. He works hard. First thing I'd say is he loves football. He loves training, he loves playing, he loves having the ball, he loves expressing himself. He makes fantastic decisions.",
      "\"He's got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. 15-year-old, a bright future ahead of him. I'm super excited by his talent, but the most important thing is that he keeps developing, and he's in the U18s team, and he's doing fantastically well, but he's still got lots to learn.\"",

      "Barcelona will face no financial penalties if they decide against making Marcus Rashford's move permanent, it has been revealed. The England international is midway through his season-long loan at the Catalan club from Manchester United and has made a significant impact since his arrival.",
      "He has netted 10 goals and contributed 13 assists in all competitions, with Barca currently topping La Liga, just one point ahead of Real Madrid. The 28-year-old has already expressed his wish to remain at the Nou Camp on a permanent basis, with a return to Old Trafford this summer appearing unlikely.",
      "The Spanish club hold a £26million option to make the deal permanent, as sporting director Deco outlined the terms of his temporary arrangement. Speaking to SPORT, the former Chelsea and Portugal midfielder was questioned about whether Barcelona would incur a penalty clause if Rashford isn't signed permanently.",
      "He stated: \"No, it's a loan, and we have an option.\" When asked whether they intend to keep Rashford long term, Deco responded: \"Yes, definitely. I think it wasn't easy to come here. He has played at a very high level, with enormous demands at a club like Manchester United.",
      "\"Then he spent six months at Aston Villa, where he did a very good job. In fact, Aston Villa, they would have kept him if it had been possible. I know this because I've spoken to people there. But he only wanted to come to Barca, and that's a very positive thing.\"",
      "Deco lauded Rashford's decision to take a significant pay cut from his reported £325,000-a-week wages to secure a move to Barcelona. He stated: \"We were able to secure a loan. The fact that he took a pay cut to make it happen is a clear demonstration that he really wanted to come, and we're very happy about that.",

      "\"We have Ferran [Torres] and Rashford; we'll see what we can do to make decisions. If we're talking about the best striker, the best number 9 of the last ten years, it has been Robert [Lewandowski].",
      "Hansi Flick has spoken glowingly about Marcus Rashford(Image: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",

Perhaps Bayern Munich has a more traditional, target-figure striker. \"We have Ferran [Torres] and Rashford; we'll see what we can do to make decisions.",
      "\"If we're talking about the best striker, the best number 9 of the last ten years, it has been Robert [Lewandowski]. They prefer a striker with more mobility. There's no one with Robert's quality and his stats. Barca needs to look for players with technical ability, the capacity to link up with team-mates, and the ability to find solutions.\"",
      "Rashford's absence was keenly felt during Barcelona's crushing 4-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final on Thursday. The striker was sidelined for the match after picking up a knee injury during their 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday.",

Ratcliffe, the Manchester United part-owner, suggested this week that the United Kingdom had been \"colonised\" by immigrants, and while Barnes isn't happy with the use of that word, he welcomed debate.",
      "United fan organisations and politicians from a variety of parties have shared their own reactions to the billionaire's statements, while the Premier League club released a statement on Thursday. Barnes, who was born in Jamaica and relocated to England during his childhood, believes Ratcliffe is entitled to raise the topic, but took issue with Nigel Farage after the Reform UK leader's response.",
      "\"I have no issue with Jim Ratcliffe. I have no issue with his debate on immigration, that's a valid debate to be had,\" Barnes said on Good Morning Britain. \"Of course, immigration brings lots of good, and of course when he talks about illegal immigration, that has to be addressed... I agree with him on that.",

      "Ancelotti, 66, has been linked with the upcoming Old Trafford vacancy alongside 52-year-old Tuchel. United are yet to make a decision on who'll be in charge next season, with Michael Carrick currently at the wheel on an interim basis.",
      "Carrick's impressive start (four wins and one draw) has increased his chances of getting the job permanently, although the Red Devils are taking their time behind the scenes. But one man who won't be sitting in the Old Trafford hot seat is Ancelotti.",
      "The Athletic report that the former Real Madrid boss has agreed a new four-year contract with the Brazilian national team. Ancelotti was only appointed in May 2025 and hasn't taken charge of a major tournament.",

      "The Italian did lead Brazil to World Cup qualification and they've been drawn in a group alongside Morocco, Haiti and Scotland. Ancelotti seems to be enjoying his first job in international football - much like Tuchel.",
      "On Thursday, the FA announced that the ex-Chelsea manager had signed a two-year extension. Tuchel met with United chiefs in 2024 to discuss replacing Erik ten Hag, who ultimately wasn't sacked.",
      "Asked if he'd spoken to clubs this time around before choosing to stay with England beyond the World Cup, Tuchel replied: \"Confidential. But I was very committed to the idea after November to stay and the FA was as well.",

      "\"I was always committed to this idea of extending the contract, the FA were always committed - there were no games, no second thoughts. The process was very straightforward. There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football but not in the next two-and-a-half years.\"",
      "United are continuing to asses their options, with Roberto De Zerbi now freely available after leaving Marseille. Oliver Glasner has also confirmed that he'll leave Crystal Palace at the end of this season. But Carrick may well force the club's hand if he keeps up this rich vein of form.",

United co-owner Ratcliffe made headlines on Wednesday when he took aim at the level of migration in Britain and made false claims about the population.",
      "Ratcliffe, 73, is still suffering backlash, despite a mealy-mouthed apology which was demanded of him by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Also among those to criticise the billionaire were the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, various United supporters' groups and anti-racism charities.",
      "United took the unusual step of releasing a statement on Thursday. The club spoke of their pride at being an inclusive club with a 'diverse group of players' - but didn't mention Ratcliffe.",
      "According to the Mail, a portion of United's squad - which contains no fewer than 17 overseas players - have been left 'alarmed' by his comments. One insider warned that Ratcliffe's rant wouldn't go down well with the players while another source close to the dressing room accused him of being 'out of touch'.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Ratcliffe's comments came during a Sky News interview at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp. \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" the INEOS chief executive said.",
      "\"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"",

      "After a breakdown in relations with then-United boss Ruben Amorim, a second temporary departure from Old Trafford was arranged last summer. At the time, Rashford's future at United seemed close to finished, but Amorim's subsequent exit has reopened the possibility of a remarkable comeback.",

      "Jim Ratcliffe, the Manchester United co-owner and UK multibillionaire who prompted fury this week when he astonishingly claimed immigration was costing the country \"too much money\", has deprived the public purse of millions.",
      "Ratcliffe, 73, one of the UK's richest men, expressed his admiration for Nigel Farage and claimed the country was being \"colonised\" by immigrants in a shocking interview released this week that has seen him branded \"hypocritical\".",
      "The Sunday Times Rich List estimated he's worth a massive £17billion, and, alongside his part ownership of the Premier League club, he has mansions in London and Hampshire, and a £78million superyacht.",
      "But despite being financially stacked, the founder of chemical firm INEOS has gone to great lengths to hoard his wealth, including moving countries so he can pay less in tax.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been lambasted for his words(Image: Catherine Ivill - AMA, Getty Images)",
      "Mr Ratcliffe claimed this week that the UK \"can’t afford\" immigration and benefits, adding during an interview with Sky News: \"You can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.\"",
      "He also suggested: \"The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn’t it?” Ratcliffe, from Failsworth in Oldham, Manchester, trained as a chemical engineer and founded the INEOS chemicals group, now a multinational conglomerate, in 1998.",
      "In 2020, two years after he was knighted for \"services to business and investment\" he officially changed his tax residence, switching from Hampshire to Monaco.",
      "Monaco is a sovereign city state tax haven outside France where authorities do not levy taxes on income, wealth or property, and the deicision, at the time, was believed to have allowed Ratcliffe up to save up to £4 billion if he stayed there more than 183 days a year.",
      "He was previously one of the UK's biggest taxpayers, having contributed an estimated £110 million to the public purse between 2017 and 2018, placing him atop the Sunday Times Rich lists and fifth on the publication's Tax List. Ratcliffe doesn't appear on the tax list at all in 2026, but ranked seventh on the most recent Rich List, released in 2025.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe also controls Scotland's largest industrial site(Image: Getty Images)",
      "His continued presence on the list while suggesting the UK can't financially support people coming to the country has led people to accuse him of being a hypocrite.",
      "Among them was Sage Coulter, 30, a Manchester United fan of 13 years hailing from Florida who said his comments were \"inappropriate\" and \"hypocritical\". She told the BBC: \"It's sad to see that that is happening over here,\" Sage said. \"Immigrants are important.",
      "\"[Ratcliffe] lives in Monaco and doesn't pay UK taxes, so I mean, it's a bit ironic and hypocritical. It's all very hypocritical. How many immigrants play for United and other clubs?\"",
      "Manchester United would have been left with just three players on its starting lineup and two on its bench without its immigrant players, and the team said in a rare statement following Mr Ratcliffe's comments that it treasured its \"diverse group of players, staff, and global community of supporters\".",
      "A spokesperson said today: “Manchester United prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club,” a statement said. “Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.",

      "In another passage of play, Obi was sent through into the box, but he was flagged offside. The youngster's shoulders slumped, and Fletcher responded by shouting: \"Keep your head up, Chido.\"",
      "Fletcher encouraged Obi throughout the U18 Manchester derby. The striker's out-of-possession work has been identified as his biggest area for improvement, but he was excellent in that regard, pressing aggressively to help force a mistake from Harrison Miles for the opening goal.",
      "Click here to prioritise Manchester news in Google from the MEN",
      "Miles' heavy touch when attempting to play out from the back created an opportunity. Obi reacted quickly and pressured the ball, which led to JJ Gabriel picking it up and firing home.",
      "Obi needs to learn to love the ugly side of being a centre-forward to return to the first team set-up. The youngster loves to score goals, but there are other duties a striker must excel at to become the finished article.",
      "Gabriel broke the deadlock, and Obi was praised by his manager as he returned to the halfway line for the restart. Gabriel and Obi are a deadly partnership at U18 level. They both have the talent to reach the pinnacle of the game, but it's matches like Saturday's against City that will help them to develop.",

      "With seven minutes remaining, Obi got the reward for his diligent out-of-possession work when he gambled, as every striker should, by latching onto a long ball over the top of City's backline.",
      "In most cases, the ball probably would have been cleared, but Obi sniffed a potential opening and struck gold with a clinical finish. Fletcher looked delighted with him on the touchline.",
      "United were the short-priced favourites to see out the victory after Obi's goal. However, City produced an immediate response to halve the deficit through Tyrone Samba. The 18-year-old found the top corner from the edge of the box to set up a fascinating last few minutes of the academy Manchester derby.",
      "City's build-up became frantic as they chased a late equaliser. United soaked up the pressure and counter-attacked, which led to the Reds winning a free-kick around 20 yards out. Jim Thwaites was introduced to the game at half-time and confidently picked up the ball.",
      "The inevitable happened. Thwaites has already built a reputation in the academy as a dead-ball specialist, and the technique to find the top left from the right side of the box was exquisite.",
      "United won 3-1 to close the gap in the U18 North League table. City have been the pace-setters this season and are now a point ahead with three games in hand, but United's victory should provide the youngsters with hope that the title race could go down to the final day of the campaign.",
      "Fletcher was spotted deep in conversation with Michael Carrick after the final whistle. Carrick was present at City's academy to watch his son play in the Under-16 Manchester derby on the adjacent pitch.",

      "It looked like Carrick received a debrief from Fletcher about his team's superb performance. Carrick has shown a keen interest in the academy since his appointment as interim boss, unlike his predecessor, and his presence demonstrates that there is a pathway to the first team.",
      "Each of the goalscorers against City, Gabriel, Obi and Thwaites, have taken part in first-team training sessions at Carrington. Carrick will cast his eye on academy prospects for as long as he's in charge.",
      "It will be fascinating to see if Obi is involved in another Premier League squad before the end of the season. Obi has been included in just a single squad, against Wolves on December 30, and his hopes of further involvement have been dashed by early cup exits and very few first-team injuries.",
      "Obi only celebrated his 18th birthday in November and needs to \"keep his head up\".",

      "Manchester United U18s beat Manchester City 3-1 at the Academy Stadium on Saturday.",
      "An entertaining game saw JJ Gabriel open the scoring in the second half before Chido Obi made it 2-0 as he latched onto a ball over the top and calmly slotted home.",
      "Tyrone Samba produced a moment of magic shortly after as he gave City hope heading into the final few minutes of the contest, but United had the last laugh as Jim Thwaites curled a superb free-kick home to complete the scoring.",
      "Check out the highlights from the game in our blog below:",
      "That's the final whistle here.",
      "Gabriel, Obi and Thwaites win the derby for United.",
      "Thwaites with an incredible free-kick to restore the two-goal advantage.",
      "This has been a thoroughly entertaining game. Obi extended the advantage after gambling on a ball over the top, but City responded almost immediately to set up an interesting last few minutes.",
      "Samba gets his side back into the game with a wonderful strike.",
      "Obi extends the advantage after gambling on a through ball over the top.",
      "City midfielder Gorman just hit the crossbar from the edge of the box.",
      "United have 15 minutes to see out this victory in the U18 Manchester derby.",
      "Fletcher has been vocal throughout the game to encourage Obi to keep working hard for the team. The youngster’s out-of-possession work can be iffy, but he’s been excellent in that regard today. His pressing created the goal.",
      "Gabriel has fired United into the lead to break the deadlock. That was outstanding pressing from Obi to dispossess City, and Gabriel found the bottom left corner.",
      "The youngster celebrated with a knee slide in the corner before being mobbed by teammates.",
      "Thwaites has looked really sharp since coming on for the second half. He's only recently returned from injury, but you wouldn't know it. He adds class in the centre of the pitch when he plays, a real silky talent.",
      "Gabriel attempted to shoot while falling to the floor and his shot was wide of the post.",
      "The U16 Manchester derby is being played on the pitch behind us, and a melee broke out among players. After a pause, the referee awarded two red cards, one to each side. Carrick is watching the game from the sidelines because his son, Jayce, is playing in the game. Kai Rooney is also on the pitch.",
      "Thwaites has replaced McEvoy for United.",
      "Lamb has replaced Midwood for City.",
      "Back under way for the second half of the game.",
      "That's the whistle for the break at the Academy Stadium.",
      "Obi was an inch away from opening the scoring. His shot came back out from the inside of the post. Ajayi deserves all the credit for making an outstanding run with the ball to create the chance. The youngster picked it up in his own half and burst forward with impressive acceleration.",
      "Dunbar-McDonald with a chance from the edge of the box but it's straight at Bryne-Hughes.",
      "Stunning save from Bryne-Hughes to deny a header from Midwood.",
      "Midwood's shot from the right of the box flashed wide of the far post.",
      "Fletcher just shouted \"Chido, well played\" again. The 18-year-old danced around the blue shirts on the edge of the box and picked out the right pass, which earned him praise from Fletcher on the touchline.",
      "Samba just came close to scoring. Byrne-Hughes made a save, but he spilt the shot and United were able to clear the danger. The game is beginning to open up as both sides take more risks in search of the first goal.",
      "Obi had a very good chance just there but he sent the shot straight at the goalkeeper.",
      "That was a gorgeous pass from McCormack to send Brown down the right wing. Gabriel stepped up to take the subsequent free-kick and found Obi, but his header was sent over the bar.",
      "Samba just tried his luck from the edge of the box but his shot was fired well over the bar. There have been few chances created so far. City's goalkeeper Vickery almost gifted United a chance by playing out from the back, but Brown could not latch onto it to take advantage.",
      "Both sides are feeling each other out in the opening exchanges. It's been an even start. Gabriel is playing as a No.10, just behind Obi, which is interesting. Brown and Ajayi are on the right and left wings respectively.",
      "We're under way for the mini-Manchester derby.",
      "We're almost ready for kick-off here.",
      "XI | Vickery, Headley, Drake, Braithwaite, Barret, Miles, Dunbar-McDonald, Gorman, Midwood, Samba, Heskey.",
      "Subs | Hudson, Tevenan, Holt, Oliver, Lamb.",
      "XI | Byrne-Hughes, Helafu, Mills, Armer, Kukonki, McCormack, McEvoy, Brown, Gabriel, Obi, Ajayi.",
      "Subs | Heath, Watson, Thwaites, Mantato, Bradbury.",
      "City are at the top of the U18 North league table, four points clear with three games in hand to play over United. That makes City the overwhelming favourites to win the title, but United have an opportunity to make in rounds on their advantage with a win on their soil this afternoon."

      "Avram Glazer and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.(Image: 2024 Chris Brunskill/Fantasista)",
      "Just when the mood had lifted at Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave an interview that prompted the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to demand an apology from him.",
      "The communications team at United must have winced when they first read the quotes. Ratcliffe said the United Kingdom has been \"colonised by immigrants\" and his comments drew backlash.",
      "Ratcliffe issued a statement to say he was sorry his choice of language had offended some people, but added that it was \"important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration\".",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This is not an article to get into the politics, however, it is an examination of Ratcliffe's reputation in Manchester, and how he is viewed by the fans of the club he grew up supporting.",
      "Many have disagreed with Ratcliffe. Carly Lyes, chair of the MUFC Local Supporters' Club, an official branch for fans who live within a two-mile radius of Old Trafford, said his comments were a \"slap in the face.\"",
      "The co-founder of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club (MUMSC), Ghulam Haydar, said he was \"appalled\" by Ratcliffe's comments and questioned whether Muslims are welcome at the club.",
      "The 1958 protest group described Ratcliffe as a \"total embarrassment, whether in front of a camera or being interviewed.\" The Manchester United Supporters' Trust have reiterated the club belongs to everyone.",
      "United released an official statement, which did not directly refer to Ratcliffe, to distance themselves from the comments, saying the club \"prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming\" and that they will \"continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"",
      "Michael Carrick will be thankful for the 13-day gap between games for United, but he will inevitably face questions about Ratcliffe when he speaks at his press conference next week.",
      "A billboard outside Old Trafford.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Although the news cycle moves quickly in football, this feels like something that won't simply blow over. In the eyes of angry fans, Ratcliffe has caused further damage to an already poor reputation.",
      "The damage could be permanent. Some won't change their opinion about Ratcliffe, regardless of whether United are successful on the pitch in the coming years.",
      "The erosion of Ratcliffe's reputation has happened gradually since he acquired a minority stake in February 2024. There has been a catalogue of bad decisions committed by the 73-year-old.",
      "The Ineos regime's first big decision ahead of Ratcliffe's first full season as co-owner was to address Erik ten Hag's future. The Dutchman's contract was extended when overwhelming evidence indicated he should have been sacked.",
      "After the Dutchman departed, Ruud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis before Ruben Amorim was appointed. United paid around £11million to release him from his contract at Sporting, but Amorim lasted just 14 months in charge and received a £10m compensation package when he was axed.",
      "Dan Ashworth departed shortly after Amorim's appointment. It was said there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen (boardroom)\", and there was an internal clash over Ten Hag's successor. United paid a combined £14.5m to sack Ten Hag, his backroom staff and Ashworth.",
      "Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox.(Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)",
      "Off the pitch, Ratcliffe needed to lower the employee count, which was the highest in the Premier League, but the extent of the redundancies was brutal. That was the start of an assault on the club's identity: ticket prices have soared, and the penny pinching has known no bounds.",
      "Ratcliffe axed the annual £40,000 donation to the Association of Former Manchester United Players, which was set up in 1985 to support its 300-plus members, who represented the club in the years before huge wages. Gary Neville sat down with Ratcliffe last year and grilled him on the issue.",
      "He said: \"That’s not the players that played under Sir Alex, or even the last 10 years. They’re players from the 60s and 70s. Why not raise the money at a dinner? Give the ex-players their money. It’s a cruel decision.”",
      "Ratcliffe responded \"nobody has suggested that because I would have supported that\", in a comical scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in the political satire British television series 'The Thick of It'.",
      "United fans protested against the ownership of the club before the Fulham game at the start of the month. Ratcliffe was a target, just a few years after the same protestors had welcomed his investment.",
      "Last year, Ratcliffe said he would walk away from United if he got \"abused\" in the same way the Glazer family have. His reputation among fans has sunk as low as the Glazers'.",

      "Mason Mount pictured in the stands during a spell out injured with Manchester United(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are unrecognisable from the team which Ruben Amorim left following a 1-1 draw at Leeds last month. Since Michael Carrick's return, the formation has changed, the style of football has become more exciting and players are being used in positions which suit their strengths.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is an example of that. United's captain and talisman was less effective playing in the deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro but now has more freedom to impact matches further up the pitch as a No.10. Patrick Dorgu, prior to his injury, became a revelation on the left wing having struggled at wing-back under Amorim.",
      "United are a different beast these days and while on the surface it seems like everyone is a winner, there is one man who will be wondering what comes next. Under Amorim, Mason Mount was a firm favourite and his performances were impressive.",

      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "He scored two of his three goals this season in a three-match spell which cemented him in the former head coach's plans. After the second of these strikes in the 4-1 win at Wolves, Amorim went out of his way to hail the performance of Mount.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me [to see Mount doing well],\" Amorim said. \"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martinez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "\"It doesn't matter the situation, Mason Mount is always the same thing - training, talking, dealing with people around Carrington. That is not easy, so he's a very, very good player.\"",
      "Fastforward two months and suddenly Mount's time at United is in serious jeopardy again. The change to the 4-2-3-1 formation has seen Mount suffer a similar fate to Kobbie Mainoo earlier in the campaign.",
      "Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes celebrate as Manchester United beat Crystal Palace(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The former Chelsea man is now battling for just one spot in this side, rather than two, and that battle is against Fernandes. It does not matter who the head coach is, Fernandes will always be the first name on the teamsheet.",
      "So if Mount is not starting as the central attacking midfielder in this team, the question is where does he fit? He has previously played on the left and right but he is not threatening to start on either flank.",
      "On the left is Matheus Cunha and now Dorgu; while on the right Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are holding down the fort. This leaves Mount in the wilderness.",
      "At 27, he is in the prime of his career, but even when fit he does not have a regular place in this side. A lack of United fixtures this campaign has not helped but it poses the question as to what United should do with Mount? He has two years remaining on his contract so a fee in the region of £20m would be enough to avoid United making a loss under PSR.",

      "That price could tempt a potential buyer but his recent injury record, coupled with his United wage, could put potential suitors off. But it is starting to become impossible to see a scenario where he can stay at United especially when he risks losing the best years of his career as a back-up option.",
      "Back in December, you would not have thought Mount would be faced with the prospect of considering his options elsewhere. That now feels like the only way forward.",

      "According to The Sun, the partnership, which operates Inverse by Pestana CR7 venues throughout Portugal, has applied to register the trademark in the UK.

      "WARNING YOUTUBE Screengrab\n\nCAPTION: Sir Alex Ferguson after his final game at Old Trafford\n\nYOUTUBE LINK:  https://www.youtube.com/@SkySportsRetro\n\n\n\n(Image: youtube/@SkySportsRetro)",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson cemented his legacy as Manchester United boss with one final Premier League triumph in the 2012/13 season. Over almost three decades at Old Trafford, the Scottish manager won an incredible amount of trophies.",
      "These included a record 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, five FA Cups, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. He is regarded as the greatest coach the English top-flight has ever seen and became the man many clubs loved to hate.",
      "After announcing his departure from the club in May 2013, Fergie helped the club to another Premier League title and qualification for the UEFA Champions League. United beat their closest opponents, Manchester City, by 11 points and lost just five games throughout the season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The reporter questioned the absence of Wayne Rooney in the starting line-up and the bench. Ferguson was extremely honest and revealed that the United icon had requested a move - and he even gave a reason for Rooney's decision.",
      "At the time, Fergie said: \"I don't think Wayne was keen to play simply because he's asked for the transfer.",
      "\"I think he wants to think it through in his mind, I think that's a good idea. We're not going to let him go and I think he's maybe just a little bit frustrated [after] being taken off once or twice in the last few weeks.\"",
      "Ferguson called out Wayne Rooney(Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)",
      "This revelation would never happen in the Premier League today with many managers opting to protect their players by keeping transfers as under wraps as possible. And it seems like even though Ferguson left in 2013, he still held stature at the club afterwards, as Rooney didn't end up leaving Manchester until 2017 - four years after Ferguson's departure.",
      "Another shocking claim made by Sir Alex was the fact that the club was \"leaking\" information. This was in relation to his planned exit from United being shared around in the public before his official announcement.",
      "When asked why he waited for months to reveal the departure - after making his decision during the festive season - Ferguson stated that he wanted to keep it secret as long as he could. After telling family members and his squad of players on the Tuesday, rumours began to circulate.",
      "The United boss criticised the club in his last interview(Image: ANDREW YATES/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The United icon said: \"Unfortunately there were rumours going around on Tuesday [but] wherever it comes from, you never know. Our club's a sieve, stuff leaks out and it shouldn't leak out but we then started to speed it up a bit.\"",
      "This is a pattern that continued over the years at United, with an internal investigation being launched just weeks ago in January 2026 to find the source of current leaks. This decision came after the starting XI was 'leaked' to press hours before the club's 2-0 derby win over City.",
      "Ferguson's legacy at United is one that is unlikely to be tainted given just how successful he was at the helm. But he laid down a few home truths in his final words as the manager of one of the most successful teams in England.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has indicated it will be tricky to see Marcus Rashford make his way back to Old Trafford, with the club also needing to maintain harmony among other squad members. The 28-year-old has flourished during his loan spell at Barcelona, which is set to conclude this summer.",
      "Barcelona hold an option to make the move permanent for £26million, and Rashford has repeatedly expressed his desire for the transfer to happen. Yet, if Barca opt against triggering the clause and he heads back to United, Brown reckons it could prove challenging for the manager, be that Michael Carrick or another appointment, to maintain positive working relationships.",
      "Speaking to Betting Lounge, Brown said: \"It's a tough one. For me, it's all about relationships. There's a lot of players to keep happy. That's another matter the club will have to deal with.",
      "\"If Marcus Rashford did come back, I don't think he would have a problem with anyone, and there wouldn't be a problem on the pitch given the quality he has.\"",
      "Former Reds manager Ruben Amorim excluded Rashford from his squad due to worries about his training standards and failure to fulfil expected professional benchmarks. That call eventually resulted in the forward's loan moves to Aston Villa and subsequently Barcelona.",
      "Brown continued by suggesting that lifting silverware with the Spanish champions before the season's conclusion would prove hugely significant for him, particularly after everything that transpired in Manchester.",

      "An apology if anyone was offended by his choice was language was issued the following day but has seemingly done little to change the reaction of what the billionaire said or meant.

      "While his former United teammate Michael Carrick has impressed in his spell as caretaker boss, Ferdinand has long championed former Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi, who reportedly held confidential discussions with the club in 2024 before joining Marseille.",
      "Ferdinand expressed his admiration for the Italian back in January during a debate over potential successors to the dismissed Ruben Amorim. On his Rio Presents podcast, he said \"Someone who's free right now; not free [but] someone who's gettable.",

      "Marseille, currently sitting fourth in Ligue 1 and trailing PSG by 12 points, released a statement saying: \"Following discussions between all stakeholders in the club's management - the owner, president, director of football, and coach - it was decided to make a change at the helm of the first team.",

      "\"This was a difficult collective decision, taken after careful consideration in the best interests of the club, in order to respond to the sporting challenges of the end of the season.\"",
      "De Zerbi has reportedly had confrontations with senior management at former clubs. When questioned about whether United require a combative manager, Ferdinand remained steadfast, declaring: \"I'd bring fire to the party, I'm telling you.",
      "\"I'd bring fire... I wouldn't bring craziness, but I'd bring [in] someone who's bringing that fire, that passion. But really, really backed up by someone who's shown that they can coach the life out of a team. They can coach the hell out of a team.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick shares a word with Benjamin Sesko(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick's return to Manchester United has been an overwhelming success so far. Even taking into account the draw against West Ham on Tuesday night, the Reds remain in a much better place than they were under Ruben Amorim's leadership.",
      "It is hard to know how United would have performed if Amorim had been in charge, maybe they would have nicked a point at the London Stadium. But the general consensus has been that United would not have beaten all of Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham or Tottenham Hotspur beforehand so Carrick's impressive impact on this squad is rightfully being recognised.",
      "Thanks to this, it has been difficult for anyone, either inside or outside the squad, to question Carrick's approach to the job or the team selections he has made. He has subscribed to the mantra of 'if it's not broke, don't fix it.'",

      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The trip to West Ham saw the Reds pick the same team for the third successive fixture and the only time Carrick has altered the starting line-up has been due to injury. But on Tuesday night, it was a substitute who ensured the unbeaten run remained intact.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored arguably one of United's goals of the season with his intuitive flick at the near post rescuing a point for the Reds. This is not the first time that Sesko has managed to score important goals for the club since Amorim was replaced.",
      "He now has four goals in his last five Premier League matches and has a respectable seven goals in 23 United appearances, with only Bryan Mbeumo having scored more than him this season.",
      "Due to United's early exits in the Carabao and FA Cups, coupled with no European football this season, opportunities for Carrick to rotate the squad are limited. The absence of football outside the Premier League also means the Reds have an empty weekend this week.",
      "But once United return to action a week on Monday, Carrick could have an awkward conversation to come with Sesko if he does not start for the trip to Everton. Currently, the Slovenian is earning himself the tag of 'super sub' but ask any player and they will tell you they do not want to earn a reputation for being good enough solely off the bench.",

      "Sesko even made his pitch to start more often in his post-match interview with MUTV. \"I think everyone wanted it, everyone was trying to win the game, to score, to fight for each other,\" he explained.",
      "\"Unfortunately that didn't happen, but at least we got a draw, which is important in the end. I felt amazing because at least I know that, once again, I could help the team by trying to secure at least one point.\"",
      "At some stage, Carrick will be unable to ignore the impact Sesko is making off the bench and will need to look at starting the forward. The only question then would be who drops out.",
      "The obvious answer would be to move Mbeumo out to the right and put Amad onto the bench. While the Ivorian is a good threat for United, it would not harm him to have a spell out of the team to give Sesko a chance. Whatever Carrick decides to do, it is at least progress to see United giving their head coach positive selection dilemmas.",

      "The move will see him team up with former Manchester United striker Robin van Persie, who is now head coach at his childhood club.",

The 31-year-old was reportedly keen to remain in London after returning to his home city to sign for Chelsea, but the mutual termination of his contract at the club has paved the way for him to play and relocate elsewhere.",

      "But things didn't work out as planned for Sterling, though, with Enzo Maresca sidelining the player from the squad early in his tenure at the club and determining he had no future role in his plans. A loan switch to Arsenal on transfer deadline day in August 2024 enabled him to remain in the capital, whilst linking up with Mikel Arteta once more - the pair having previously worked together at City",

The British Manchester United co-owner - who resides in Monaco - caused widespread uproar over his comments with Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, even calling for an apology.",
      "Now, the FA have stepped in to identify whether Ratcliffe has breached any guidelines. Ratcliffe told Sky News on Wednesday: \"You can't afford... you can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn't it?\"",
      "As per Football Associations rules, 'there are no set sanctions for media comments or social networking comments cases'. However, the guidelines do state that financial penalties are the 'most usual' form of sanction for such cases.",

      "As a result, Ratcliffe could be charged by the FA by Monday at the very latest - given the interview took place on Wednesday.

      "Lammens spoke to a handful of Manchester-based correspondents as he left the London Stadium. He was asked about how Sesko has responded to being named on the bench and said: \"Honestly, he's been like he's always been the whole season, even if he's starting or not starting.",
      "\"I think he knows how important he is for us, even when he's not starting. Like today and against Fulham, because in the end, when we need a goal, we can always count on him.",
      "\"So that's why he was important today. I think he did his job well, but I'm sure if he starts, he'll also do his job. It's nice to be able to count on him in both occasions.\"",
      "Sesko demonstrated impressive technique with his goal(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Speaking after the draw, Sesko said he was \"happy\" to secure a point but disappointed not to have won the game. Lammens admitted he had \"mixed feelings\" about the result as well.",
      "\"Still a bit disappointed and felt like we didn't really play the way we should have, especially in the first half, we didn't create as much. I think we needed to be more sharp with the ball,\" he said.",
      "\"We needed to create more. Of course, when you score in the end and still get a point, it's always a bit better, but still, the overall feeling is a bit disappointing for us.\"",
      "When asked whether playing two games in four days was a reason for the flatter performance, Lammens said: \"It could be a bit of both. I think they're always a hard side to play against, especially in here. We have difficulties at home as well against them, so it's always difficult coming here.\"",
      "He added: \"They know what they have to do, how they defend us. A low block is always difficult to play against. And then, like I said, we have to be at our best and sharp to be able to create chances against them. We weren't that sharp today, like we've been the last couple of weeks.",
      "\"So I think it's a bit of everything. Also, not being able to or... Because the last game was three days ago, you can't put excuses on it. Because they also had a game two or three days ago.",
      "\"But still, like you said, we've been used to playing one game a week. It's a little bit in the legs, I think. But if we want to be a team playing for the top, then we can't use that as an excuse.",
      "\"So we need to learn from this, because we'll play against a team like West Ham did today. For more games in the future, so we need to be able to play against them and create chances.\"",
      "Senne Lammens made a save to deny Callum Wilson.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Lammens made a strong save to deny Crysencio Summerville in the first half, and produced an excellent stop to prevent Callum Wilson from scoring when he was one-on-one in the final minutes.",
      "The 23-year-old has not made headlines during Carrick's unbeaten run as interim, but he's been quietly one of the most important players in the dressing room, just as he has since making his debut in October.",
      "\"I think the way Michael took over against City, especially when he only had two or three days to prepare us [was impressive],\" he reflected. \"Just one of his strong suits as well, being clear about what he wants, communication. So we knew what we had to do. The plan was clear.",
      "\"So we executed them against the first two games against City and Arsenal... It's a bit different because it's a different kind of game today, for example. We don't really have to make the game ourselves.",
      "\"It's more of being able to be compact and play from the counter and creating chances. That's one of our strong suits. So we know against those teams we can do good. But then against Fulham and against Tottenham at home, we had to play more of our game. I think we did that.",
      "\"Not always the prettiest, but the result was always there, which is the most important thing, which we haven't really done all season. Get those results or get those streaks going, like four wins in a row.",
      "\"So, yeah, we felt really good getting those wins in. Today was a little bit disappointing because we wanted to continue that. Now as well, being two weeks without a game, you want to go in that period with a good feeling.",
      "\"It's a little bit less bad because we scored at the end, but still not the best feeling. But I think the first five games with him as a coach, we can be happy with and looking forward to the rest.\"",
      "With eight minutes remaining, Carrick replaced Diogo Dalot with Joshua Zirkzee. Lammens spoke about the importance of gambling when trailing in a match, saying: \"Yeah, I think you always have to be, if you're down in the end, you always have to be a little bit of a gambling team.",
      "\"That's why we also made those substitutions. And that's my job as well, like you said, to help the team out a little bit at the end, to make that save so we can be able to still score a goal and get that point. So I'm happy I could help my team as well today.\"",
      "Lammens will continue to help United for the remainder of the season. He is having an excellent debut campaign.",

      "Thomas Tuchel was previously linked with a move to Manchester United as head coach(Image: (Photo by Hector Vivas - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images))",
      "Thomas Tuchel has signed a new two-year contract with the England national team and will remain in post until after Euro 2028 - having \"loved every minute\" of being the Three Lions boss. It comes as a potential blow to Manchester United, as an option for the permanent head coach role at Old Trafford in the summer is now seemingly off the market.",
      "The Football Association confirmed the plans before England's Nations League draw in Brussels, with Tuchel attending in Belgium. This represents a significant achievement for the FA, as there has been considerable interest in Tuchel - including from Manchester United - but the German has even surprised himself with how much he is relishing the position, according to The Mirror.",
      "Tuchel's decision to stay on is effectively a snub to United. The Reds approached Tuchel two years ago under the new ownership structure with Ineos, but opted to retain Erik ten Hag in what proved a shambolic managerial recruitment process.",
      "Tuchel was attracted to the prospect of Old Trafford - though he was unimpressed by how the situation was conducted.",
      "Following United's subsequent dismissal of ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, they now have Michael Carrick as caretaker, but should they pursue a high-profile appointment, no superior option exists than Tuchel - and he was understood to have been a primary target to take over.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That possibility has, however, now been shut down; his future is confirmed, and that provides reassurance for the FA whilst also simplifying matters when he addresses the media in Brussels at the draw.",
      "Speaking to the official England media team, Tuchel said on the new deal: \"I am very happy and proud to extend my time with England. It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup. It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud.",
      "“I have had so much support from Mark [Bullingham], all my colleagues at the FA and from fans wherever I go that I did not hesitate when asked to continue in this dream job.",
      "\"EURO 2028 will be a very special tournament and as a coach there is nothing more you want than to compete with the very best on the biggest possible stage.”",
      "Tuchel was previously attracted by joining United but has opted to remain as England boss(Image: Getty)",
      "Tuchel presided over a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign, has been entirely dedicated to planning for the summer regarding the base camp, and has thrown himself into his new role.",
      "The 52-year-old will continue his role with England for over the next two years, meaning the United board will have to look elsewhere in their hopes of finding another head coach to take them forward.",
      "Carrick's impressive spell early on in the dugout at Old Trafford has garnered some support from a section of fans to make him the permanent hire, though others will need convincing by the end of the season, with Champions League qualification the ultimate goal over the next few months.",
      "External options in the market will depend on the route that the club wishes to go down, as they mull over experience against a fresh face, playing style against trophy success.",
      "The World Cup fallout will have an impact, with high-profile options like Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann, Carlo Ancelotti, and Didier Deschamps all potentially available - but Tuchel will no longer be part of the potential manager shuffle that is waiting in the summer.",

      "Andy Burnham has criticised comments on 'immigrants' by Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The mayor of Greater Manchester, in a stinging rebuke, said the comments 'go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood'.",
      "And in what appears to be a reference to the Glazer ownership of United, Mr Burnham spoke of 'those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions'.",
      "Sir Jim, the founder and chairman of one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos, said in an interview that 'the UK has been colonised by immigrants'.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday night described the comments as 'offensive and wrong' - and called on him to apologise.",
      "In an interview with Sky News, the Ineos owner said: \"You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.",
      "Andy Burnham(Image: PA)",
      "\"I mean, the UK is being colonised. It’s costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants.\"",
      "\"If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you are going to have to do some things which are unpopular and show some courage.\"",
      "He went on to describe Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as 'an intelligent man' with 'good intentions'.",
      "Andy Burnham, middle, and Jim Ratcliffe, right",
      "But in a statement issued on Thursday morning, Mr Burnham criticised the comments - and said footballers who have arrived in Greater Manchester over the years 'have enhanced the life of our city-region'. He also praised the contribution of NHS workers and those in other industries.",
      "The mayor said: \"These comments go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood: a place where people of all races, faiths and none have pulled together over centuries to build our city and our institutions, including Manchester United FC. Calling for curbs on levels of immigration is one thing; portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force is quite another. It is inaccurate, insulting, inflammatory and should be withdrawn.",
      "Protests at United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city-region, as have the many people working in Greater Manchester's NHS and other essential services and industries.",
      "\"We appreciate their contribution as a city-region famous for the warmth of our welcome. If any criticism is needed, it should be directed towards those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions.\"",
      "Sir Jim bought a minority share in Manchester United in late 2023 and his Ineos group has since taken control of football operations.",
      "The billionaire has presided over a variety of contentious changes since becoming part of the ownership, with ticket pricing and availability causing particular anger among United fans.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd are ‘accelerating’ talks to re-sign Scott McTominay in the summer transfer window from Italian giants Napoli, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed the Scotland international to leave Old Trafford for Napoli in a transfer worth £52m in the summer of 2024.",
      "McTominay won the Scudetto in his first season at Napoli, who have won Serie A just four times, with the 29-year-old joining a short list of champions at the club, including Diego Maradona.",
      "The midfielder contributed 12 goals and four assists in his first campaign in Serie A and he is currently on nine goals and three assists in all competitions this term.",
      "There have been rumours that Man Utd are interested in bringing him back to Old Trafford with discussions ‘reignited’ in December about a potential return.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes claims that Man Utd are ‘accelerating to finalise the return’ of McTominay and have ‘reopened a seemingly deadlocked interest’ in the Scotland international.",
      "READ: England ‘sh*tshow’ removes Manchester United question after Tuchel ‘cop-out’",
      "McTominay ‘fits the profile they’re looking for to strengthen their midfield: physicality, attacking prowess, and experience in high-pressure situations.’",
      "The report adds: ‘The player’s entourage admits that the possibility of returning to the Premier League motivates him. After his previous spell at Old Trafford, the Scot feels he has unfinished business in England and that his current footballing maturity would allow him to take on a more decisive role.’",
      "Fichajes continues: ‘Sources close to the deal indicate that the coming weeks will be decisive. If SSC Napoli manages to convince Scott McTominay with a solid project and improved terms, the Italian club will secure continuity in its midfield. Otherwise, the stage will be set for Manchester United to make a move.’",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville was accused by Jamie Carragher of “killing” McTominay while the Old Trafford academy graduate was still in Manchester.",

      "But Neville insisted: “I didn’t say he wasn’t good enough… Not me. I never thought they should have got rid of him.”",
      "Speaking late last year, McTominay described his love for Naples: “The people of Naples are incredible, they’re so passionate, and everywhere you go, there are people who say ‘Forza Napoli’ and want to talk to you and have a conversation, and that inspires you every time you step onto the pitch because it’s important to them too.",
      "“It’s different, it’s a totally different way of life—the way you eat, the way you live, and everything else. It gives you more mental strength. I’ve always lived very close to my mum, so I could go to her whenever I wanted.",
      "“Now I live 1,500 miles away, so I can’t just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister, and my kids, so it’s different. In life, sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone, and I’ve always prided myself on that. I never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go anywhere and succeed and do well, why not? Who’s to stop me from doing that?”",

      "“My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.”",
      "And that has not stopped former Match of the Day presenter Lineker hitting out at Ratcliffe, he said on The Rest is Football: “The hypocrisy really – the guy’s a migrant himself, an economic migrant [because] he lives in Monaco. You can have a gripe all you like, but at least be here, pay tax and contribute to our society.",
      "“I would say a lot of these migrants who come in contribute enormously and facts show you that in terms of revenue and paid tax. Whereas, Jim out there, in Monaco, is doing everything he can to avoid paying tax.”",

      "Lineker continued: “Also, you’re one of the owners of Manchester United, a club that has a lot of players from overseas. When he’s talking about colonised with immigrants, is it OK that you’re a white person living abroad, not a brown or black person? I don’t know, only he can answer that question.",
      "“Lots and lots of my friends who support United have come on and said similar things to what I’m saying now, they’re very disappointed. Look at the story of [how] Amad has ended up here. So I find it deeply concerning that an owner of a football club can say that sort of thing. Anyway, we’ll move on.”",

      "But to the ‘unimpressed fans’ who reckon Arsenal ”should be docked 12 points” we really must go. And that takes us to the offending/offended tweeter in question, @Cormsbadger, whose post with zero interactions to 990 followers is deemed headline-worthy by a presumably reputable outlet.",
      "Does it matter that @Cormsbadger is actually an ‘unimpressed fan’ of Aston Villa? Or that Arsenal wore the same colour shorts earlier this season against Athletic Club? Well no. None of this sh*t matters. But still.",
      "",
      "The news of England extending the contract of Thomas Tuchel through to Euro 2028 has caused some predictable head-loss in a media more than happy to write about past Three Lions failures.",
      "Fabio Capello had the break clause in his deal removed before the disastrous 2010 World Cup, so a different FA signing a different manager of different players to a longer deal than he joined on 16 years later is obviously An Error.",
      "The entirely risk-averse Phil McNulty of BBC Sport refers to the Capello situation as ‘a cautionary tale’ here, while Jason Burt of the Daily Telegraph calls it a ‘cop-out’ from the FA.",
      "A reminder that the dictionary definition of ‘cop-out’ is ‘an instance of avoiding a commitment or responsibility’. Which sounds like the perfect description of a two-year contract extension.",
      "The Capello thing is not completely irrelevant but it is also one specific example of a slightly different thing backfiring massively, one time, more than a decade and a half ago.",
      "Charlie Wyett of The Sun is especially critical, asking ‘what was the hurry?’ and warning that ‘the World Cup could turn into a s***show’ for Tuchel and England, before dredging up the Jude Bellingham “repulsive” angle – which Tuchel has long since apologised for and clarified – and ‘some would prefer an Englishman as boss’ narratives.",
      "To his credit/detriment, he does entirely undermine his own arguments about the need for the deal and how it potentially exposes England by pointing out that a) ‘there will surely be some sort of clause after the World Cup if they want to get rid of Tuchel’, and b) ‘by sorting the contract now, it ends any uncertainty over his future and cuts out endless questions during the World Cup’.",
      "Mediawatch is far easier when the subjects do the work for us.",
      "",
      "Andy Dunn then goes off on one in the Daily Mirror, slamming the FA for setting too low a bar in terms of objectives (‘reaching the last eight is sufficient’, apparently), bringing up the false Capello equivalence and just generally wondering why England and Tuchel have extended their arrangement now.",
      "‘What has changed since his short-term appointment?’ Dunn asks.",
      "The long-term managerial situations at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Spurs. And very possibly Manchester City past this summer. That all feels quite important when discussing a world-class manager who has been mentioned in regards to those roles, and whose current employers might wish for him not to join the pool of best available coaches.",
      "He also might have really enjoyed his time in charge thus far, with England sensing he is the best current candidate for the job and it is worth cutting predictable speculation off at the source before it becomes distracting? Dunno, just spitballing.",
      "Dunn then indulges in the same ‘What if England are sh*t at the World Cup?’ alternative timeline doom-mongering.",
      "As the Daily Mail‘s Jack Gaughan and most other sensible journalists have pointed out, ‘these contracts almost always come with break clauses now’. So there’s that sorted.",
      "Not one month ago, Dunn wrote that Manchester United ‘should act now’ if they wanted Tuchel, to sign him up to start immediately after the World Cup.",
      "‘You can rest assured the FA would not be happy if United approached Tuchel in the build-up to the finals. That, though, should not be United’s concern,’ he said.",
      "Yet it might well have been the FA’s, hence the new contract.",
      "‘As it stands right now,’ Dunn wrote in January, ‘Tuchel is available towards the end of July – no compensation payment required. But Ruben Amorim’s departure and United’s current situation will be the subject of a lot of discussion in the corridors of Football Association power.’",
      "Yet now they’re being criticised by the same writer in February for ensuring that isn’t a factor worth considering ahead of a major international tournament.",
      "The literal opening paragraph to that piece from Dunn last month was: ‘Without giving away trade secrets, there is a strong possibility the next question a member of the media puts to Thomas Tuchel will not be exclusively about England. It will also be about Manchester United.’",
      "Is he just annoyed at having to think of something different and less predictable to ask?",
      "",
      "England were drawn against Spain, Croatia and Czechia in the upcoming Nations League, a group described by The Sun website as both ‘brutal’ and a ‘nightmare’.",
      "It’s League A. All the potential opponents are quite good there. That’s literally the entire point.",
      "But not for one second are we having the description of Croatia as England’s ‘bogey team’. It’s not 2007, although it isn’t surprising that The Sun might wish to go back to a time when they were far more relevant.",
      "‘England will also face the runners up from 2023 in bogey team Croatia, who famously dumped them out of the 2018 World Cup semi-finals in extra time.’",
      "England also relatively famously beat them in the opener of Euro 2021, and admittedly less famously but still completely pertinently beat them – in the Nations League – after that World Cup semi-final defeat.",

      "What a shame for the Daily Mirror website that their headline frames Virgil van Dijk as the Liverpool star who ‘may never play for club again’.",
      "How frustrated they must have been when they realised their mistake, with that pesky ‘as’ linking the otherwise entirely unrelated stories of 1) Van Dijk wanting Liverpool to keep Ibrahima Konate, and 2) Wataru Endo picking up an injury which might end his season, and the Japan international potentially being sold this summer.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “colonised by immigrants” have caused ‘alarm’ among the Manchester United players, who believe the Red Devils co-owner is ‘out of touch’ and have ‘noted’ the double standards at play.",
      "United co-owner Ratcliffe made the misguided statement in a scathing interview about the immigration system and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in which he claimed the UK will face huge economic problems as pressure increases on the welfare state to aid incoming foreigners.",
      "The 73-year-old was given the full c-word treatment in the Mailbox after he also made clear his respect for Reform party leader Nigel Farage in his interview with Sky News.",
      "After coming under severe scrutiny and with Starmer himself insisting the comments were “offensive and wrong”, Ratcliffe offered a half-baked apology before Manchester United released their own statement, which the Daily Mail claim ‘was worked upon for hours and involved a delicate balancing act between all parties’.",
      "The statement read: ‘Manchester United prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club.",
      "‘Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.",
      "‘Since launching All Red All Equal in 2016, we have embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do.",
      "‘We remain deeply committed to the principles and spirit of that campaign. They are reflected in our policies but also in our culture and are reinforced by our holding of the Premier League’s Advanced Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Standard.",
      "‘Over the course of this season, we have participated in events and initiatives at our men’s and women’s games marking mental health, LGBTQ+ inclusion, No Room for Racism, violence against women and girls and homophobic chanting.",
      "‘We have also celebrated our supporters’ clubs’ events, including our Disabled Supporters’ Association’s Christmas Party and our Jewish Supporters’ Club’s Chanukah event. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be supporting further initiatives in these areas.",
      "‘This all sits alongside the incredible work which the Manchester United Foundation undertakes in and around Manchester on a daily basis.",
      "‘Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent. We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.’",
      "But the Daily Mail add that ‘some of the players were alarmed’ by Ratcliffe’s comments and ‘one insider warned it wouldn’t sit well within the dressing room’, which features 17 overseas players.",
      "It’s claimed those players ‘put the controversy down to a 73-year-old who is out of touch’ and they’ve ‘noted that Ratcliffe is unlikely to face the same action from the FA or the club as one of them if they made similar comments in public’.",
      "Former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker has hit out at Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his comments about immigrants.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘no words’ for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has ‘a lot to answer for’ after his ‘colonised by immigrants’ comments.",
      "Man Utd have made their stance on inclusivity perfectly clear after Sir Jim Ratcliffe issued a non-apology for his “colonised by immigrants” comments.",
      "The Ruben Amorim era was bad enough but going for immigrants and those on benefits – the daft, old hypocrite – is top of Sir Jim Ratcliffe 20 mistakes at ...",
      "Jim Ratcliffe suggested this week that the UK had been “colonised” by immigrants and made an incorrect claim about the population.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a ‘colossal t*t’ who deserves a colossal kicking for his views on immigration."

      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new players in the summer transfer window with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Senne Lammens all joining the Premier League club.",
      "However, the early parts of the season didn’t go to plan with Man Utd continuing their inconsistent form from the previous season under Ruben Amorim.",

      "“Most clubs feel if you go for a big name in January (unless they are due to be out of contract), you pay a premium.",
      "“Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there’s a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "“Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It’s a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that’s why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "“Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we’re talking over £100m.”",
      "Real Madrid midfielder Valverde has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for years and there are rumours he could become available in the summer.",

      "The Uruguay international is ‘fed up’ with Arbeloa and is unhappy at the possibility of the Spaniard ‘continuing as manager and has already expressed his concerns to the Real Madrid hierarchy’.",
      "Sources close to the Real Madrid midfielder have said that ‘his message is that if the coach stays for another season, he will request a transfer in the summer to avoid having to work under him any longer’.",
      "Valverde ‘believes that the manager’s methods and internal management are not aligned with what the team needs at this time’ and it’s understood that this ‘discontent has been building and has led the Uruguayan to be very clear about the manager’s future’.",
      "The report adds: ‘In this scenario, Manchester United ‘s interest has emerged strongly. The English club has already made preliminary contact with the player’s representatives to explore a possible move in the upcoming transfer window. At Old Trafford, they highly value his profile for the Premier League, where he would be well-suited to take on responsibility in big matches.’",
      "The report continues: ‘If the manager ultimately stays and the Uruguayan follows through on his threat, the summer will heat up with high-stakes negotiations. Manchester United are reportedly prepared to make a substantial offer to convince the club, while  Valverde prioritizes an ambitious project where he feels valued and respected in his position on the pitch.’",

      "“It could be a route back for Marcus Rashford at Man Utd, definitely,” Meulensteen told BetGoat. “I think Marcus is still as ‘red’ as anyone because he came through the ranks as a young kid, and that will never go away, that will never leave him.",
      "“It’s the same with Scott McTominay. Both players have done extremely well wherever they’ve gone. But I think it was good for Marcus to have that spell away, first of all at Aston Villa, but now at Barcelona. It’s a different culture, a different language, and a different style. Every week is different.",

      "Man Utd ‘will not budge’ but Barcelona are looking to tempt them into possible swap deals for the 28-year-old.",
      "“Yes, definitely,” Deco told Sport when asked if he and the rest of the board are pleased with Rashford’s progress. “I think it wasn’t easy to come here. He has played at a very high level, with enormous demands at a club like Manchester United.",
      "“Then he spent six months at Aston Villa, where he did a very good job. In fact, Aston Villa, they would have kept him if it had been possible. I know this because I’ve spoken to people there.",
      "“But he only wanted to come to Barca, and that’s a very positive thing. We were able to secure a loan. The fact that he took a pay cut to make it happen is a clear demonstration that he really wanted to come, and we’re very happy about that. He’s a player who contributes a lot to the team.”",
      "Deco, 48, is right in that the salary sacrifice was a vital contribution to get Rashford’s Barcelona loan over the line. The Spanish powerhouse’s finances wouldn’t allow them to sign him on his previous £300,000 a week terms at United, and he agreed to reduce his fee to £225,000 a week to make the move happen.",

      "A report has claimed Barcelona ‘would include’ Casado – who’s valued at £22m and has started 12 games this season – in a deal for Rashford as they’re ‘willing to do without’ him.",
      "Assuming United end up spending big on one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba as has been reported, they could do with their second central midfield signing – and they will need another – to cost very little, or indeed feel like not outlay whatsoever, as would be the case in a swap with Rashford.",
      "",
      "427th time’s a charm. A transfer saga which peaked in the summer of 2022 when United had a bid accepted by Barcelona before De Jong dug his heels in has bubbled to the surface in nigh-on every transfer window since. The Netherlands international has never given any indication of interest in a move to Old Trafford because he, well, plays for Barcelona.",
      "He’s got a lot of contract too, having signed an extension until 2029 in October, making this the most pie in the sky option of all on this list. You never know though; he’s valued by Transfermarkt at just £40m and cynics will suggest that Barcelona extending his deal was more a means to ensure a decent transfer fee should United or other suitors come knocking.",
      "Despite being a very talented footballer and a key leader for the La Liga side, it’s never felt as though his position or role in the club – even often as captain – is particularly secure. Might the chance to prove himself in the Premier League intrigue De Jong?",
      "We suspect Barcelona would open the doors should United offer cash plus Rashford for the midfielder to be a key part of the Michael Carrick project. A De Jong/Kobbie Mainoo midfield could be quite something.",
      "",
      "Ten guesses to the unenlightened and we doubt they would name Araujo as club captain of Barcelona. The centre-back has started just seven La Liga games this season, admittedly thanks in part to injury and a mental health break, and has forever been one of the candidates put forward by Barcelona in swap moves or in a bid to raise a bit of cash.",
      "A report claims the Catalans ‘would be content with a simple player swap’ for Rashford. Yeah, we bet you would, chaps. United have plenty of superior centre-backs.",
      "",
      "His 87th-minute strike in the 4-3 win over Manchester United in November 2023 led to predictable links with Old Trafford, made more predictable because of the namesake fun he would offer, mainly to Peter Drury.",
      "Barcelona swept Bardghji up from Copenhagen for a £2m pittance and he’s barely played despite showing a fair whack of his enviable talent when he has featured, because that enviable talent pales in comparison to his competition on the right wing at Barcelona.",
      "For Manchester United, or almost any club for that matter, someone with even half the quality of Lamine Yamal sounds pretty sweet, and at 20, there’s huge resale value in Bardghji assuming they manage to snap him up for half a Rashford or so.",
      "",
      "There will be a fair bit of indifference and perhaps even some discontent among United fans should they opt to swap arguably their great academy graduate of this century for someone who didn’t make the grade at Manchester City, but Garcia has proven himself to be a very useful player in Barcelona, at centre-back, right-back and at the base of midfield.",
      "His Transfermarkt value suggests he would be a straight swap for Rashford and the INEOS bosses might just consider a versatile 25-year-old with his volume of experience at the highest level a decent exchange option.",
      "Real Madrid are more than a trophy-hoarding team of superstars; they have embraced their opportunity to become sustainability trend-setters too.",
      "The ‘entitlement’ argument has reared its ugly head as Arsenal yet again, with Mikel Arteta told to ‘take a leaf out of’ one surprise title winner’s book.",
      "Spurs have taken a remarkable risk in appointing Igor Tudor, but his sustained record of rescuing clubs mid-season does show method in the apparent madness.",
      "Someone wants to know ‘what has changed since his short-term appointment?’ after Thomas Tuchel extended his England contract. The managerial situations at Manchester United and elsewhere…",
      "While you wait for the next manager to be fired, test your knowledge on the big sackings that shocked the game. And some that really did not…",
      "Brighton have been displaced as ‘the best run club in the country’ by Brentford, whose ‘Liverpool rejects’ completely ‘suffocated’ Arsenal in their 1-1 draw."

      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest – and worst – post-Ferguson Manchester United manager to be sacked, seemingly more for challenging Jason Wilcox and the board rather than the turgid sh*te he was serving up on the pitch.",

      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",

      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £11bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",
      "",
      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper seemed weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, or that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield. They also knew, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "Sacking Amorim has solved this one – a temporary fix – with Kobbie Mainoo brought in from the cold to partner Casemiro, whom the football never left after all. But Amorim might say he was sacked because of an arse-about-face recruitment policy that saw United fail to furnish him with the players necessary to make his precious system work, all the while buying an entirely new forward line.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end, saving Ratcliffe a few quid in compo.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must have spent the subsequent 14 months p*ssing himself as that disruption continued unabated until and beyond the Portuguese manager’s demise.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation and games coming thick as well as fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim had, and that it cannot counter well over a year of underperformance, even with hundreds of millions spent.",
      "Amorim told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, both parties would definitely choose the latter.",
      "But ultimately the failure of Amorim can be tracked back to Ratcliffe and his peers in the boardroom. They rushed through appointing him in November 2024 and sacked him in January 2026, spending pretty much every intervening second trying to convince themselves publicly and privately that they had cracked it while actually writing off at least a couple of seasons and likely far more considering how so many of their decisions on the playing squad alone were inextricably tied to suiting the ideals of an obstinate head coach who is no longer there.",
      "Add it to the extensive personal list of Ratcliffe’s football ownership “cock-ups”. Someone get him a copy of Football Manager so he can get all this out of his system.",
      "",
      "Just as United were moving past Amorim and, for once, starting to build some positive momentum on the pitch, Sir Jim decided to go Farmer Jim by claiming the UK has been ‘colonised by immigrants’ while also taking aim at those receiving state support.",
      "“You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It’s costing too much money.",
      "“The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn’t it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it’s 70 million. That’s 12 million people.”",
      "Except, it’s not. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. We can all make up numbers, fella.",
      "And if we’re talking about benefits, Brexit Jim has taken a few handouts himself, including a £120million public subsidy in December for INEOS, Ratcliffe’s company that holds £1.75billion in cash while he sits on an £11billion personal fortune.",
      "Maybe Ratcliffe lost track of the population figures for 2020 since it was the same year he quit the UK, moving his tax domicile to tax-free Monaco, saving himself an estimated £4billion.",
      "It is the ‘colonised by immigrants’ take that has caused most controversy, with even the Prime Minister taking an uncharacteristically decisive stance, calling for the billionaire to apologise. Arf.",
      "We’re still not sure what the question was that Ratcliffe was answering. He sat down with Sky News in Belgium to talk about the state of the chemicals sector. Ed Conway seemed genuinely astonished by Ratcliffe’s tone, described by Manchester mayor Andy Burnham as ‘insulting and inflammatory’.",
      "It hasn’t gone down well with United fans’ groups either, but very little of what Ratcliffe has done since getting into bed with the Glazers has been warmly received beyond the boardroom at Old Trafford.",
      "Many are asking what the foreigners in the dressing room might make of Ratcliffe’s views. Our guess: they probably won’t even notice. But that’s not who the words seem to be aimed at. They were a gift for Nigel Farage and those who see profit in sowing further division, and a betrayal of the socialist roots of a club Ratcliffe claimed to support before coming to see it as an investment vehicle.",

      "Postecoglou has made a well-timed appearance on The Overlap, which followed the announcement of Frank‘s exit from the north London club.",
      "The former Celtic and Nottingham Forest boss exited Spurs at the end of last season, with their dire Premier League form deemed unacceptable despite their Europa League triumph.",
      "Frank was appointed to steady the ship, but they were arguably even worse during his tenure. He departed with them only five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.",
      "Now, Postecoglou has spoken on why he thinks Spurs are “not a big club”, revealing four signings he wants to make.",
      "“It is curious in terms of understanding what are they trying to build. They have an unbelievable stadium and training facilities, but when you look at their expenditure and wages structure, they are not a big club,” Postecoglou said on The Overlap.",
      "READ: Who will be next Tottenham manager now Thomas Frank is sacked? ‘Arry and Ange back in top 10",
      "“I saw that because when we tried to sign players, we were not in the market for those players. There are certain players… at the end of my first year when we finished fifth, we had to sign Premier League ready players to go from fifth to challenging.",
      "“But we didn’t qualify for the Champions League so we ended up signing Dominic Solanke, who I really liked, and three teenagers.",

      "“Thomas is walking in… what’s his objective? What’s the club’s objective? At the start of the year they said they wanted to compete on all front, well the club hasn’t competed on all fronts for a very long time.",

      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have a ‘chosen replacement’ for Thomas Frank after they were ‘pushed’ to land Roberto De Zerbi ‘in November’.",
      "Thomas Frank wasn’t turning the Tottenham tanker around, he was sinking it. ‘Transitional seasons’ are real and exist, but this was never one of them.",
      "The reasons Spurs finally felt ‘forced’ to sack Thomas Frank have been revealed, from his Arsenal obsession to a meeting which ‘shocked’ new signings."

      "…I’m sorry, but I don’t believe Ratcliffe is a fit and proper person to own a premier league football club. A league that has built its reputation off the back of the world’s best players coming to our country to play. A league that is marketed around the world, that has fans from Lagos to Lapland, Patagonia to the Philippines. I don’t see why anyone in this country should have to listen to some tax avoiding billionaire telling us about the decline of this country. A country that is struggling partly because of a billionaire class of people not paying their fair share and who flee to Monaco.",
      "I feel sorry for United fans. I bet 99% don’t have a bigoted bone in their body. You can’t if some of your greatest players are Cantona and Ronaldo. And for the global fanbase, I’m sorry. To the people who get up at stupid o’clock to watch the team they love, only to be told that people like them is what is ruining the country their club play in. And to the people who get annoyed by rainbow laces and woke-ism who cry ‘keep politics out of football’ – I hope you’re vocal here too. I hope you tell Ratcliffe to shut his pie hole and stick to football.",

      "Now, what has this got to do with football?",
      "Well, I’m reminded of this every time in the past few days F365 have written about the Man Utd fan not having a hair cut until they have won 5 on the trot. Each dig at the story makes me imagine Sarah, whilst conducting a meeting with her staff, asks that no one mentions Hair boy, and that she did mention it once but got away with it.",
      "It’s just that having made a big deal about how annoyed you are with him, you do seem to talk about him a lot. Of course, if I was a cynical middle aged man (which some would say I am) I’d say AI has found that you get a 2.6% increase in traffic to the website if you make a dig at Hair Boy.",
      "Anyway, back to Man Utd. Ashmundo from Wednesday morning probably had his email in his drafts ready to send the very second they dropped points as he wanted to do some kind of gotcha moment. Newsflash; Teams drop points. No one wins every single game.",
      "Man City dropped points to Spurs recently so is that proof Pep is not very good and should be removed?",
      "In the same way it is absurd to think Carrick should be the next full time head coach after the first 4 wins, it’s equally absurd to say a draw away at an improved, well oiled team like West Ham is proof he’s not good enough. Every potential choice has pros and cons. We’ve also tried every possible type from the proven winners, to the club legend to the next big thing coach who did great in another league. None have reached the heights demanded/expected.",
      "Perhaps we should lower those expectations and realise at the very best, at this moment in time, they can only get Top 4 if everything goes to plan? Instead of always thinking the next manager is the Messiah who is going to bring the league title back, plan to be a top 4 team, THEN look at building towards the title – and this could be a change in manager.",
      "The other thing people keep forgetting is that INEOS have declared a wish to have a recruitment plan based around the club and not a manager (the signings made under Amorim already show this as any worries about being 3-4-3 players have been forgotten now they play 4-2-3-1) . This indicates (and reports have said Amorim got pissy over not having a say) that they want a head coach who doesn’t have a say in recruitment (final say on a player for example).",
      "This could very well be a Carrick or an Ole and not an Enrique or Tuchel. And as a fan, I just want to enjoy my club play football and under Carrick that is something I have done for the first time since Ole was in charge (apart from that 3-4 month period Rashford was flying during Ten Hag’s first season). Other fans will have different feelings and that is their right.",
      "So, lets just wait and see. Carrick could end up going on a huge losing run and be out of the running. Or he could get back to winning ways and get top 4 and champions league and for all we know, get hired and bring the title back. He has as much chance as others who all have cons.

There is one simple fact, and that fact is, United have only two things to play for this season, the CL qualification spots, and that guy getting a haircut. There are no cups, no nothing left in this early disaster of a season, and the fact that if and when United do end up getting 5 wins in a row, it will get more hype than when City won the treble. That shows two different sides of a coin, how big and massive United are and everything they do is always at a different level. And the level that United are that this is their biggest aim they can have currently..",
      "And for a website that cries about how the game has gotten away from the fans (lookin at you Johnny), there is sure a lot of crying about a fan making it big through passion, support and genuine intentions with no clickbaiting or spreading of hate Always rather have this guy be rich and famous than any of the AFTV clowns and other clickbaiting channels and fans of each club.",

      "Clearly I must have imagined the amount of underserved/unexplainable injury time granted to Liverpool earlier in the season, for example when they robbed points late on against Newcastle and Burnley. The running joke being the additional time added on to help Liverpool on a number of occasions, whereas if their opponent needed a goal the ref blows up after 2 mins.",
      "Then we have a full house of scouse bingo: net spend (which morphed into net squad – they have one less player for goodness sake!), injuries (no other team has them), Salah going to AFCON (no other team lost players, ignoring this is probably a benefit given his current form), Isak being injured (shock as injury-prone player gets injured), all their bad luck (ignoring all their good luck), blaming VAR (they obviously get called LiVARpool for nothing), being somewhat remarkably punished for every error and the opposition scoring every time with their first chance of the game (why won’t the universe give them a break?!).",

What you get one night may be different than what you get the next. While we’re at it, can we just bin this hand ball rule in the penalty box when it’s clearly ball to hand and the player doesn’t know a thing about it.

It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup. It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud.",

      "Thursday 12 February 2026 16:50, UK",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he is \"sorry that my choice of language has offended some people\" after claiming Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants who are draining resources from the state.",
      "In an interview with Sky News, Ratcliffe, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, warned Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine-million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.",
      "\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58m in 2020, now it's 70m. That's 12m people.\"",
      "However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates the population of the UK was 67m in mid-2020 and 70m in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9m in 2000.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, Ratcliffe said: \"I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.",
      "\"My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.",
      "\"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.\"",
      "In the wake of Ratcliffe's apology, United released a statement saying the club \"prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club\" before noting that \"equality, diversity and inclusion\" has been embedded into everything the club does.",
      "Without mentioning Ratcliffe by name, the Old Trafford club said:",
      "\"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters reflect the history and heritage of Manchester, a city that anyone can call home.",
      "\"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.\"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\"",
      "The FA is understood to be looking into Ratcliffe's comments. English football's governing body will assess Ratcliffe's interview with Sky News to ascertain if his comments breached FA regulations.",
      "Should the FA choose to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour.",
      "The rule states: \"A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute or use any one, or a combination of, violent conduct, serious foul play, threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour.\"",
      "Rule E3.2 states that a breach of Rule E3.1 would be considered an \"aggravated breach\" where it includes a reference, whether express or implied, to any one or more of the following - ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality, religion or belief, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation or disability.",
      "Ratcliffe, as a club co-owner, is subject to FA rules as a participant.",
      "Ratcliffe - who is a resident of Monaco - also signalled Prime Minister Keir Starmer might not be the right person for the job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or he's maybe too nice. I mean, Keir is a nice man.",
      "\"I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the leader of right-wing party Reform UK, saying: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man and I think he's got good intentions.",
      "\"But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Referring to his role at United, Ratcliffe added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\"",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off.",
      "\"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular and show some courage.\"",
      "Ratcliffe was talking on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, at which leaders from many of Europe's biggest economies, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz, are meeting with industrialists to discuss the fate of its economy.",
      "The summit comes amid a spate of closures across the European chemicals sector, closures that indicate, in the INEOS founder's view, that the European chemicals sector is facing \"unsurvivable conditions\".",
      "Downing Street says Ratcliffe was \"absolutely right\" to apologise for his language over immigration.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called on Ratcliffe to say sorry for comments he described as \"offensive and wrong\" on Wednesday evening.",
      "Following Ratcliffe's apology, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson said: \"The PM asked for an apology and one has been issued. Absolutely right.",
      "\"There should be debate on immigration, but Britain was built for all and the comments were divisive.\"",
      "\"In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it's worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fanbase and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.",
      "\"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football and we believe most fans will feel the same.\"",
      "The Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club are also unhappy with Ratcliffe's interview, saying they are \"deeply concerned\" and warning his words could have \"real-world consequences\".",

If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular and show some courage.\"",
      "Ratcliffe was talking on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, at which leaders from many of Europe's biggest economies, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz, are meeting with industrialists to discuss the fate of its economy.",
      "The summit comes amid a spate of closures across the European chemicals sector, closures that indicate, in the INEOS founder's view, that the European chemicals sector is facing \"unsurvivable conditions\".",
      "The Prime Minister responded to Sky News' interview with Ratcliffe on X, calling his comments \"offensive and wrong\".",
      "Starmer added: \"Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\"",
      "\"In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it's worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fanbase and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.",
      "\"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football and we believe most fans will feel the same.\"",
      "The Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club are also unhappy with Ratcliffe's interview, saying they are \"deeply concerned\" and warning his words could have \"real-world consequences\"."

      "Michael Carrick's unbeaten start to life as Man Utd head coach won't see the club accelerate their plans moving forward; Carrick has won four of his opening five games in charge; should United secure Champions League qualification, Carrick may become a frontrunner for the job",
      "Wednesday 11 February 2026 19:28, UK",
      "They may not have gotten the result they wanted against West Ham, but Manchester United remain unbeaten in Michael Carrick's five games in charge. Under his stewardship, the team has beaten Arsenal and Manchester City already.",
      "Nevertheless, the club's bosses will not accelerate their plans to appoint a new head coach, and Carrick is still not the favourite to be the next long-term boss at Old Trafford.",
      "To understand why, you need to drill down into the new, determined philosophy at the heart of the club.",
      "United will make no decision about the top job right now. As Gary Neville suggested, the hierarchy has begun the process of identifying possible targets. But it has been made clear to me they have not yet spoken to any candidates, and they will wait until the end of the season before progressing with an appointment.",
      "In Carrick (and in Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Trevor Binnion and Jonny Evans) the team is in very good hands, and so that has placated the bosses into feeling there is no rush to make the next decision.",
      "Yes, there is a growing clamour from some supporters - and some pundits - for Carrick to be given the job right now. He is handling the media consummately. The mood is high. The players are happy, and enjoy training. The team is performing very well. Results are well and truly on the up.",
      "But to commit to a long-term appointment now would go against everything that United are determined their operation should be: calm, considered, strategic. There will be no short-term fixes, and certainly no decisions as important as the next head coach, made on the limited evidence of just five games.",
      "The same resolute, methodical policy was there for all to see with United's January transfer activity. Despite Ruben Amorim bemoaning his injury problems, AFCON absentees and a lack of squad depth, not one single player was signed as \"cover\" in the January transfer window. And there were no new incomings either once Carrick took charge. United are keeping their powder dry - and their transfer kitty full - for a central midfield transfer onslaught in the summer. That's the plan, and they're sticking to it.",
      "Back to the head coach. Certainly, the bosses are delighted with the job Carrick is doing, and with the dynamic between the key members of his coaching staff. And if he continues to do well - and especially if he delivers Champions League football - he will certainly be one of the front runners come the summer. Such are the standards that he has set, and the impression that he has made that, even if he misses out on the job at Old Trafford, he can only have enhanced his reputation, and his chances of getting another Premier League manager's role, in the future.",
      "Ironically, if Carrick does deliver Champions League qualification over the final 12 games, he may inadvertently stiffen the competition he will face for the top job that. The United manager's role does not have the same appeal now that it had in the years immediately after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. But United playing again in the top European club competition, with the big boost in the finances to boot? That may make the job much more attractive to some of the elite managers in world football.",
      "To that end, it's been made clear to me that United are determined to appoint someone who has the strength of character and experience to cope with all that is thrown at you as the main man at Old Trafford.",
      "The feeling among the hierarchy is that the job was too big for Amorim. He was surprised by the sheer noise which came with the role. That wasn't the case with his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, but there have been learnings from his tenure too. On both occasions, United felt they'd achieved a coup in recruiting the brightest manager in Europe of that particular era. Neither was a success at Manchester United.",
      "That sort of candidate is not on the wanted list this time. If it isn't Carrick, it is very likely to be one of the biggest names in world football - assuming United can persuade that man to join.",
      "The likes of Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti have the wow factor, the stellar name, the track record of winning multiple major trophies. Carrick can't compete with them on that level, but he out-scores them both when it comes to knowing Old Trafford, and the \"Manchester United way\".",
      "Carrick will happily work within the current United structure, which isn't about to change. Might Tuchel or Ancelotti want more of a say in transfer dealings, for example, than Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada are prepared to give? We should not forget that United's recent managerial past includes some huge football names. Neither Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal were considered a success. That is a lingering memory.",
      "Carrick has made a sensational start to his time as Manchester United head coach. Whether he gets the chance to continue the role beyond the summer has much to do with how the team performs under his charge between now and May - but also on the basis of many, many more factors.",
      "Whatever happens, United's bosses will not make a quick decision.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 21:42, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 20:59, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",
