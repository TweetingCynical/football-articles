      "Axel Tuanzebe is suing Manchester United for alleged “clinical negligence” regarding the “medical advice” they gave him, having left the club two years ago.",
      "The 27-year-old came through the ranks in Manchester, but was plagued by injuries for much of his time and was never able to nail down a first-team spot.",
      "Tuanzebe joined the club aged eight and went on to skipper them at junior level. He made his senior debut in January 2017 but in the six-and-a-half years than followed he would make just 37 appearances.",
      "The defender's first major issue came when he suffered a hip injury during the warm-up before a Premier League stalemate with Liverpool in October 2019. He was later ruled out for the rest of the season after injuring himself in a Carabao Cup victory over Colchester United two months later.",
      "He had another lengthy spell on the sidelines at the beginning of 2022/23 season and did not return to training until the New Year. Tuanzebe finally enjoyed a length run of games when he joined Ipswich, making more than 40 appearances after establishing himself as their first-choice right-back.",
      "When United did confirm Tuanzebe's exit they had only positive things to say about a player whom they'd had on their books for just shy of two decades.",
      "It read: “His departure is an emotional one for the player and many at the club who have known and helped nurture him over the years. A fine character, he leaves United universally respected as a credit to himself and his family.",
      "\"Everyone at the club would like to extend our best wishes to Axel as he embarks upon the next chapter of his career. We would also like to thank him for always representing Manchester United with class and dignity.”",
      "The DR Congo international had loan spells at Aston Villa, where he won the Championship play-off finals, Napoli and Stoke City earlier in his career. Tuanzebe previously helped Ipswich land promotion to the Premier League, but left when his deal ended and has now signed with Burnley, who themselves are preparing for a year in the top flight after finishing second in the Championship.",

      "Manchester United legend Darren Fletcher is the new coach of the club's Under-18s side, his fifth different title at the club.",

      "Fletcher is now trying to follow in Ferguson's footsteps by guiding United's young players, and he's determined to help as many of them advance towards Ruben Amorim's first-team as possible.",

      "\"I’m looking forward to working with such a talented age-group; supporting them to reach their potential and preparing them to enjoy careers at the highest level possible.”",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox added: “We are delighted that Darren will lead our Under-18s group. He knows exactly what it takes to be a successful Academy graduate and has played a key role in shaping the pathway for so many of our young players in recent years.",
      "“Darren’s excellent relationships across the entire staff will only increase the strong connection between the Academy and first team, further enhancing our ability to produce world-class players ready to excel at Manchester United.”",
      "The appointment comes after Fletcher survived Amorim's overhaul when he was appointed as United's first-team manager in November last year.",
      "Amorim brought in several of his own coaches to fulfil roles with the senior team, and as a result he dismissed United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had been serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag and took over the reins when Ten Hag was sacked.",
      "A hugely popular figure with fans, there was initially some disquiet among supporters about Van Nistelrooy being dismissed from the club while Fletcher - who has undertaken a variety of roles at United since the end of his playing days - stayed on.",
      "Van Nistelrooy moved on to Leicester City as the club's head coach, but he oversaw their relegation from the Premier League before being sacked last week.",
      "After playing, Fletcher first returned to United in October 2020 as under-16s coach, before further roles as first-team coach and technical director.",

      "The England under-17 international can play in the centre of defence or at left-back. Kukonki played 14 times for United's under-18 side and in the Premier League 2 play-offs as United defeated Everton and West Ham before losing in the semi-final against rivals Manchester City.",
      "Amorim was quickly impressed with Kukonki's physicality upon his arrival and commended the defender's maturity. \"He's 16,\" said the boss to MUTV.",
      "\"But he impressed me a lot, so it's also a sign to the youth players that they can be here.",
      "\"If something happened with the first-team squad, they have to step up and I think he's ready, he's very adult to handle the demands of the Premier League.\"",

      "It is said Kukonki's ambition is to push for his United debut despite his tender age after making his way through the age groups at the club. The Stoke-on-Trent born prospect has already drawn early comparisons with Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol.",
      "Kukonki could still become the youngest defender to ever represent United at a senior level in the league. No United defender has ever played in the Premier League before turning 18.",

      "Those frustrations were magnified by the fact Amorim played a unique 3-4-3 system, which he didn't have the players to do, yet stuck to his beliefs anyway. Ashley Young insists now is the time for the manager to lay down an early marker to prove he is the man to take the club forward.",

I don't think anyone can give him anymore excuses, it is now or never. He's got to have a good pre-season, workout what his best team is, what players fit into the system. Unless he's going to change, but you can't see him change the formation.\"",

      "The Premier League champions were eager to make a statement after sealing their 20th top-flight crown and so pulled out all the stops to seal a deal for the ambitious 22-year-old.",
      "After months of speculation, and fighting off the likes of Bayern Munich and Manchester City to land his signature, Wirtz joined Liverpool last month in a deal that could be worth a British-record fee of £116 million.",

      "Despite the eye-watering fee, the four-time Bundesliga champion believes the deal represents excellent value for his former club due to the Wirtz's clear class - claiming that even if Liverpool's bitter rivals Manchester United signed the playmaker, he would still echo the same sentiments.",
      "\"Florian Wirtz is easily the best signing of the summer transfer window so far,\" Babbel told Gameshub. “That was the deal of the year in my opinion and that isn’t just because the Premier League champions signed him; if Man United had made the deal, it would be no different – he’s a fantastic player that will add so much value to the team.",
      "\"No one was talking about Liverpool getting the deal done either! Everyone assumed he’d join Bayern Munich, Man City or Real Madrid.

      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has rejected the chance to join former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo at Saudi side Al-Nassr, according to reports.",
      "Garnacho looks certain to leave Old Trafford this summer after his row with manager Ruben Amorim, who irked the player by dropping him for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "The Argentine also risked the wrath of the club as he slammed their 2024-25 season as \"s***\" after the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst season in top flight history.",
      "Garnacho is one of five players who were allowed extra time before returning to pre-season training in order to find new clubs, but he has since come back into the fold at Carrington among the first team squad.",
      "The 21-year-old is still intent on a move but has snubbed the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Nassr, as reported by the Telegraph, because he wants to prioritise a European club.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea are among the teams who have been linked with a move for Garnacho in the past, with ESPN also claiming he has \"firm interest\" from teams in Germany.",
      "Joining Al-Nassr would have reunited Garnacho with Ronaldo, a player he idolised while the two were briefly at United together.",
      "Garnacho has previously been seen copying Ronaldo's trademark 'siiiuu' celebration on the pitch and the pair shared a close relationship during the Portuguese legend's two years back at United between 2021-22 and 2022-23.",
      "But it appears Garnacho is not ready to give up the chance of playing top level football in Europe, following the lead of United captain Bruno Fernandes - who snubbed interest from Al-Hilal because he wanted to continue with the elite for as long as possible.",
      "The Telegraph report goes on to say that United are still happy for Garnacho to pursue a move away from the club but are said to have placed a £60million price tag on him - which may put off some suitors.",
      "However, the Daily Express have claimed that some United figures have conceded they may have to settle for a bid closer to £45m in order to clear him off their books.",
      "Garnacho initially started his career in the Atletico Madrid academy before joining United's youth system in 2020, making his first senior appearance the following year. He has made a total of 144 appearances for United, scoring 26 times.",

      "Aston Villa have been watching their wallets in the transfer window so far, but a vital summer looms. Unai Emery's men will again play European football for the upcoming campaign.",
      "Wounds were licked on the last day of the past Premier League season when the Villans missed out on Champions League football and the funds that accompany it under cruel circumstances away to Manchester United.",
      "However, they will grace the Europa League for the upcoming term, and the club will have to prepare accordingly this summer. UEFA has thrown a slight spanner in the works, fining the club £9.5million for breaching financial rules and imposing a sporting sanction.",
      "Marco Asencio and Marcus Rashford's loan signings proved instrumental in Emery's side enjoying a stellar campaign last year. They’ll leave behind a gaping hole if not signed permanently, which at the moment looks unlikely.",
      "As per Gazzetta dello Sport, Asencio is reportedly being targeted by Inter Milan, Champions League finalists, and Rashford's potential PSR hit looks to be just out of the Villans' reach. So, attacking reinforcements may be top of the club's list when spending commences, with only youngster Zepiqueno Redmond signed so far, and a surprise target has emerged in the form of Barcelona's Ferran Torres.",
      "Reports in Spain suggest that the Catalan giants would be willing to accept a fee in the region of £43m for the 25-year-old former Manchester City winger. Former Villa scout Bryan King informed Villa News that Emery could also be key in forcing through a prospective deal.",
      "\"I think Emery will be a big factor,\" he stated. \"The promise of regular first-team football, working under a Spanish manager and Spanish coaching staff. Life at Villa would be quite enjoyable, I think, for Torres.\"",
      "In terms of exits, Emi Martinez is expected to leave Villa Park this window. The 32-year-old World Cup winner has been a goliath between the sticks for Villa, but Manchester United and Atletico Madrid have been mooted as likely destinations.",
      "Should Martinez, who left the Villans' final home game in tears last season in what looked like a goodbye, head out the exit door, then securing the signature of a competent replacement will be a priority.",
      "Chevalier is valued at around £40m and kept 11 clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season, the second most in the French top flight, as his side finished in fifth.",
      "One area where the Villans are not lacking is at left-back. Lucas Digne arrived from Everton in January 2022, and while at times he has looked sub-par, his set-piece abilities and pinpoint crosses can be lethal.",
      "Last summer, Ian Maatsen was brought in from Chelsea. He had spent the previous campaign on loan with Borussia Dortmund, where he made the Champions League final.",
      "Emery rotated both, favouring Digne, who seems to come alive in the face of competition, last season, but rumours suggest the French full-back could be leaving Villa Park in the coming months, with Atletico Madrid a potential suitor says The Times.",
      "The 31-year-old is in the final year of his current contract, and while he has been consistent for Villa, getting his wages off the books and receiving a fee for a player who may walk on a free next summer could be smart, considering that Maatsen is waiting in the wings.",
      "With Jhon Duran sold in January, Villa favourite Ollie Watkins led the line for most of the season and mustered 16 league goals, an impressive total despite being three less than he managed the previous term.",
      "Unlike Digne, he is contracted to Villa until 2028, but, having reached the age of 29 and with the likes of United sniffing around with big money to offer, he has been linked with a move away from the West Midlands.",
      "A fee of £60m has been bandied around, but the role that Watkins plays under Emery, not even taking into consideration his goal output, should render him relatively priceless. Watkins is a workaholic.",
      "While his finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, the ground he covers not just through the centre but also out wide is vital to Villa's play. With no Rashford to force him onto the bench, he could string together some impressive performances next season in Europe and domestically, while replacing him with an unknown entity could hinder what is a vital campaign.",

      "Their north London rivals Tottenham have sealed the £55m arrival of Mohammed Kudus. And Manchester United are still yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With seven weeks left before deadline day, there's plenty of time to negotiate down asking prices. After all, you don't get if you don't ask.",
      "Where else can you start but with Arsenal's laughable £40m+£1 stunt. After hearing about a supposed release clause in Luis Suarez's Liverpool contract, the Gunners submitted an offer that was one Great British pound over the sum in order to activate it in 2013.",
      "They were left with egg on their face when it turned out that it only required a potential move to be merely discussed, and wasn't a fully-fledged release clause. The bid was therefore swiftly rejected.",
      "It was much to the humour of Reds owner John W. Henry, whose iconic tweet remains on the platform, now X, to this day: \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\" Suarez, meanwhile, was convinced to commit to Anfield for another year by Steven Gerrard, before joining Barcelona in a £75m deal the following year.",
      "Doing business with one of your closest and fiercest rivals is never going to be straightforward, and there's often going to be an extra charge compared to if the player is being sold abroad. But Chelsea went the other way when they made a very cheeky attempt to sign Luka Modric from Spurs in 2011.",
      "They opened with a bid of £22m for Modric, who'd moved to White Hart Lane from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.6m three years earlier. His boss Harry Redknapp fumed: \"That is ridiculous. There are people being sold for £20m who are not fit to lace Luka's boots.\"",
      "Stamford Bridge chiefs did respond by upping their offer. But they were unable to hijack Real Madrid's move 12 months later, with the Croatian heading to the Spanish capital for around £30m – a sum that proved to be a steal.",
      "Clint Dempsey was coming off the season of his life in the summer of 2012 having scored 23 goals and registered seven assists in all competitions for Fulham. So you can forgive them for not rolling over when Liverpool came calling to the tune of just £3m.",
      "The Reds were very much in the midst of their banter era and their refusal to go any further than £4m once again left their rivals laughing at them. Although they did maybe dodge something of a bullet.",
      "Dempsey ultimately joined Spurs on deadline day for £6m. A return of 12 goals and seven assists was respectable enough, but he headed home to his native USA after just one season to join Seattle Sounders.",
      "Perhaps this should have been taken as a sign of things to come... United have been quite frankly tragic in the transfer market for over a decade, dating back to Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "When David Moyes took the reins, he was keen to bring with him some of Everton's most prized assets. His former club were in no mood to help him out when they received a £28m offer – for both Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines!",
      "\"Those bids were immediately rejected out of hand as derisory and insulting,\" a spokesperson for the Toffees slammed. It says it all about United's transfer nous that they then signed just Fellaini on deadline day for just £500k less than the joint bid.",
      "While all of the above have been intentionally insulting, Manchester City can be slightly excused here on the basis that they accidentally bid £30m for Lionel Messi. Although it does make it all the more embarrassing on their part.",
      "Former City executive Garry Cook explained the mix-up in ‘The Manchester City Years’ by Gary James. Sheikh Mansour had just completed his £210m takeover of the club in August 2009, with chiefs – located in Manchester, London and Abu Dhabi – scrambling to sign a forward before the window slammed shut.",
      "After failed swoops for Fernando Torres and Dimitar Berbatov, Cook explained: “He (an executive) made a comment like, ‘It’s all getting messy.’ Via the telephones and other communication lines, this somehow translated into, ‘Get Messi.’ An offer was made for Lionel Messi of about £30million. Needless to say, it was rejected.”",
      "Cherry picking a relegated club's top talent is always a fun exercise for the Premier League's big boys, who know full well the selling club are bent over a barrel. But there's still a line – and Spurs well and truly crossed that two years ago.",
      "Leicester City had one of the most stacked squads a relegated Premier League team has ever seen, and James Maddison and Harvey Barnes were both destined for big moves. £50m for both of them, however, was never going to fly.",
      "Maddison did end up signing on the ever-shameless Daniel Levy's dotted line, but he cost £40m alone, while Newcastle signed Barnes for £38m. Hey, you were nearly two thirds of the way there lads.",

      "Tottenham are still hopeful they can wrap up a deal for Morgan Gibbs-White despite a furious row with his club Nottingham Forest over claims the London side illegally tapped the player up.",
      "Spurs looked nailed on to sign the 25-year-old after triggering his £60million release clause, with a medical lined up for the England international. But Forest came firing back and claimed they had not given permission for Tottenham to speak to the player and were consulting with their lawyers over a possible breach of confidentiality regarding the release clause.",

Rashford is in the wilderness in the summer transfer window, having been told he doesn’t feature in Ruben Amorim’s plans at Manchester United, but without an exit route lined up.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a long spell at Aston Villa. While his brief loan spell at Villa ended in injury, Rashford still managed to revitalise his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances.",
      "But things have moved slowly, largely due to the financial situation at play. Rashford is paid £325,000 per week at United, where he is under contract until June 2028, and Barca do not have the money available to match those terms.",
      "United would like to sell to whoever will match their £40million asking price, so will have been excited to hear of interest from the Saudi Pro League. However, Rashford has vetoed a move to the Middle East, according to Mundo Deportivo, who say he is waiting on Barca."

      "Alejandro Garnacho is another man who could be on his way out as the club look to bolster their funds with a No 9 thought to be on their shopping list. A dire Premier League underlined the need to change the look of the squad and here's the latest news coming out of Manchester.",

      "The Cameroonian has made no secret of his desire to move on and take up the opportunity at the Premier League giants, who are trying to land more firepower in a bid to get them back up the table. His latest move on Instagram has appeared to underline his motivation to move on.",
      "He liked Yoro's post despite the pair having no prior involvement as team-mates. The Frenchman put up a post that read: \"ReUnited\" alongside an image of him going through his paces and Mbeumo was among those to like the post, along with current Old Trafford stars Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot.",

      "Haaland and Kane are cause for great regret. United missed out on the former in December 2019 and did not have the nerve to go for the latter two years ago. Since Haaland moved to Borussia Dortmund, the only reputable strikers United have bought were Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, aged 33 and 36 at the time of their arrivals. Each only cut it for one season.",

      "Sancho has the freedom of movement to find himself a new club, most likely in Italy, a dumping ground for Premier League clubs for several years. Chelsea opted to buy Jamie Gittens, another winger bred in the Manchester City academy who defected to Borussia Dortmund, rather than Sancho. Gittens is five years Sancho's junior.",
      "Ten Hag was ordered to briefly reintegrate Sancho last summer, without the desired apology. He managed the situation respectably and United got Sancho out of the door on transfer deadline day.",

      "Pini Zahavi's Gol International agency contacted Garnacho's representatives at Leaders, run by Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas. However, Cambeiro is intent on facilitating a move without any assistance.",
      "Zahavi has long had links with Chelsea and Gol International represents the club's forward, Christopher Nkunku. Chelsea floated the possibility of a swap deal involving Nkunku and Garnacho again last month but United are not keen on the France international.",
      "High-profile intermediaries occasionally become involved in negotiations to engineer a transfer if representatives are inexperienced. Jorge Mendes played a small but significant role in Bruno Fernandes' move to United from Sporting in January 2020.",
      "Cambeiro has represented Garnacho since he moved to United from Atletico Madrid's academy in October 2020. Cambeiro and De Lucas, who spent one season at Chelsea in 2002-03, visited Stamford Bridge in January when the Club World Cup winners considered submitting a bid for Garnacho.",
      "Chelsea have signed winger Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund and are on the verge of selling Noni Madueke to Arsenal. Garnacho is one of four wingers United want to sell before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "United agreed with Garnacho for him not to report for pre-season training last week amid his desire to leave the club. Garnacho almost certainly will not be included in their pre-season tour squad that departs for Chicago next Tuesday.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are also planning to leave United this summer. Rashford has conducted individual sessions at United's Carrington training complex and arrived eight minutes after head coach Ruben Amorim left on Friday. Rashford arrived via the rear entrance whereas Amorim drove out through the front.",
      "Antony is prepared to take a pay cut to end his three-year stint at United while Sancho's representatives have held discussions with Italian clubs."

      "Darren Fletcher has occupied four roles within six years at Manchester United: ambassador, technical director, first team coach and now under 18s coach.",
      "Fletcher was a conduit between the academy and the first team for several years, recommending which teenagers were suitable for first-team training on an ad hoc basis if a player was injured or the squad was depleted amid internationals.",
      "He is a regular at Leigh Sports Village and was one of the few senior figures in attendance for United's high-profile FA Youth Cup ties against Chelsea, Arsenal and Aston Villa last season.",
      "Fletcher, 41, had a 20-year association with United as a player and has been a full-time staff member for four-and-a-half years. He is eminently suitable for his first managerial role on the basis of his playing and coaching experiences at the club.",
      "Beyond that, Fletcher is approachable, articulate and likeable. He will be an invaluable sounding board for young players who are sidelined for an inordinate period, having recovered from a debilitating case of ulcerative colitis that wiped a year off his career.",
      "Fletcher's twin sons, Jack and Tyler, defected from the Manchester City academy to United's in 2023 but they are now ineligible to feature for the under 18s, which partly influenced their father's decision to take charge.",
      "Fletcher took a back seat as Jack and Tyler mulled over their futures two years ago and which national side to represent. Jack chose England and Tyler is a Scotland youth international.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson had recommended Fletcher to replace Nick Cox as the director of academy but Fletcher's long-term ambition is to become a first team manager. This move should strengthen his CV. Kieran McKenna, now Ipswich Town manager, was the United U18 coach before Jose Mourinho promoted him to the first team dugout in 2016.",
      "Fletcher is due to work closely with Travis Binnion, the head of player development and coaching who oversees the under 21s. United have also allocated Fletcher a key leadership role in the academy that will oversee all of the age groups.",
      "United maintain the priority with academy talents will be player development and not results."

      "Speaking to L'Equipe, the Swede said:",
      "Maybe [I will leave]. That’s football, you never know. I don’t think about it; we’ll see what happens. If something happens, it will. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me. It’s one of the biggest leagues (Premier League) in Europe. I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it’s something I’d like to do. It would be great revenge.",
      "According to the Daily Telegraph, Garnacho has rejected the chance to sign permanently for Al Nassr this summer.",
      "It is believed that Ronaldo's team tried to persuade the Argentine to join them for their Saudi Pro League title pursuit.",
      "However, Garnacho's aim is to stay in the Premier League and is unwilling to move to the Middle East at this stage.",
      "There is a clear reason behind that, and it all stems from the valuation Sporting have for Gyokeres.",
      "The Swede was under the impression that should a bid of £52m plus £8.67m in add-ons was to be submitted, he would be allowed to leave the Lisbon club.",
      "While Varandas agrees that holding out for his £85m release clause would not be possible, he is also unwilling to let the striker leave for that little.",

      "In the latest twist in the Gyokeres saga, the striker has been issued with disciplinary action from Sporting after failing to arrive for pre-season training.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas sent a clear message to the striker on Saturday:",
      "We're calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group. If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years. If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.",

      "After announcing they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window last month, Manchester United finalised the deal just 11 days later.",
      "It was United's way of laying down an early marker and confirming they meant business this summer. In between triggering Cunha's £62.5million release clause and unveiling him as their first summer signing, they also tabled their opening offer for Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United saw their opening offer of £55m turned down for the Cameroon international, but a second bid, understood to be in excess of £60m, looked as though it would be enough to lure him to Old Trafford.",
      "However, despite this publication confirming a deal was close almost three weeks ago, negotiations between United and Brentford remain ongoing. Both the Reds and the attacker are equally keen to get a deal over the line.",
      "With just over a week to go until the squad will fly to the United States for their pre-season tour, United are in a race against time to ensure Mbeumo gets a place on the plane. New signings have linked up with the squad mid-tour before, such as Andre Onana two years ago, but it would be ideal to have Mbeumo in place beforehand.",
      "United have rightly prioritised attacking signings this summer and the addition of Cunha, who scored 17 goals across all competitions last season, marked an excellent start. However, the Brazilian's addition to the squad so early in the window immediately raised the benchmark.",
      "Having been in discussions with Brentford for more than a month, some United fans are becoming frustrated. Some are even suggesting the club should abandon their pursuit.",
      "In addition to wanting to sign Mbeumo, United are also prioritising the addition of a striker this summer. Liam Delap was earmarked as a top target ahead of the window opening on June 1 because of the £30m release clause in his Ipswich Town contract.",
      "As big a risk as it was to try and sign another relatively raw and unproven striker, his release clause meant he was an attainable option. However, Chelsea were more appealing to Delap and he moved to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United continue to be linked with strikers both domestically and abroad, whether they be attached to clubs or free agents, but no concrete bids are understood to have been submitted. It is likely this particular search will go deep into the window.",
      "As far as outgoings are concerned, it is no secret by now Tyrell Malacia, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony have informed the club they want to leave. They are not training with the rest of the squad at Carrington and United are equally keen to offload them.",
      "However, offers have not been forthcoming thus far, meaning United are not understood to be close to saying farewell to any of them. Rashford's and Sancho's wages could be problematic for prospective suitors, particularly in Rashford's case, meaning his most likely exit route could be via a loan deal.",
      "Rashford, who is valued at £40m, wants to move to a club that can offer him Champions League football. Barcelona and Bayern Munich continue to be linked with him.",
      "Real Betis, meanwhile, are continuing to express interest in Antony after his successful loan spell in Seville in the second half of last season, but they are yet to come up with a formal offer. United need to sell him for £32.58m to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR)."

      "Bryan Mbuemo is exactly the sort of player Ruben Amorim wants at Manchester United, according to his former coach. The United manager is looking to make Mbuemo his second major signing of the summer after Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, with negotiations for the Brentford star ongoing.",
      "United know what they are getting in a proven Premier League talent and Mbuemo may see similarities in Amorim to the coach he had back at the beginning of his playing career. Rui Almeida trained him when he was a teenager coming through the youth team at Troyes in France's second division.",
      "The 19-year-old would last only a year there before Brentford snapped him up in the Championship, and Almeida did not need long to see the qualities that would stand Mbuemo out among teammates.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "\"In my opinion, he had two or three things to stand out - his physical capacities but also he thought really fast - before the ball arrived to him he already had two options in his mind. From a young age, we told him that each training had to be like a final and he caught that and got that for his life.",
      "\"He trained like every session was really important. That maybe separated him and took him to another level from other talents that we had at his age.",
      "\"His decision-making in high pressure was really different and we saw that. After that, he was fast and dribbled and his shooting was very good also but at the time we told him, Bryan you always play right winger because he had a great left foot but I told him the challenge if he wanted to improve was to learn to play in the other positions.",
      "\"We put him as a second striker and a a striker and from there he has done so well at Brentford. If Ruben takes him, he will play all the sides of the 3-4-3.\"",
      "Almeida has had a varied coaching career, as may be expected for somebody who began at just 26. A few years in his native Portugal were followed by seven in France before jobs further afield in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and most recently Morocco.",
      "He is six months into life at Difaa El Jadidi, and enjoying life in a country that is only growing interest in football ahead of hosting the 2030 World Cup.",
      "\"I like the experience of the last six months and they invited me to stay,\" he said. \"With the World Cup coming, they are improving a lot of things. The league is very competitive, Morocco came third at the last World Cup even if many of the players are in different leagues like many countries, but recently the level is increasing. This year they will start eight new stadiums in the league so the facilities are improving.\"",
      "Almeida has always kept an eye out for the players he has coached along the way though, and has been thrilled to see how well Mbuemo has done in the Premier League. As United close in on a move, Almeida believes they will be signing a player who can combine well with Cunha as well as do the teamwork that is crucial to Amorim's ethos.",
      "\"Manchester United fans have been waiting for a title again for a long time so there will be pressure, and Bryan will need the team behind him to help him but he will also help the team to do good things. One thing that you always need and I see Bryan doing at Brentford is he is a team player.",
      "\"He's very good individually but he works a lot for the team, he runs a lot for the team and defends a lot for the team so I think he is a player that Ruben likes a lot.",
      "\"I also think he's a good complement for Cunha. Sometimes in teams you need good complement for players. They are different players and teams need that difference in the forwards.\""

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window could be one of the most important in the club's recent history.",
      "Ruben Amorim will take charge of pre-season for the first time as United manager as he prepares for his first full season in charge.",
      "The jury remains out on his position as manager after a difficult start to life in the Old Trafford dugout and after a lot of trust was placed in him ahead of the 2025/26 season, United have to have a strong transfer window.",
      "United have so far sealed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, as well as teenagers Diego Leon and Enzo Kaya-Biyik, but are yet to sell and of their wantaway players.",
      "They have also seen two bids rejected for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they look to agree a deal with the Bees to sign the 25-year-old, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Cunha has been added to the squad, but Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were at Amorim's disposal when he was appointed and they're not part of his plans for the new season.",
      "Antony and Tyrell Malacia were also at Amorim's disposal before leaving on loan to Real Betis and PSV respectively in the January window. Their returns to Carrington have been delayed as they look for new clubs.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and, yet, they have a weaker squad in the third week of July than at the end of last season, which must concern Amorim behind closed doors.",
      "Simply put, United need to get a move on in the summer transfer window because they're close to letting Amorim down.",
      "There has been no breakthrough in negotiations with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo and it's hoped he'll be on the plane to the USA. Another signing would be ideal by then to give Amorim time to work with his new additions, although sales are required to unlock funds for further incomings.",
      "Selling is just as important as buying in the transfer window and serious concerns will be raised if one of the five castaways (Garnacho, Rashford, Sancho, Antony and Malacia) aren't sold soon.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Cunha so early on in the window, United would have hoped to have achieved more by now. Cunha had not officially finalised his move to Old Trafford by the time they submitted their opening offer for Mbeumo, highlighting just how keen they were to get their business done nice and early.",
      "It would have been unrealistic to suggest United could have got everything done by now, especially when sales are so important this summer, but they would have hoped for more than just Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "With the start of the pre-season tour now less than a fortnight away, supporters are within their rights to feel slightly concerned. United finished 15th last term and desperately need to add fresh blood to Amorim's squad.",
      "The longer this current lull persists, the more restless supporters will become. However, if United get a deal over the line for Mbeumo before too long and go on to secure the services of a striker, all should be forgiven.",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha so early in the transfer window was an excellent start to United's summer business but since then everything has gone a bit stale.",
      "The wait for Bryan Mbeumo continues to lumber on and the longer that wait continues the more frustration will grow among supporters.",
      "United need to sell players to buy beyond Mbeumo too and while elite forwards continue to fall off the market, the delay in offloading the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia becomes more damaging.",
      "Something needs to give this week and United need to make progress on a signing or a sale to kickstart their business before Saturday's opening pre-season friendly against Leeds United."

      "Onana had been preparing under the assumption he will still be at United for 2025/2026.",
      "The Cameroon international made an impressive start to last season, but his form plummeted and he made high-profile mistakes against Nottingham Forest, Viktoria Plzen and Lyon.",

In his first season in Manchester, the Turkish shot stopper made just one appearance against Newport County in the FA Cup as Ten Hag was reluctant to swap out the Cameroonian.",
      "Last season, with Onana's form still shaky and Ten Hag removed from power, Bayindir was given a few more opportunities to impress. However, his performances were inconsistent albeit his performance against Arsenal in the FA Cup in January was impressive.",
      "Despite Ruben Amorim being more confident to trust Bayindir, he remained firmly a second choice and now even that position is in doubt. The Mirror reported on Sunday that United are interested in signing another goalkeeper this summer with Botafogo's John thought to be high on their shortlist.",
      "If he was to arrive, Bayindir's position at Old Trafford would start to look even more uncertain. MEN Sport understands Onana has received reassurances from the United backroom staff that he remains part of the plans and Tom Heaton signed a new contract to be third choice.",
      "As such, The Mirror reports that Bayindir's agent Sefa Seyrek has flown to Manchester to discuss his client's position at the club. It is believed that the 27-year-old fended off interest from Europe for his signature in January as he did not want to leave.",
      "In recent weeks, that interest has resurfaced again and Bayindir could, this time, welcome such an approach."

      "Well-versed in a 3-4-2-1 formation from his time at Molineux, Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Amorim's system. He regularly operated in that role at Wolves, meaning he should be able to settle into the groove at Old Trafford relatively comfortably.",
      "Amid the expectation that Cunha will cement himself as United's left-sided playmaker, captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to operate in central midfield permanently this season. The Portuguese international often played as one of the two No.8s in the second half of last term and regularly looked more dangerous.",
      "He enjoyed a real purple patch after initially being tasked with operating deeper, providing both goals and assists. Playing deeper also allows him to scan the game and help dictate proceedings.",
      "With Fernandes expected to become a No.8 on a full-time basis, it means one of the two central midfield spots in Amorim's system is already sealed.",
      "Therefore, Amorim will be hoping to witness some healthy competition throughout pre-season in the race to start the campaign as Fernandes' midfield partner.",
      "United want to sign a midfielder this summer, but they are having to prioritise attacking additions instead. They are still in talks with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo and they are yet to source a striker.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United must prioritise the addition of a No.9 over a new midfielder this summer.",
      "With that in mind, pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season as Fernandes' midfield partner. Manuel Ugarte, who was recruited from Paris Saint-Germain almost a year ago, will believe he is a worthy candidate to start, likewise fellow midfield enforcer Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte joined United last August with the ambition of fixing their midfield problems. His debut season at the club featured a collection of up and down performances, with concerns often being shared about his ability on the ball.",
      "As a midfield enforcer, though, he was able to flex his muscles, offering United a sense of bite and aggression in the engine room. Casemiro, on the other hand, struggled to deal with the intensity of the Premier League, saving his best performances for the Europa League.",
      "The Brazilian could be sold this summer amid the fact his contract is up next summer. The addition of a new midfielder could spell the end of his Old Trafford career.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to make up for lost time this season after a stop-start 2024/25 campaign. He struggled to get into any sort of rhythm last term because of both injuries and being tasked with operating as either a No.8 or a No.10.",
      "In truth, Mainoo joining forces with Fernandes in midfield will leave United short of defensive nous and bite in the engine room. Mainoo is a forward-thinking player, who likes to take the ball on the half turn, glide past his man and get into attacking positions.",
      "The only way in which Fernandes and Mainoo could potentially join forces in the middle is if United were to revert to a three-man midfield and had a defensive specialist alongside them. That, though, is not going to happen under Amorim's watch.",
      "Toby Collyer will also believe he is worthy of an opportunity to impress in pre-season, but he will have his work cut out to try and leapfrog Ugarte, Casemiro and Mainoo in the pecking order.",
      "Nevertheless, he will determined to prove his worth ahead of the competitive action kicking off next month. He has offered glimpses of his capabilities and will not give up on attempting to become a regular starter.",
      "Whatever happens, a healthy level of competition can only be a good thing for Amorim."

The issue from Gyokeres' side, which is currently resulting in the player effectively going on strike, is that he was under the impression he could leave for just under £60m.",
      "Varandas has confirmed that Sporting will be launching disciplinary action against Gyokeres for failing to report for the start of pre-season. Such behaviour may feel uncommon practice, however Sporting do have precedent for dealing with clubs like this and Manchester United have already been told the formula to succeed.",
      "Cast your minds back to the January transfer window of 2023 and Tottenham Hotspur seemed certain to be signing Pedro Porro from Sporting. All was agreed and a medical was booked in London for the full-back.",
      "However, as The Athletic reported at the time, the deal was on the verge of being called off as Varandas made a last-minute ploy for more money by reneging on the offer that was already agreed. This unconventional move is not too far removed from what the Sporting president is doing with Gyokeres.",
      "Eventually, Spurs were able to get their man through help from Porro who admitted he did not turn up to training on deadline day so that he could force Sporting's hand. United will hope the Swedish centre-forward is not having to resort to such tricks come the end of August if they are trying to sign him but the lessons from the Porro deal are a timely reminder for the Reds.",
      "Sooner or later, Sporting are going to have to fold on Gyokeres. They simply cannot afford to have a player in their squad who is willing to not turn up to training until a move away is completed.",
      "It makes no sense for Varandas to keep a player against his will and while, at the moment, he is happy to hold his line due to the lack of competitive fixtures, he will have no choice but to compromise as we edge closer to the regular season beginning. Should United want Gyokeres, they must remain patient and trust that negotiating with Sporting will become easier as the transfer window progresses."

      "“So still no breakthrough in this story as of tonight but Manchester United keep advancing to find the right structure for the deal. They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",

Onana’s camp made it known that he was not actively seeking a move, and that has complicated matters further. Ideally, Amorim would have replaced him, but if not, the plan was always to bring in a goalkeeper to compete with Onana. That remains the case.’",

      "Liverpool’s reluctance to sell Luis Diaz could see Bayern Munich raid Arsenal instead, while West Ham are exploring a deal for a Reds talent…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nReports over the weekend suggested Bayern had made a £45million bid for a player who seems quite keen to move. But Liverpool are either serious when they say he’s not for sale, or they’re intent on driving the hardest of bargains.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "19) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThere has been speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao but the Porto winger’s release clause is about to go up by 50%, so we ought to see some clarity soon if Juve are serious about Sancho. And, perhaps more importantly, how serious Sancho is about Juve and kickstarting his tail-spinning career.",
      "",
      "18) Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United. But reports suggest Milan might be a problem for the Red Devils.",
      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to West Ham\nThe Hammers seem keen to put some of their Kudus cash into luring Elliott away from Liverpool but it is so far unclear what the Reds would accept. The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "13) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there.",
      "11) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who could yet be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. But reports over the weekend suggest the Serie A champions have backed away somewhat, preferring instead a £30million deal for Udinese’s Lorenzo Lucca. It could all be part of the transfer dance if Napoli are looking for a sweeter deal from Liverpool, but this certainly doesn;t appear as advanced as it did last week.",
      "10) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited remain in talks with Brentford and they are, apparently, hopeful of getting a deal done before the end of the week. We’ve heard that once, probably twice, already. United fly off to the United States in a week and Ruben Amorim wants Mbeumo on board.",
      "",
      "9) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "6) Mark Travers – Bournemouth to Everton\nTravers is heading to Merseyside as he prepares to swap the Bournemouth bench for Everton’s new one. Once his medical is wrapped up later today, the Toffees will complete a deal worth £4million plus add-ons. Which we assume won’t be heavily incentivised on playing time.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marco Bizot – Brest to Aston Villa\nThe once-capped Netherlands international keeper is in Birmingham to complete a move to Villa. We assume to serve as Emi Martinez’s understudy but it remains possible the Argentina World Cup winner could be on his way before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nBournemouth have agreed to take another Chelsea keeper, this time permanently, with the 25-year-old moving for £25million. Petrovic will have a medical once Chelsea fly back from the United States.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "2) Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger is at Arsenal today to wrap up a medical and the final details of a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "It’s money month, the time of year when the season sort of starts again with friendlies and fake tournaments, but not really. It’s also a despicable time when the ugliness of top-flight football arrogantly bestrides the world in pursuit of tiny amounts of extra money.",
      "If your side does well, it cheers you for the new campaign; a few poor results and everyone is disgruntled. And it usually proves no guide to what happens in the season.",
      "ITV even showed Preston v Liverpool. It still seemed more significant than the CWC obviously, but I seriously wonder about the fitness of footballers who last played internationals a month ago. We’re familiar with player burn-out as a concept, though it’s usually only used as an excuse for defeat, not a reason for victory. You’ve been playing for the best part of 11 months; you’re not going to lose anything in a month that a friendly against Preston would revive. Surely light training is all that’s needed.",
      "Back in the day, the time off would last from mid-May until mid-August, a time which would be spent drinking and eating gravy dinners, so players would need to run up sand dunes – vomiting as Big Jack shouted profanities – to get fit again, but I doubt that’s the case now that they measure everything all the time and they live off chicken and pasta.",
      "I watched Middlesbrough play and lose to Port Clarence Reserves in the 70s, but clubs have now realised there’s money in pre-season games and pretending they’re competitive. So this Saturday you could watch Gateshead v Sunderland or Matlock v Derby or Dartford v Charlton amongst others. I’m not sure anyone except the most loyal obsessive bothered, but it’s a part of a great tradition. And of course bigger clubs are playing in fake tournaments all across the world so they can earn enough to pay for a reserve full-back from Austria.",
      "But then Premier League clubs are different, moral-free beasts with no conscience. The Guardian reckons the 20 clubs are unconscionably taking a planet-breaking 175,000 summer air miles in just a few weeks, the idiots. Manchester United are flying 24,000 miles to show off their mediocrity and are even playing Leeds in Stockholm. City are spending 15,000 miles in the air and face Palermo in Sicily to contest the inaugural Anglo Palermitan Trophy which commemorates the Sicilian club’s maiden fixture against a team of British sailors in 1900. At least they’re used to wasting energy competing in insignificant tournaments. You’re playing for fans in the country you’re flying to, are you? As they die in the heat or are swept away in floods, I’m sure they’ll appreciate it..",
      "Time was they’d play a relatively near lower-league side to help them earn much-needed money from the gate receipts for games that were much in demand. Games like the one v Preston are rare. You can see Liverpool play Milan in Hong Kong though. Or Newcastle play Arsenal in Singapore. No game against Blyth Spartans in Blyth, then? Nah, that’s just legacy thinking.",
      "Personally I loved the pre-season friendly. Boro went through a phase of playing Hibs thanks to Tony Mowbray’s connections and they were always great pish-ups that Hibs certainly took seriously.",
      "There is a better solution, though it would deny these clubs money to fritter away. Scottish football, which I know most of you don’t care about, and to be fair does have the tradition of terrible decisions by the SFA, got it right for once and has had a much better idea with the Premier Sports Cup. The group stage involves 40 clubs – the 37 SPFL clubs for 2025/26 who are not involved in European competition plus Bonnyrigg Rose (relegated to Lowland League), Brora Rangers (Highland League winners) and Brechin City (Highland League runners-up).",
      "Teams are drawn into eight groups of five based on final league positions in 2024/25 and it fires the starting gun on the new season this weekend. They realised that the League Cup retains some credibility so they set up a league stage, where they get to play actual competitive games instead of friendlies and football-starved fans lap it up in the ‘foreign’ July heat, heading towards a final in December.",
      "It is often the one trophy that the Glasgow big two don’t actually always win, though Celtic are the current holders and it has value because of that alone. The CWC has shown the pointlessness of playing in tournaments no one believes in.",
      "Why doesn’t England swallow its ego and copy Scotland instead of treating it like a poor, pish-stinking old relation? It’d get the competition done earlier, providing an early meaningful start to the season. They’re obviously not opposed to playing in July. However, the gate receipts are probably dwarfed by money gained playing in these fake overseas tournaments. So once again, we see how local, domestic football suffers because of the insatiable lust for money, no matter how small, in a way it once never was.",
      "Pre-season pulls back the curtain and shows the most important thing to top clubs. It’s not football or even fitness. It’s just money. Nothing else. The hateful club execs, desperate to justify their lavish wages, just care about money. 175,000 miles. Climate change doesn’t discriminate in favour of football clubs, y’now. You die too. Good luck paying to offset that. And more to the point, you’re effectively killing and ruining the lives of your own fans. Yeah, that makes good economic, if not moral, sense.",
      "Even that doesn’t stop the stupids or deniers. More money, more money, more money. Stop buying players! We’d rather see a local kid come through. No? They’re all crap? Well, that’s down to you. But you’d rather fry in 33 degrees of heat to get one place higher in the league? Morons. It’s 27 degrees here on the west coast of Scotland, it’s unnatural. And when you get skin cancer you can thank the Premier League for not giving a shit and putting a few quid above the health of the planet and its people. F*cking idiots.",
      "So craven for a little bit more money, they are even prepared to exploit not just the Earth but their own assets to the maximum and then some, even at the risk of breaking those same assets, the way they’re breaking the planet. To a rational mind it makes zero sense and is the economics of the madhouse. Protest this obscene situation because they are willingly blind to it. On the contrary, they think they’re clever.",
      "Further down the pyramid, it’s still as it ever was as your local centre-half takes a break from laying bricks to kick your fancy striker up in the air, but it’d be nice if it actually mattered and since they’re already playing, why not? Keep pre-season local.",
      "Does the environment not matter? Obviously not. What a terrible example to future generations who will have to live with and combat their selfishness, if they live at all.",

      "The Red Devils triggered Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves early in the window and have also completed the signing of Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno for £3.3m, but further transfer business has stalled as they focus all of their attention on landing Mbeumo from Brentford.",

      "Romano said: “I can guarantee to you again this week, Man United, fully focused on Bryan Mbeumo deal with Brentford, with conversations still underway, with Man United’s absolute focus being on Mbeumo, with a player still waiting for Manchester United as a top priority.",
      "“So they keep advancing. They keep working on this deal for Mbeumo. There is still an agreement to reach with Brentford, but I’m told that the conversations are ongoing to try to reach this agreement and let the player travel and complete his move. So Man United keep working on Bryan Mbeumo as absolute priority.”",

      "Very good chance we’re projecting a little bit here, but if there were a theme to this summer’s Premier League transfer business thus far it would be Okay, You’ve Had Your Fun.",
      "Everyone enjoyed themselves, didn’t they, watching unlikely and less familiar teams compete for European spots? And everyone really enjoyed watching Tottenham and Manchester United be astonishing levels of sh*t for astonishing periods of time, right up until Spurs somehow unSpursed themselves at the best/worst possible moment.",
      "But we get the impression now that it’s not just Spurs and United themselves spooked by last season’s ineptitude. Some of the other big clubs might have been hit by the realisation that this could happen to them if the Premier League’s middle-class weren’t brought to heel.",
      "Let’s not pretend that the biggest clubs buying the best players from the other clubs in the league is a brand new phenomenon, but we’re not even at the middle of July yet and the heart has been ripped out of several of the upstarts who made last season so different.",
      "And it’s the big clubs doing that ripping. Four of the traditional Big Six are currently Europe’s four biggest spenders this summer, and all of them have moved to take some of the best players from elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool have Milos Kerkez. Chelsea have Joao Pedro. Tottenham have Mohammed Kudus, even if they have managed to Spurs their pursuit of Morgan Gibbs-White up. Man City have got themselves a Rayat Ait-Nouri.",
      "Arsenal will be very much in the top five once they and Sporting stop their absurd game of chicken and just get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres as we all know they eventually will once everyone can agree a way to proceed that allows everyone to feel like they’ve won. They’ve also got themselves a Christian Norgaard to continue the theme anyway.",
      "Man United sneak into the top 10 as well after signing Wolves lunatic Matheus Cunha, and again the only reason they’re not higher is because Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t yet decided precisely which and how many unimportant disposable meatbags he needs to sack to scrape together enough coppers to get himself a Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Is it too early to officially Fear for Brentford? We really think it might not be. They must have known the day would come that Thomas Frank tried his luck at somewhere bigger and also probably stupider, and he will certainly be doing those things.",
      "One of the most interesting things we thought we might learn next season was just how good Frank is, and that this would involve not just what he did at Spurs but what Brentford did in his absence. How much of Brentford’s success has been down to him personally? How able is he to replicate that in a very, very different environment?",
      "But Brentford appear to be about to take on that challenge in even more extreme circumstances than anyone could have imagined. They approach the dizzying uncertainty of life without their inspirational manager – and several members of his backroom staff – also without Norgaard, who did so much to make them tick, as well as almost certainly Mbeumo and quite possibly Yoane Wissa.",
      "And promoting a manager from within represents an admirable but enormous gamble. The desire for some continuity may be understandable, but when you don’t have continuity of players we do wonder how prudent a move that actually is.",
      "The good news for Brentford is that they are far from alone. Wolves have lost Cunha and Ait-Nouri. Brighton have lost Pedro. Forest are about to lose Anthony Elanga and Gibbs-White. Bournemouth have lost Kerkez and Dean Huijsen – even Real Madrid are helping out their big-club mates – while Palace will surely be stripped of some combination of Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and very likely the Europa League.",
      "West Ham’s situation is slightly different, with the sanctioning of Kudus’ sale even to the worst possible place very likely a pretty smart, hard-headed decision to generate significant funds for their squad rebuild by offloading a player who doesn’t quite fit with the new manager’s plans. But it’s still another chastening reminder of how the land lies.",
      "These clubs have all trod this path before and at least some of them will be absolutely fine and possibly even improve for smartly reinvesting that cash in new, cheaper players who go on to become the next big-money signings for the larger beasts.",
      "Last season’s upsetting of the Premier League applecart came about in large part because the money sloshing around the Premier League is such that even the division’s proletariat now find themselves with spending power to outgun pretty much anyone outside the superclubs anywhere else.",
      "But right now it’s an uncomfortable time for a lot of the Premier League’s middle-class as the old order seeks to re-establish itself at their enormous expense."

      "Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona may never materialise as the Spanish giants have reportedly selected an alternative, Ademola Lookman.",
      "Rashford’s time at Manchester United is realistically over, but both he and the club are struggling to find an exit route.",
      "The 27-year-old spent half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but has made it clear that he favours a move to Barcelona, with the Catalan club looking to strengthen their attacking depth.",
      "Initially, it looked as if Rashford’s move would not come to be with Barceloan going all out to sign Nico Williams, only for the 22-year-old to go sign a ten-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Rashford then would have been hopeful about his chances, but a report from Spain suggests Barcelona are going after an alternative, former Everton winger Lookman.",
      "Sport, a newspaper based in Barcelona, says head coach Hansi Flick ‘likes’ the 27-year-old and that he could be available for less than €50 million.",
      "“The Blaugrana have other options on the table, such as Rafa Leao, and are also reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation of Atalanta star Ademola Lookman,” journalist Lluis Miguelsanz said. “He’s a player Flick likes, but his situation isn’t encouraging because relations with his entourage are currently strained.",
      "“Lookman has been trying for years to make the big leap from Atalanta to a top-flight Champions League club, but so far no one has taken the step to sign him.",
      "“The Italian club took a chance by signing him from Leipzig for €10 million, and he’s exploded onto the scene. He’s been gaining international prominence and is now a more mature player, although he needs to take a definitive step to establish himself at the elite level, as his performance is still very inconsistent.",
      "“He’s a pure winger, fast and capable of scoring goals. And he can play in all attacking positions, something Barça highly valued in Luis Díaz, the leading candidate to fill that position if financially possible. Atalanta would be willing to negotiate his sale for less than €50 million because his contract expires in 2027 and he hasn’t renewed yet, and Tottenham are strongly interested in signing him.”",
      "One stumbling block, though, could be Lookman’s choice of agency and their involvement with an ongoing issue at Barcelona.",
      "“The major handicap is that Lookman shares a representation agency with Marc-André ter Stegen, and problems with the goalkeeper are brewing.",
      "“The German will push hard to stay at Barça, and this could create an awkward situation for all parties, which could significantly impact relations with Lookman’s entourage.

      "This is remarkably BlueCo Chelsea.",
      "Madueke’s modest output last season is then excused because it is ‘important to remember he had Nicolas Jackson on the end of many chances he was creating’.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
