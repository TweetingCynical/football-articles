      "Manchester United's FA Youth Cup winning team of 2022 has produced some incredible talents, including England internationals, FA Cup winners and some who didn't quite make it at the top level",
      "Manchester United's class of '22 went down in club history after they won the FA Youth Cup two years ago – but where are those that lifted the trophy today?",
      "It was back in May 2022 when United's Under-18s were crowned FA Youth Cup champions for a record 11th time by beating Nottingham Forest 3-1 at a sold-out Old Trafford. The Red Devils' victory in the competition was their first since 2011 when the likes of Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Ravel Morrison all featured.While some have gone on to become household names in the Premier League, and even for England, there are several stars who have gone on to pastures new – including a promising young Norwegian and a 600-goal striker. Over 67,000 supporters were there in 2022 to watch the youngsters beat Forest, and many of them will be wondering just what has happened to those who played in that supremely talented young United side.",
      "Mirror Sport has looked into where those youngsters are now.",
      "The 20 year-old Czech goalkeeper joined United in 2020 from Sigma Olomouchas and played in every game in the cup run, making several impressive saves along the way. The shot-stopper was also United’s number one in the 2021/22 UEFA Youth League campaign. He also played for the Under-23s in April’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Vitek spent the second half of the 23/24 season on loan at Accrington Stanley and received a call up to the Czech U20’s back in March.",
      "Arriving at United at the same time as Alvaro Fernandez and Alejandro Garnacho from Barcelona, Jurado has featured in pre-season for Erik Ten Hag. However, the young Spaniard wanted to move back home and so made the switch to Espanyol for the 2023/2024 season.",
      "Bennett was captain on the night United lifted the FA Youth Cup and scored in the game. The young defender signed a professional contract with Ten Hag’s side in July 2023 and spent the first half of the 23/24 season playing for United’s academy in Premier League 2 before joining Stockport on loan in January.",
      "18-year-old Jackson regularly featured for United's Under-18s in 2023/24, as the young Reds won the Under-18 Premier League North title. He earned his first senior call-up when he was named on the substitutes' bench for the FA cup semi-final against Coventry City at Wembley Stadium and represents Scotland Under-17s at international level.",
      "Murray signed a professional contract at United in May 2023. The 19 year-old left back has continued his development in United’s youth ranks this season, being a constant figure in the Premier League 2 for United. The attacking full-back joined from Huddersfield Town at U15 level, played in all of the side’s games in the run to the 2022 FA Youth Cup final and has made the most appearances for that age group this season.",
      "Gore has spent time with the Under-19’s in the UEFA Youth League, the Under-21’s and in September 2023, came off the bench to make his senior debut in the Carabao Cup against Crystal Palace. He then followed that up with his first Premier League appearance, as a substitute in United's 3-2 win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford in December 2023. He was then loaned to Port Vale but only managed one league game in an injury plagued spell.",
      "Mainoo has been one of the major breakout stars from the cup winning team. The young midfielder has racked up a host of Champions league appearances, 24 Premier league games, a goal in the FA cup final, where he helped United lift the cup, and even a call up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024.",
      "Mather scored twice at Old Trafford in the Under-18s’ run to the FA Youth Cup final against Scunthorpe United and Everton. An England youth international at U18 level, Mather made an Under-21s United debut in August 2021 in the EFL Trophy and spent part of the 23/24 season on loan at Rochdale, with 10 appearances and two goals.",
      "Despite being a firm fan favourite, Isak Hansen Aaroen, who signed a professional deal with United in August 2021, made a permanent switch to Germany and joined Werder Bremen in February of this year. The young Norwegian has so far registered three appearances for Bremen and currently represents Norway Under-21s.",
      "A huge revelation Erik Ten Hag’s side, with 36 PL games played this season, six Champions league appearances, as well as one of the best Premier League goals of all time under his belt - that stunning overhead kick against Everton. The 19 year-old Argentinian also scored in the FA Cup final and has made five appearances already for his national side.",
      "The prolific goal-getter scored an incredible 600 goals for United's rivals Manchester City at youth level, before getting a move to his boyhood club where he continued his sensational goalscoring form.",
      "McNeill netted 24 goals in 21 games in his first season with the United's Under-18s and even made his debut for United's first team as a substitute in the UEFA Europa League match against Real Sociedad in September 2022. However, after loans to Newport and Stevenage over the last two seasons, McNeill has now left United to seek opportunities elsewhere, having been released.",
      "Joe Hugill – Hugill has continued his development and featured for Erik ten Hag in pre-season last year. The striker has continued to line up for United’s Under-21’s with seven goals in nine games, before a loan switch to Burton Albion.Sonny Aljofree – The 19 year-old has been an important figure in the youth ranks since the final.Ethan Ennis – The highly rated youngster spent the majority of this season injured, but is now back and eyeing a breakthrough season at United. He scored several goal of the month contenders and was featured on the Guardian's list of best talents in the Premier League.",
      "Omari Forson – The young Englishman was highly rated by United and even made four appearances for the first team. However following the expiration of his contract with United, Forson joined Serie A side Monza on a free transfer in June 2024.",
      "Maxi Oyedele - The 19-year-old midfielder joined the Manchester United Academy aged eight from Burnley, impressing through the youth ranks. In January 2024, Oyedele joined League Two club Forest Green Rovers on loan until the end of the season and featured four times.",
      "Tom Wooster - The goalkeeper joined from Barnsley in 2021 and was named Academy Player of the Season in his last season at his former club and spent the 2021/22 campaign playing semi-regularly for United’s Under-18s. He also spent time on a work experience loan with Bradford City, playing games for the Bantams’ U19s while still training at United. Wooster helped Bradford to become EFL Youth Alliance North East champions.",
      "He was also part of the travelling party for United's final pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao in August 2023.",
      "Logan Pye - Pye left United at the beginning of the 2023 season to join Burnley on a permanent deal.",

      "Marcus Rashford missed out on Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 and must bounce back with Manchester United or it could cost the forward and boss Erik ten Hag",
      "According to one onlooker - quoted in a report a few days ago - not making the England squad for Euro 2024 did not seem to ‘bother’ Marcus Rashford.",
      "And exactly how did the onlooker deduce this? He or she had spotted Rashford relaxing in an expensive restaurant in Cannes.",
      "Ah, right. Come on, Marcus. You should be at home, not daring to crack a smile, eating only bread and drinking water, self-flagellating. How dare you take a holiday on your time off.",
      "Like the rest of us, Rashford is, of course, entitled to a break from work and, hopefully, enjoys his vacation. But if he is watching England’s game against Serbia on Sunday night, not being in Gareth Southgate ’s squad should ‘bother’ him.",
      "If you had said a year ago that the European Championship would take place without a fully fit Rashford, you would have been laughed out of town. Rashford is in the prime of his athletic life and is one of the most exciting footballers of recent Premier League times.",
      "It is still a touch difficult to fully understand how he did not make a 26-strong England squad but that he is not out here is a damning indictment of his contribution to Manchester United ’s cause last season. Had Erik ten Hag not been spared, Rashford would have been culpable.",
      "That Sir Jim Ratcliffe seems to have sounded out other coaches suggests Ten Hag - new contract or not - is a bad start to the season away from being replaced. Rashford can help avert the danger for the Dutchman.",
      "There have been suggestions the relationship between the two is ‘strained’. If it is, it needs to be sorted. And wherever it may be - whether the south of France or the south of Manchester - Rashford, 26, needs to have a rethink. He can brush off nonsense about him not looking bothered on holiday, obviously.",
      "But consistently being told he does not work hard enough in games has to hurt. Being ditched by Southgate after 60 caps and three tournaments has to hurt.",
      "Being made aware that your beloved boyhood club might be open to offers for you must hurt. Being repeatedly reminded about the alarming statistical contrast between the period leading up to signing a new contract and the period after must hurt.",
      "In the 2022-23 season, 35 Premier League appearances brought Rashford 17 goals and five assists. In the 2023-24 season, he scored seven times and had two assists.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "He had more successful take-ons in the 2022-23 campaign than he had in 2023-24 and more key passes. If you are into this sort of thing, in 2022-23, his xG was twice the number it was last season.",
      "Apparently, Rashford has had talks with Ratcliffe’s right-hand man, Sir Dave Brailsford, which is positive. But the most important talks will be with Ten Hag.",
      "Wherever he is on Sunday night, if Rashford does watch England, hopefully he will be bothered. Because Rashford is so brilliant, he should be an important player for his country… and an even more important one for his club.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co have decided that Erik ten Hag will be staying at Manchester United - but the Dutchman still wants a say on important matters in the club's new structure",
      "Erik ten Hag has given assurances to Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he can work with Manchester United ’s new chief executive and technical director - but only as equal partners.",
      "Ten Hag told Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group that he must be allowed to help shape the club’s playing style and transfer policy alongside Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox after being informed last week that his job is safe.",
      "The Dutchman was unimpressed to hear that United had spoken to several potential successors in the weeks since he had guided the Reds to a shock FA Cup Final triumph over Manchester City. But after being told by Ratcliffe that he would not be sacked during a face-to-face meeting in Ibiza, the 54-year-old made it clear that he is not prepared to relinquish control when it comes to identifying potential transfer targets and making decisions on how his team will play.",
      "Ten Hag then described to the Oldham-born billionaire how he worked so successfully with Marc Overmars and Edwin van der Sar at Ajax after building a relationship with the pair that was based on mutual respect and trust. He insisted that he can build similar relationships with Berrada and Wilcox - if they treat him as an equal.",
      "Overmars was the director of football who recruited names like Frankie de Jong, Mohammed Kudus, Andre Onana, Dusan Tadic and Davidson Sanchez during his time as director of football at Ajax. Van der Sar, United’s former Champions League-winning goalkeeper who was employed as chief executive of the Amsterdam club, generated a fortune by selling the likes of De Jong, Sanchez and Matthijs de Ligt for premium fees.",
      "Ten Hag was briefed on every aspect of the club’s transfer policy and was given substantial input into decisions. When he was negotiating with United about taking over at Old Trafford two years ago, he insisted that a clause giving him the final decision on transfers was included in his contract.",
      "Ten Hag recently spoke on Dutch TV about how his relationship with Overmars worked. He said: “Overmars was the one who set out the strategy and vision of Ajax. He was bright, he had cleverness, strategic insight and he knew so much about football at top level.",
      "“He never wrote anything down, not even two lines on a piece of paper. But he made his vision very clear and everything was in place. When he was forced to leave, everything fell to pieces and there was anarchy in the entire organization. For me it is very clear that if you have a guy like that he can be the bonding factor from the top management of a club to the football side of a club.”",
      "United have told Ten Hag that they are ready to offer him a contract extension - but he will not accept any attempt to take out the clause that gives him a say in transfer dealings. Ten Hag blames United’s disappointing eighth-placed Premier League finish last season on a crippling injury list that stripped him of key players.",
      "But he has told INEOS that if they can deliver three top-class signings to address weaknesses in defence, midfield and at centre-forward this summer, the team will have what it takes to challenge for the top four.",

      "Speaking back in 2019 at a time where Mourinho was out of work following his Old Trafford exit, Lindelof branded the Portuguese coach as one of the best in the game and admitted he missed him. He told Aftonbladet: \"[Mourinho] is, after all, one of the world's best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football.",
      "\"He's a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything. I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug. Even if I did not agree, at the time…he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him. He's won everything. When he says something, you listen.\"",
      "Lindelof has made over 250 appearances for Manchester United during the past seven seasons but the Red Devils are likely to consider offers for him and a number of other players this summer in a bid to raise funds.",
      "In terms of incomings, United have already seen a bid worth £43million including add-ons for Branthwaite rejected by Everton, who value the supremely talented 21-year-old at closer to £70million.",
      "United, now led by Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, are expected to return with an improved bid imminently - but they are unwilling to pay over the odds for Branthwaite and have warned Everton that they will have no qualms in walking away from a deal.",

      "Gareth Southgate's England are among the favourites to win Euro 2024, but Manchester United legend Gary Neville is concerned about the strength of their back four",
      "Gary Neville has voiced concerns about England's defence ahead of their Euro 2024 opener against Serbia, claiming the Three Lions cannot win the tournament unless their back four \"play the game of their lives every single time\".",
      "England boss Gareth Southgate has a wealth of attacking and creative options at his disposal, but will need to strike the right balance if his side are to go on and lift the trophy. Southgate has already hinted Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to start in midfield against Serbia, telling ITV : \"Is he ready to start there? We believe so.",
      "\"We think he can offer something we don't have and give the team a different dimension. He's really been diligent in understanding the role.\" In response to Southgate's comments, Neville said he does not expect England to stick with that pairing for the entire tournament due to concerns over the defence.",
      "\"Serbia are going to play deep and we're going to need to find a way to cut them open, so I can see why Trent works in this particular match,\" Neville began. \"As the tournament moves on, I don't think it will remain that way.",
      "\"I think other players will come into the fold. The clamour for this midfield of Rice, Foden and Bellingham... I don't think Gareth is going to give us that because of the defence. What Trent playing there does is allow Kyle Walker to stay back almost as a third centre-back, which he's done for City for a lot of the season.",
      "\"It allows Trent to go in there on that right-hand side and deliver almost like a right-back and then come back into defence. I can see why it works, but I'm not sure it will be the solution as the tournament moves on.\"",
      "Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is expected to start alongside John Stones after Harry Maguire failed to recover from a muscle injury to make the squad, while Kieran Trippier is set to fill in at left-back with Luke Shaw still not fully fit.",
      "\"That is a massive opportunity for Guehi,\" Neville added. \"I think he's an exciting young player, but when you think about winning a tournament you need to be defensively strong to go all the way and that is the massive worry.",
      "\"I'm struggling in my mind to see how we go the whole way with that back four unless they play the game of their lives every single time. I'm struggling to understand how it can happen.\"",

      "The esteemed group, along with host Mark Pougatch, chatted before the match about Spain's merits as genuine contenders at the Euros this summer. Despite boasting the likes of Rodri and Lamine Yamal, the 2008 and 2012 champions aren't considered among the real favourites by the bookmakers.",
      "Neville doesn't rate their chances if they stick with Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella at left-back after he was given the nod in their opening game against Croatia. Cucurella was an expensive purchase for the Blues from Brighton in 2022, costing £60million.",
      "It's something Neville hasn't forgotten as he assessed whether Spain can go all the way in Germany. \"I didn't think he'd play,\" Neville began.",
      "\"He's not been convincing at Chelsea, he's played a few games towards the end of the season. He's aggressive, he's tenacious, he's a busy little full back, that price tag still astounds every body, I think, still to this day.\"",

      "Manchester United will threaten to walk away from a deal for Jarrad Branthwaite after Everton rejected their opening bid worth £43million including add-ons.  United's proposal was worth an initial £35m plus £8m in 'easily-achievable' add-ons. While they are poised to return to the table with an improved offer, they have no intention of matching Everton's sky-high £70m asking price and will inform the Toffees of their willingness to move onto alternative targets if an agreement cannot be struck on what they consider to be realistic terms.  Branthwaite ticks every box for both INEOS and Erik ten Hag but they are refusing to be held to ransom. There is optimism their early, opening bid will at least get Everton talking. It's understood there is already a broad verbal agreement with the player on personal terms.",
      "United are, however, also interested in Jean-Clair Todibo, a long-standing target, Juventus ' Gleison Bremer and Lille's highly-coveted teenage talent Leny Yoro. There is also admiration for Crystal Palace and England star Marc Guehi.",
      "Juventus are currently showing strong interest in Mason Greenwood and that would help United's cause if they decided to pursue Brazil international Bremer, who is valued between £50m and £60m. Real Madrid are currently leading the race for red-hot prospect Yoro as they're his preferred destination of choice, though Liverpool are also at the table for the Frenchman as he approaches the final year of his Lille contract. The 18-year-old was recently at Wembley Stadium to watch Real Madrid lift their 15th Champions League title at the start of the month.  Meanwhile, German sources are adamant Ten Hag is keen on a reunion with his former Ajax captain Matthijs de Ligt, who could leave Bayern Munich for the right price this summer.",
      "Bayern will drive a hard bargain though and United are operating with a tight transfer budget this summer after missing out on Champions League qualification meaning even if there is substance to reported interest, a deal currently looks unlikely. United, of course, have history with De Ligt, who Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted so desperately under the previous regime back in the summer of 2019. Sporting's Goncalo Inacio has also been heavily scouted though his release clause is worth in the region of £50m.  Everton insist they won't be bullied into selling Branthwaite on the cheap despite needing to raise cash before they submit their financial records on June 30. Ideally, they would favour cashing in on Amadou Onana and keeping Branthwaite for at least another season but the Belgian's £50m price tag is failing to entice potential suitors.",
      "Arsenal admire Onana but they're yet to make formal contact with Everton over a potential deal - contrary to reports. He is a player they've tracked heavily and rate but interest has not gone any further than that at this stage and there are believed to be other midfield targets of greater priority than the 22-year-old.",
      "Edu is currently active in the market but business will be steady and strategic this summer as Arsenal feel they're in no rush to conclude deals. They are open to conversations.",

      "Kieran Trippier has detailed the circumstances behind his failed move to Manchester United, revealing that previous interest from the Red Devils \"just fell away\".",
      "The England international, 33, was heavily linked with United towards the end of his two-and-a-half year spell with Atletico Madrid back in the summer of 2021. Ultimately, though, a switch failed to materialise and Trippier remained in Spain for a further six months before Newcastle came calling in the January transfer window, signing the right-back in a £12million deal.",
      "Trippier has gone on to establish himself as one of the Magpies' most influential players over the past 18 months. It is no secret that Trippier, who started his career at Manchester City, is a boyhood Red Devils fan. And speaking on The Overlap, via Sky Bet, he revealed all about the interest from United.",
      "He said: “When I was in Madrid, the season before I left it was a tough year for me for numerous reasons. I just wanted to come back to England, my family was finding it difficult at the time. I could have stayed at Atletico Madrid, I could have signed a new 3-year contract. Simeone in the car park on the day I was leaving didn’t want me to go but it was the right thing at the right time for my family.",
      "“As players you have to be realistic of where you can go. I knew I wasn’t going to sign for Manchester City or Liverpool, I knew I was restricted to certain clubs. [Manchester] United did come [in for me] straight after the Euros and that was very close. I grew up with my family being reds, but it didn’t happen. Everything happens for a reason.”",
      "When Trippier was pressed by Gary Neville about Manchester United's interest, he went on to reveal that he thought the switch, which would have seen him player under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, \"seemed perfect\". He also quashed talk that he joined Newcastle six months later for money, given the switch took place shortly after the Magpies were taken over by a consortium led by the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).",
      "On the interest from United, Trippier explained: “[On the Manchester United deal] It just fell away. Ole was the manager at the time and everything seemed perfect, I was chuffed, it was Manchester United, the biggest club in the world. It didn’t happen and I was back at Madrid. Six months later I was at Newcastle.",
      "“Everyone raised their eyebrows, obviously people were saying he is going for the money, and he is going for this and that. I have made it clear many times that I took less money going to Newcastle than I did [staying] at Madrid. I didn’t have a relegation clause, even at the position we were in, I trusted the manager and that is a key factor to why I came.”",
      "Trippier, who is set to play a prominent role for England at Euro 2024. The right-back turns 34 later this year and he went on to admit that he doesn't know whether or not this summer's tournament in Germany will be his last as an England player.",
      "When he was asked if he had plans to continue playing football for a few years yet, he added: “100 per cent. I go in every single day looking forward to train. It has never once crossed my mind about when I'm going to finish [playing football], of course the international side more so, for sure. You never know [if this will be his last international tournament]. I’m one of those where I'll never come out and officially retire, I'll always be there if I'm needed.”",

On Friday, the Red Devils submitted an opening bid worth a total of £43m for the 21-year-old defender which has been dismissed as a lowball offer.",
      "United's hope is that Goodison Park chiefs will get desperate towards the end of the month and become open to a compromise. Mirror Football understands that Everton want Branthwaite to stay put this summer and only a 'mega offer' would change their stance.",
      "If Onana were to sold, not only would it become more important for Sean Dyche's side to keep Branthwaite from a footballing perspective, but the Belgian's departure has the potential to give Everton the cash they need to sufficiently balance the books. However, Arsenal's pursuit of Onana could be put on hold because of Euro 2024.",
      "Belgium are eyeing a run deep into the knockout stages which notably begin on the final weekend of June. Last month, the 22-year-old revealed that his ambition is to play for 'top club' as he aims to 'present' himself during the tournament.",
      "Your turn! Should Arsenal pay £50million for Amadou Onana? Give us your verdict in the comments section",
      "Speaking to Het Laatste Nieuws, 6ft 3in Onana - whose agent claims rejected the chance to leave Everton during the January transfer window - explained: \"At previous tournaments you have seen that the players who did well make the step up to the top clubs. \"That's something I strive for. I feel like presenting myself to the European top and showing what I have to offer. This European Championship is a stage.\"",
      "Should he sign for Arsenal, Onana would serve as a like-for-like replacement for Gunners star Partey, who's been increasingly linked with a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia. Partey, 31, finished the season partnering Declan Rice as the more defensive midfielder in a double pivot. Arsenal have already decided to let Mohamed Elneny leave on a free transfer when his contract expires, leaving Rice, Jorginho and Albert Sambi Lokonga - who spent last season out on loan at Luton - as the only deep-lying midfielders in Mikel Arteta's squad.",

      "Former Liverpool and Man United star Michael Owen doesn't think that Marcus Rashford will leave Old Trafford insisting he doesn't believe any talk of the forward moving on",
      "Michael Owen says he doesn't believe the 'b*****ks' surrounding the future of Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford underwent a difficult season with United and has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford after failing to make the squad for Euro 2024, with fans and pundits speculating that he could seek to reignite his career at a new club. However, former Red Devil Owen isn't entertaining any of the hearsay and firmly believes Rashford will be lining up at United next season.",
      "‌Owen, speaking to BoyleSports, who will offer early payout on EURO 2024 matches this summer, said: \"Rashford won't go, I'm sure of it, he's Manchester through and through. The whole club is a struggle, but he has it in his locker.\" The ex-Real Madrid goal-scorer conceded that there was a chance Rashford could end up playing his football elsewhere but is not convinced all the elements come together for any club to take a punt on the 26-year-old.\"He might leave but his value is so high, who would pay it?\" Owen said, \"They might be thinking, is his attitude right? Is he in great form? I don't see how it can all come together at the moment.\" Owen even hinted that PSG could take advantage of Rashford's uncertain situation at United and swoop for the striker but admitted he just can't see it happening and preferred to put it down to the rumour mill.",
      "\"There was talk of PSG but I can't see that. Who can afford him? And would Man Utd want him to go, particularly with a new manager?\" Owen said, \"I just don't believe all this b*****ks that goes round all the time at this part of the year, it never happens.\"",
      "Rashford was in and out of the United squad as the club endured its worst English top-flight season in 30 years and as a result of his form, Gareth Southgate handed out the crushing blow of excluding him from his 33-man preliminary squad ahead of the Three Lions' European Championships campaign in Germany. Rashford's future could perhaps be in further doubt after the announcement that United are to keep faith with under-fire manager Erik ten Hag for next season.",
      "However, any doubt of where Rashford, allegiances lie was put to bed after he uploaded a picture of himself in floods of tears after Manchester United won the FA Cup. in May The photo posted on Instagram also included the caption: 'That's what the club means to me'.",
      "Owen addressed the sensational headlines that can plague this time of the football calendar and how constant talk can often come to nothing. Making parallels with Rashford's situation, Owen referenced how the build-up to big tournaments is often soured with negative press that rarely comes true.",
      "Owen said: \"This time of year is hilarious. Two or three months before every World Cup there is this big crisis everyone talks about. When the World Cup was in South America there were these killer mosquitos that were going to kill everyone, then one of the next ones was the stadiums not getting built and so on. Then lo and behold they are brilliant World Cups.\"",
      "\"Football is the same, with about five or six games to go, all the teams doing poorly get numerous articles of big clearouts. They say it every single year and the reality is two players go and you have barely heard of them.\"",

      "All it takes is one bad season for a player's transfer value to significantly decrease, as evidenced by the top 10 biggest price tag decreases over the last year",
      "Manchester United winger Antony is joint-top of a list of players with the greatest transfer value decreases last season.",
      "The 24-year-old endured a difficult 2023/24 campaign, registering only five goal contributions across his 38 appearances in all competitions. He's also got the weight of the £86million fee United paid for him hanging over his head.",
      "They look unlikely to recoup anywhere near that sum if they decide to sell him this summer, with Transfermarkt now estimating him to be worth €25million (£21m). That's a drop of €35m (£29.5m) from July 2023.",
      "And it's only matched by France forward Randal Kolo Muani, who joined PSG from Eintracht Frankfurt in a €90m (£76m) transfer last summer. His proposed market value has fallen from €80m (£67m) to €45m (£38m).",
      "In third place is Neymar, who made a €90m (£76m) move of his own to the Saudi Pro League's Al-Hilal. That was an overpayment compared to the €60m (£50.5m) he was estimated to be worth - which has now halved.",
      "An ACL injury which has ruled the 32-year-old out of action since October will have contributed to that. Wesley Fofana of Chelsea has been sidelined for a whole year with the same problem.",
      "As a result, his valuation has also dropped by €30m (£25m) to €25m (£21m). Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg follows in fifth, seeing his price tag drop by €27m (£23m) from €45m (£38m) to €18m (£15m).",
      "That will be mainly because his contract in north London is approaching its final year. There's a four-way tie in sixth place between Joshua Kimmich, Reece James, Mason Mount and Joao Cancelo, all with €25m (£21m) decreases.",
      "Kimmich has gone from €75m (£63m) to €50m (£42m), as like Hojbjerg his deal with Bayern Munich expires in 2025. James' repeated injury woes, which kept him in the treatment room for much of the season again, mean he's fallen from €65m (£55m) to €40m (£34m).",
      "Mount, who United surprisingly paid £60m to Chelsea for last summer, has dropped from the €60m (£50.5m) mark to €35m (£29.5m) after his own injury-hit season. And Cancelo, who was on loan at Barcelona from Manchester City, saw his halve from €50m (£42m).",
      "Rounding out the top 10 of the greatest decreases is Marco Verratti, who after joining Qatari side Al-Arabi from PSG in September in a €45m (£38m) move has seen his €40m (£34m) estimation also cut in half.",

      "YouTuber IShowSpeed, known for his love of Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United, has faced plenty of controversial moments since becoming an online star and rapper",
      "Internet sensation IShowSpeed has been swarmed by SWAT teams and set off fireworks in his bedroom during his controversial rise to success.",
      "IShowSpeed, real name Darren Jason Watkins Jr, came to wider prominence among football fans due to his obsession with Cristiano Ronaldo. The 19-year-old infamously featured on Sky Sports in November 2022 as he attempted to meet his idol.",
      "Sky Sports deleted traces of IShowSpeed’s segment after historical misogynistic comments emerged but this did not slow his success. Watkins subsequently revealed getting a tattoo of the forward, as well as dedicating a song to the former Manchester United hero.",
      "The United fan boasts a combined 52 million subscribers across YouTube and TikTok, having initially gone viral for his live streams on Twitch. Here is a closer look at the YouTuber’s rise to fame and most controversial moments.",
      "Who is IShowSpeed?",
      "IShowSpeed created his first YouTube channel in 2016 but it was not until 2020 that he began to earn a number of subscribers. Clips of his streams began circulating on TikTok and Speed reached one million subscribers in June 2021, with his audience growing at an astonishing rate.",
      "He moved to Los Angeles with fellow streamer Adin Ross and released his first rap single in 2021. In the last year, Watkins has fought KSI in a charity boxing sparring match. The internet personality also featured at Wrestlemania 40 in April, appearing in a Prime bottle costume during Logan Paul’s match with Kevin Owens and WWE legend Randy Orton.",
      "Fireworks, SWAT team and other controversies",
      "He once marked US Independence Day by setting off a Pikachu firework in his bedroom. Believing it to be a firecracker, Speed was surprised when the Pokemon began firing multiple fireworks and shouted to his mother for help during a live stream. The fire service was called, though Watkins repeated the stunt the following year.",
      "Watkins’ live streams have also seen the YouTuber interrupted by SWAT teams because of hoax calls to law enforcement by trolls. After receiving false information, armed police have twice shown up to Watkins’ address in an attempt to apprehend IShowSpeed.",
      "In August 2023, Speed accidentally flashed his penis to 25k viewers as a result of a jumpscare. The clip went viral on social media but the accidental nature meant that YouTube opted against taking further action.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo obsession",
      "Watkins was already a star before his adoration of Ronaldo became a notable part of his online persona. Having travelled to Old Trafford, Craven Cottage and the Qatar World Cup, it was not until June 2023 that IShowSpeed finally met Ronaldo after a 3-0 win for Portugal over Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
      "A year earlier, Speed had released a song titled, ‘Ronaldo (Sewey)’, as well as a single in honour of the last World Cup, both of which commanded millions of views on YouTube. In January 2023, the influencer revealed a tattoo portrait of Ronaldo on his arm.",
      "Despite his idol leaving United, Watkins has remained a fan of the Red Devils and live-streamed himself at Wembley during their recent FA Cup triumph. He has also made a name for himself in charity football matches, notably whipping referee Mark Clattenburg with his shirt after seeing a goal disallowed for offside and putting in a controversial slide tackle on former AC Milan and Real Madrid star Kaka.",
      "E-dating scandal and misogynistic comments",
      "In December 2021, IShowSpeed participated in a livestream e-dating show. Watkins was the first player to be eliminated after making threatening comments to a female participant, later rejoining the stream to fire further slurs at the contestant. The incident led IShowSpeed to be banned from Twitch for \"sexual coercion or intimidation\". His ban was reportedly revoked last year.",
      "A few months later, a Twitch clip of Watkins resurfaced, telling a female gamer to “Get off the f****** game and do your husband's dishes.\" This led him to be banned from playing Valorant and all other Riot Games titles. IShowSpeed apologised for his comments and claimed that he had received racist comments from other players that day, suggesting that this had contributed towards his behaviour.",

      "Manchester United have lodged their first bid to buy top target Jarrad Branthwaite, although their offer of just £35million up front has been scoffed at by Everton. After agreeing personal terms with the 21-year-old defender, United hope to capitalise on Everton's well-documented financial woes, but a move from rivals Arsenal could dramatically change the landscape and put the Toffees in a much stronger bargaining position.",
      "That's because Arsenal have made contact to sign Branthwaite's team-mate, Amadou Onana, with the Gunners told to pay at least £50m. Should that deal be completed by June 30, that'd likely be enough for Everton to avoid any further sanctions from the Premier League and hold out even longer to try and keep hold of Branthwaite.",

I could have stayed at Atletico Madrid, I could have signed a new 3-year contract.",

      "Now aged 60, McClair looks completely different to the player who scored an impressive 31 goals in his first season with the Red Devils. The Lanarkshire-born star was spotted in 2023 enjoying a pint in a Manchester pub named The Gold Cup.",
      "He sported a large white beard and long grey hair – a far cry from his clean-shaven look and brown locks during his playing days.",

      "In his prime, McClair was one of the top players in both the Scottish and English top flight, scoring a staggering 126 goals in 204 appearances for Celtic. His prolific goal-scoring record continued at United under Sir Alex Ferguson, where he became the first player since George Best in the 1967/68 season to score over 20 league goals.",
      "His successful stint with the club saw him win four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the League Cup.",

      "He finally had the opportunity to represent his country on the big stage at the 1992 European Championships, where he scored in a 3-0 win over the CIS (formerly USSR), following losses to Germany and the Netherlands. He hung up his boots at Motherwell in 1998.",

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho has returned to the club but with Erik ten Hag staying his future seems increasingly uncertain",
      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho will have perhaps been the most eager squad member to discover the outcome of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's season review.",
      "Since the FA Cup final more than two weeks ago, Erik ten Hag's future at the club had been up in the air but that speculation came to a head on Tuesday night as MEN Sport understands Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS concluded the Dutchman should remain in position. After finally making that decision, the focus has now turned to the ripple effects it may cause.",
      "One of the biggest issues which shall need resolving is around the future of Sancho. He infamously had a massive bust-up with Ten Hag last September which led to him being exiled until his loan switch to Borussia Dortmund in January.",
      "That move has now ended and the focus will be on what comes next. We have asked some of our MEN Sport writers to predict what they think is to come for Sancho at United.",
      "United planned to sell Sancho whether Ten Hag stayed or not and regardless of the issue between the two, his performances on the pitch are all the evidence needed to suggest a departure has to happen.",
      "In three years at the club he has never come close to hitting the height expected of him. There remains a sense that Sancho plays within himself more often than not for United. Just watch his thrilling performance for Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Paris St-Germain and then try to recall him ever doing that in the red of United.",
      "Whether it is the pressure that comes with playing for United or just never settling in the environment, Sancho hasn't done enough. Ten Hag staying is the only very final confirmation that he has to go this summer.",
      "Edin Terzic leaving Dortmund isn't ideal - he is the coach who has often got the best out of the winger - but the Bundesliga still are still interested and so are clubs in Italy. If United can get back half the £73m they spent it will be a success.",
      "There is nothing new to say on Sancho - he must be sold this summer. His time at United has been a disaster and it seems fitting he will leave in unsatisfactory circumstances.",
      "For all the talk of Sancho regaining his form on loan with Dortmund, he contributed just three goals and three assists and the narrative around his redemption arc clearly went overboard after his excellent performance against PSG in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "That was the winger's standout display during his loan and he otherwise failed to pull up any trees. United have a poor record of selling players and receiving £40m for Sancho would be excellent.",
      "He's never looked suited to the demands of the Premier League and United must cut their losses and move on. Sancho won't be remembered fondly at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho has two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. Realistically, this summer is the last opportunity to try and claw back some of that £73m they splashed on him in 2021.",
      "It is understood that Ratcliffe would like United to sell him for £40m which seems a reasonable amount considering his age, his performances last season and the tainted image the winger has received over nearly the last year. Another loan move back to Dortmund just to ensure he is not around the place seems pointless and benefits nobody except for Dortmund and Sancho.",
      "With United choosing to stick with Ten Hag, they need to ensure a permanent exit for Sancho in the summer. The money generated will be of huge importance to the club's budgets this summer and the ship has sailed for him to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho and Ten Hag had over three months to clear the air when their falling out began back in September before he joined Dortmund in January.",
      "The winger was frozen out of United's first team after refusing to apologise and I would be very surprised if he backed down now. That means there will be no way back for Sancho at Old Trafford. Some may suggest that his performances during a brief loan spell at Dortmund mean Ten Hag should concede to allow a clearly talented player back in his squad.",
      "However, the Dutchman is made of stern stuff and it should be noted that Sancho has never shone consistently in a United shirt. The reality appears to be that the 24-year-old and United do not fit so the Red Devils must hope they get a decent fee for him this summer to end a turbulent spell.",
      "Sancho's race at United felt like it had been run whether Ten Hag remained or not. He is evidently happier elsewhere and sometimes there is just too much water under the bridge to go back.",
      "United were happy to welcome offers, Sancho wasn't going to decline the chance to make a new start elsewhere, and who can blame either party? Now it will simply be about ensuring that whatever happens next is dealt with properly and in an orderly fashion.",
      "Sancho and United drawing out a protracted transfer saga does nothing for anyone. Ten Hag will not be keen to deal with the player over the summer or on pre-season, whilst Sancho himself would be better placed with having as long as possible to get used to a new club.",
      "Swallowing pride and accepting an offer for much less than United spent will be central to this. They won't want to be mugged off, but ultimately it was not Ineos that sanctioned the deal in the first place and that may well make it easier to cut their ties.",
      "Is there a way back for Jadon Sancho at Manchester United after news of Erik ten Hag remaining at the club?",
      "It certainly seemed a Ten Hag exit would have represented the winger's best chance of reviving his Old Trafford career and now that hasn't played out, what comes next?",
      "An apology to the United boss is likely to be first on the agenda for Sancho after his public fallout with the ex-Ajax coach at the start of the season. If the pair are unable to resolve their differences, there will only be one winner in that scenario: Ten Hag.",
      "The last thing Ten Hag requires, after being backed by the board, are questions over whether members of his squad lack respect for him. After already once being undermined by Sancho, it seems unlikely the United manager will want to risk a similar situation playing out after winning over supporters.",
      "A sale, therefore, appears to be the best solution for all parties. Whether Borussia Dortmund can afford a permanent transfer is a concern, though other interested parties will surely come to the table.",
      "United need transfer funds, and Sancho needs a fresh start - and if that was going to be at Old Trafford, then Sancho would have certainly needed a new manager to do so. With Ten Hag now staying on, INEOS have once again backed the manager over the player. The only question United need to answer now is: who can afford Sancho? A £40m asking price seems reasonable following his resurgence at Dortmund, though the Reds will still have to take a hefty loss on their initial £73m outlay.",
      "Another issue is Sancho's wages, with few teams outside the Premier League able to match his exorbitant salary; United may have to supplement those in part, even if he leaves permanently. While Dortmund and Sancho would love another reunion for the 2024/25 season, they surely won't get away with another loan as United need cash for their own targets. Expect a sale - and if it means United can land a signing like Jarrad Branthwaite or Joao Neves, it will still represent a decent deal given their troubles in getting rid of unwanted players in recent years.",
      "With Erik ten Hag now staying at Manchester United, it would make total sense for the club to cash in and sell Jadon Sancho, even if they are going to make a staggering loss.",
      "It has been reported that United want £40m for the 24-year-old, and that figure could even be lowered after it was confirmed Ten Hag is staying, meaning Sancho is more likely to leave. That is a complete far cry from the £73m they paid Borussia Dortmund three years ago, but United need to get anything they can at this stage.",
      "Unless the situation between Ten Hag and Sancho can be resolved, the England international is unlikely to play again for United whilst the Dutchman is in situe. Selling him this summer would not only get Sancho off the books but give the Red Devils more money to spend in the transfer window.",
      "That sum would give them a boost in a potential pursuit of signing a new centre forward, which they desperately need. Although it could be tough to find someone willing to pay the wanted sum for Sancho, United need to try their best to secure him a permanent move away from Old Trafford, rather than a loan due to his contractual situation. He is under contract until 2016.",

      "Erik ten Hag will remain in charge of Man Utd next season and now needs to make his signings work and deliver a successful campaign.",
      "As Ineos weighed up the future of Erik ten Hag during their end-of-season review at Manchester United they considered several factors. There were positives for Ten Hag and there was mitigation, reasons for a desperate Premier League campaign that can be rectified next season.",
      "Those focused primarily on injury issues, but also a sense that the business done in the 2023 summer transfer window was with an eye on long-term results. There was an acceptance that Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund took time to settle and that Mason Mount's season was wrecked through injury.",
      "Ineos expect that there is more to come from the £163m trio and that the full benefit of that investment is yet to be felt. Onana certainly improved as the campaign went on and Hojlund had a couple of spells where it looked like he was ready to lead the line.",
      "The greatest disappointment will be reserved for Mount, who started the season slowly after his £55m move from Chelsea, lost his place in the team and then struggled with his fitness. If there are reasons for Onana and Hojlund to take time to settle into a new league and a new country, it was expected that the England international would hit the ground running in midfield.",
      "Instead, he managed just 20 appearances and eight starts for the club, contributing a solitary goal and assist. His only start after November 1 came in the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace towards the end of the season and he only came on in the 89th minute in the FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "The midfield didn't exactly thrive without him, but that was down to structural issues as much as personnel. The role he was signed for has now been filled by Kobbie Mainoo, a definite positive for Ten Hag, and Mount has a challenge to get back into the team.",
      "Mainoo has become an updrobbale presence in the centre of the pitch and Bruno Fernandes is a guaranteed starter. A new holding midfielder is likely to arrive this summer. That means Mount's role for now is likely to be off the bench.",
      "There is no way Ineos will give up on a £55m signing however and if he does flop again for a second successive season then it will reflect poorly on Ten Hag's judgement. The manager pushed hard to sign him having followed him since a loan spell in the Eredivisie seven years ago.",
      "In a way, Mount has become a key figure during the end-of-season review. When Sir Jim Ratcliffe met Thomas Tuchel the former Chelsea boss pointed to the success he had in getting the best out of Mount at Stamford Bridge and said he could repeat that trick at Old Trafford. Mount played the best football of his career under Tuchel and created the winning goal in the 2021 Champions League final.",
      "The promise of extracting more from a key signing wasn't enough to land Tuchel the job, but the mention of Mount as a factor in the mitigation for last season's performance levels still feels telling. It is now on Ten Hag to get the most out of the 25-year-old.",
      "As a player still yet to reach his theoretical prime and an England international signed for big money, there is pressure on Mount to deliver value. Ten Hag signed him to knit his midfield together and although his first season ended up as a write-off, it's clear there is now a demand to make this deal a success in season two.",

      "Man United are going to make signing a new striker one of their leading objectives in this summer's transfer window.",
      "In recent seasons, few have mastered the art of scoring goals better than Lille striker Jonathan David.",
      "After joining the French club from Belgian side Gent in August 2020, he has plundered 84 goals in 183 appearances across all competitions. On reflection, the €30million they splashed out on him was a snip.",
      "After scoring 13 and 19 goals in each of his first two seasons at Lille respectively, the Canadian international has got close to smashing his way through the 30-goal barrier in each of the last two campaigns, plundering 26 apiece in 2022/23 and 2023/24. His consistently strong output means he is on the verge of breaking into the category of elite strikers alongside some of Europe's biggest names.",
      "And with just one year left on his contract, it is hardly surprising that some of Europe's biggest clubs are being linked with his signature. In midweek, reports elsewhere claimed David had made his way onto a 'three-man striker shortlist' that Manchester United have drawn up for this summer's transfer window.",
      "Following confirmation that Anthony Martial will leave the club when his contract expires on June 30, United's centre-forward options will consist of Rasmus Hojlund and him only. The Dane, 21, is crying out for some support and competition at the tip of United's attack.",
      "United have identified the attack as one of the areas they must strengthen as a leading priority this summer. As a result of Martial's brittleness, manager Erik ten Hag has been forced to insert a square peg in a round hole when Hojlund has been unavailable.",
      "It is no secret that United are going to have box clever with their recruitment drive this summer, remaining mindful of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules [PSR]. The club needs to raise as much money as possible via player sales.",
      "At the same time, however, they have got to improve the squad and bringing in a striker will be key to that mission. In David, should United decide to pursue a move for him, they would inherit a forward who knows where the net is.",
      "The 24-year-old has reached double figures in each of the last six seasons. His hauls of 26 goals in each of the last two campaigns represent the highest returns of his career thus far.",
      "Many might argue that Ligue 1 and the Belgian top flight are not as challenging as the Premier League, but he boasts a better record than Hojlund did prior to his move to Old Trafford almost 12 months ago and the latter enjoyed a respectable first season in England, scoring 16 times. As a caveat, however, it must be acknowledged that David is three years older.",
      "Establishing himself as a prolific source of goals for Lille since his move to France four years ago, David has cemented himself as their poster boy. That means they will be doing everything within their powers to keep hold of him this summer and tie him down to a new contract.",
      "However, now that he is about to enter the final 12 months of his current deal, it means Lille chiefs will become conscious of the fact he could walk away for free in a year's time. That means should no progress be made over a new deal, they may be prepared to cash-in this summer for a cut-price fee.",
      "As per Transfermarkt, David's current market value stands at €50million (£42.2m at current exchange rate), meaning that already represents a respectable price for a player who has scored 52 goals over the last two seasons. Taking his contractual situation into account, that could drop by another £10m or so.",
      "If Lille are worried about losing David for free in a year's time, a fee around the £30m-mark could be very enticing for a lot of clubs this summer. In this current climate, a fee around that mark would represent value for money when you analyse David's record, his age and his profile as a player.",
      "Quick, an excellent finisher and also a creator, highlighted by his return of nine assists in 2023/24, he ticks a variety of boxes. David, too, is also a mobile operator, capable of running with the ball and stretching opposition defences.",
      "Our team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new free WhatsApp community.

      "As with any other player United may take a liking to this summer, the price will dictate whether David is a goer for them or not. United will also have to consider the pecking order in attack after signing Hojlund to be their main striker a year ago.",
      "However, healthy competition is what they need and David would be capable of providing it. If Lille are prepared to entertain the possibility of a sale, he is one to keep an eye on.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's rise to prominence with Manchester United has been incredible",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may only have played 33 games for Manchester United, but he's now on the verge of appearing for England in an international tournament.",
      "The Stockport-born star has had a meteoric rise. His Premier League debut didn't come until the end of November, but he's since grasped the opportunity with both hands. He finished the season as one of the undroppables in Erik ten Hag's side and capped it off with a stunning performance in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "That man of the match display, and what turned out to be the winning goal, sealed his place on the plane to Germany, though in truth it had barely been in doubt since his stellar debut in the March friendly against Belgium. Gareth Southgate is a big fan of the midfielder and has fast-tracked him into the senior England set-up.",
      "The Three Lions start their Euro 2024 campaign on Sunday night against Serbia and there appears to be one spot up for grabs alongside Declan Rice in the centre of midfield. Mainoo had the chance to stake his claim in the warm-up match against Iceland, but like the rest of the England team that night he fluffed his lines as Southgate's men crashed to a 1-0 defeat at Wembley.",
      "The 19-year-old is competing with the likes of Conor Gallagher, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Adam Wharton for a spot in the starting XI, but former Man United and England midfielder Paul Ince believes the youngster isn't ready yet for the step up.",
      "“I think Kobbie Mainoo has done really well this season in a struggling Manchester United team, it’s all happened so quickly and I think he has an experienced head for such a young player,\" Ince said.",
      "“He doesn't seem to be fazed by anything so his inclusion in the squad makes sense to me, but when you look at the situation in terms of England’s defensive midfield players, does he start?",
      "“It depends how Gareth Southgate wants to go. Does he want to go with two sitting midfield players and then an eight in front of him? Or could he go with Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice and Phil Foden in front? That looks more of an answer to me. \"",
      "Ince, who was part of the 1996 England team that reached the semi-finals of the Euros, is a big fan of Mainoo but says Southgate - and United - must be patient with the player.",
      "“Is Mainoo ready now? Of course he's not, he's still so young,\" he told bet365. \"But sometimes you get thrown into the deep end and you just have to swim. You have to survive and I think he can survive.",
      "“But listen, we shouldn't put too much pressure on him because he's only young, he's going to make mistakes. The Iceland game wasn't great, he made mistakes, so when it comes to starting him I think it's a difficult one.",
      "“It depends how attacking Southgate wants to play against Serbia. The most important thing when you play the first game is not to get beat. So whether Mainoo starts, we’ll have to wait and see.”",

      "A new transfer policy is already being implemented by Omar Berrada weeks before he officially arrives at Man Utd.",
      "Manchester United have already begun their overhaul of the playing squad at Old Trafford. Not only with a recruitment drive that is picking up pace, but through moving tackling a monster wage bill.",
      "Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial will be off the salary run in 15 days' time. The high-earners weren't offered new deals and have departed on free transfers, freeing up £30million in annual wages.",
      "They won't be the last exits. The remaining highest-earner, Casemiro, is shuffling towards the exit door, with United believed to be keen on getting him a move to Saudi Arabia, while Christian Eriksen and Aaron Wan-Bissaka could easily be sold this summer. Another senior defender like Harry Maguire or Victor Lindelof could also depart, while uber-flop Donny van de Beek should be shifted for good.",
      "According to Spotrac, they are among the highest earners at the club and could cut as much as a further £53million off the annual wage bill, though it must be said that those figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the very nature of the speculation. Even to be close, however, it could represent an overall reduction of £83million.",
      "It certainly offers plenty of food for thought, particularly for Omar Berrada, United's new chief executive, who will be tasked with ensuring the correct structure is implemented across all areas of the club once he officially joins the club on July 13 after his gardening leave at Manchester City is finished.",
      "Berrada's job will not be to tell the club how to spend their money or which players to target, but he will be in charge of enforcing their negotiating power and ensuring that United do not overpay for players.",
      "It will likely be up to him to evaluate the value of a prospective new signing and ensure that United stick to their principles and are not taken advantage of by overpaying for individuals.",
      "Speaking ahead of taking the Old Trafford role, he warned why overpaying clubs, players, and agents in the transfer market can lead to teams finding themselves on a \"slippery slope\". United have been sliding for a decade.",
      "While United will certainly be looking to initially cut their wage bill this summer, it does not mean that they will be cautious to spend it as a result. Berrada is happy to sanction big deals if they represent value for money; just look at his time with City.",
      "Last season, City became the first club in British football history to spend more than £400million on annual wages, in part due to the mammoth £45million annual salary of Erling Haaland. United's was £91.8 million lower, but that does not mean that they had spent it well.",
      "\"If you have a very solid rationale as to why you're offering the fee, the salary and the commission, they might not agree with it but they will accept it,\" Berrada told the Financial Times at the start of the year.",
      "\"Once you start overpaying then you lose that argument and that puts you in a much more difficult position to say to the next one, 'I can only offer you this.'\".",
      "Those comments perhaps back up United's opening bid for Jarrad Branthwaite. The £35million offer for a player valued by Everton at more than double that has been described by some as 'derisory' but the Ineos regime under Sir Jim Ratcliffe are determined not to overspend.",
      "United have long been accused of spending recklessly in the transfer market and operating without a long-term plan in mind. They will quickly fluctuate between different targets and end up paying far more money than a player is worth. A 'United tax' is something they have to contend with, but Berrada has already had to operate with a 'City tax' working against him as well.",
      "A key part of his success at the Etihad Stadium was the work done by Txiki Begiristain, who would oversee the football side of things, before Berrada's business brain was engaged.",
      "For him to have half as much success on the red half of Manchester, another leading sporting director will be required, and that is exactly what United are trying to do with their pursuit of Dan Ashworth.",
      "As well as the record wage bill for the triumphant 2022–23 season, Berrada also helped deliver annual revenues of £712 million, more than United's, which stood at £648 million.",
      "He believes the on-field success of Pep Guardiola's side was a key reason behind that, but the two are deeply interlinked, given that the success was built upon their successful sporting structure and recruitment policy.",
      "\"The commercial growth of the clubs is predicated or underpinned by success on the pitch,\" he explained. \"If you have a really good business strategy alongside it, then it just turbocharges the growth off the pitch.\"",
      "Berrada will only be a success as part of a wider structural overhaul, and that structural change will only be a success if he is given the power to do his job.",
      "He won't tell them how to spend their money, but he could give them an immediate £83million boost to help.",

      "Man United's hopes of signing Jarrad Branthwaite could be dealt a huge blow if Premier League rivals Arsenal move fast",
      "Manchester United can now prepare for a busy summer transfer window after finally deciding to stick with Erik ten Hag,",
      "The Red Devils have a number of areas to improve before the 2024/25 season with a new centre-back, central midfielder and striker all set to be on the cards. However, PSR limitations could prevent them from adding Ten Hag's priority targets.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite and Joao Neves are two names strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford, but many others are likely to be on the club's radar.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest Man United news and gossip that has been doing the rounds.",
      "United could look to turn to the wonderkid transfer market this summer with reports claiming they are monitoring Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid Oghenetejiri Adejenughure.",
      "According to The Express, the 17-year-old is wanted by United, Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund. He has impressed in Austria with 16 goals in 20 games at Under-18 level with a further four in the Under-17 European Championships.",
      "Adejenughure, like Erling Haaland, has caught the eye while at Salzburg and United are said to be monitoring his progress. Ex-United boss Ralf Rangnick, who currently manages Austria, has 'already earmarked' him as a potential candidate for a senior call-up.",
      "MEN Sport's Josh Holland says: United haven't invested in the market of youngsters properly for some time. Many would argue that their priority should be on improving Ten Hag's current squad but the signing of an unknown prodigy should be on the club's list and Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said his team should be looking for the next Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Preparing for the future is the right way to go, long-term, and there's evidence that forwards from Salzburg can grow into their potential. Should Adejenughure move to Old Trafford, he will need time to grow and be integrated into the first-team set-up at a gradual pace.",
      "Arsenal's pursuit of Everton's Amadou Onana could hinder United's hopes of signing Jarrad Branthwaite. The Gunners have been following Onana since last summer and were said to be interested in bringing him to the Emirates Stadium in January.",
      "According to our sister title Liverpool Echo, the Gunners have enquired about the Belgium international this summer. Should Onana move to Mikel Arteta's side, it could deal United a significant blow in their hopes of signing Branthwaite.",
      "Writing on X, formerly Twitter, the Echo's Joe Thomas said: \"Arsenal interest in Onana has potential to be significant blow to Man Utd's pursuit of Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "“A sale before end of June would be helpful to Everton's PSR position. If that was to be Onana, it would help Everton to, at the least, fight to gain true value for the CB.”",
      "MEN Sport's Josh Holland says: This would be a huge blow for United. Arsenal are desperate for a new midfielder and if their spending last summer is anything to go by, they are expected to spend big this year.",
      "Should Ten Hag miss out on Branthwaite because one of their league rivals managed to get a deal over the line first, it would be another missed chance. Everton aren't short of potential suitors for their prized-assets but their PSR problems does mean they will welcome any deal before June 30.",
      "United are already facing difficulty to get Branthwaite due to the Toffees' high asking price. The fear of seeing that fee rise should Onana go to Arsenal would be a disaster and alternatives would have to be targeted.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS will be eager to see how players perform at the European Championships ahead of making moves for them but there are four players who should probably be avoided. First on that list is Brentford striker Ivan Toney.",
      "It is clear the England striker is eager to make a move to a top club in the Premier League and in truth this transfer window is likely to be his last chance to do that. At 28, his shelf life at the bigger clubs is trickling out.",
      "The Bees reportedly want £60m to allow Toney to move and that is simply too much for a player that still has question marks over his ability. Another forward to avoid is the Netherlands striker Joshua Zirkzee at Bologna.",
      "He will be heading to the European Championships and while he is younger than Toney, his goalscoring record is still questionable. Just 12 goals in 37 appearances leaves a lot to be desired and it is unclear whether he would be able to blossom in the Premier League.",
      "It is not just the striker position United will want to strengthen, defence will also be a priority. On Thursday, reports suggested Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt is being monitored by the Reds ahead of a summer move.",
      "This transfer will depend on whether he could be brought in for the right price. Erik ten Hag clearly rates the Dutchman but there will be those who doubt if he can have the impact in the Premier League.",
      "Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite arguably offers more and with Eric Dier having kept De Ligt out of the side this season, would he offer more than Lisandro Martinez or Harry Maguire? Rounding off the Dutch trio linked with United is Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Now on the surface the 23-year-old looks like he would be a solid addition to the squad. He has had a brilliant season in Germany and is tipped to excel with the Netherlands.",
      "But if Aaron Wan-Bissaka stays, United would have an abundance of right-backs at the club. There is also the fact that Diogo Dalot deserves to keep his place in the starting line-up and Frimpong would not settle for being a backup option.",
      "Even if Wan-Bissaka leaves, Frimpong would be an expensive second-choice and that money could be spent better elsewhere.",

Standing at the back of one of the compact stands in the stylish mini-stadium was Ralf Rangnick, a former manager of one of the clubs and - little did we know then - a future target for the other.",
      "Rangnick was accompanied by his partner and his former United assistant coach and analyst Ewan Sharp. He chatted to Sharp for most of the game and spoke to friends and acquaintances. Sitting on the front row of the same stand, no more than 30 yards away, was United's football director John Murtough.",

The German had a reputation as a shrewd executive as well as a modern coach and the plan was for him to stay on as a consultant for two years once his spell in the dugout had ended.",

A little over 12 hours later his players were aware of what had been said by the time they got to the Emirates and they didn't take it well.",
      "Erik ten Hag had been confirmed as the club's manager for the following season by that point. When Rangnick oversaw his final game on Sunday, May 21, Ten Hag was in the stands at Selhurst Park. The following day he was unveiled at Old Trafford and was evasive over whether he had even spoken to Rangnick when quizzed on the subject during his press conference. When the subject of his planned consultancy role was raised, the Dutchman was dismissive.",
      "As an idea, it was now dead. A couple of days later came official confirmation that Rangnick was the new manager of Austria and that he would no longer act as a consultant for United.",
      "The 65-year-old hasn't been seen back at Old Trafford since, but after watching the Youth League fixture in September he made the short journey to the Allianz Arena to watch the Champions League clash. He had said earlier that afternoon that he still followed the club's progress and had watched them lose to Brighton 3-1 earlier that week.",
      "Many of the problems he had identified were rearing their head again under Ten Hag but chatting to a couple of reporters who had travelled from Manchester, Rangnick resisted the chance to gloat or issue any 'I told you' reminders.",
      "He had recently spoken to Victor Lindelof after a Euro 2024 qualifying fixture between Sweden and Austria in Stockholm and Marcel Sabitzer, a key cog in Rangnick's Austria team, spent the second half of last season on loan at Old Trafford.",
      "It had all started promisingly for Rangnick. A 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on December 5 was noticeable for a first half of aggressive pressing until the team tired. The first five games saw the former RB Leipzig boss avoid defeat but then the wheels fell off.",
      "His record of 11 wins from 29 games ranks him as the worst United manager by win percentage for 50 years. A 4-1 defeat at Manchester City and 4-0 losses to Liverpool and Brighton were low points. Rangnick slammed the Anfield defeat as \"embarrassing, maybe even humiliating\". He also said as many as 10 new players might need to be signed in the summer rebuild, which was a key moment in those behind the scenes joining the players in losing faith and patience.",
      "But fast forward two years and Rangnick is in a very different position. His spell at Old Trafford could have shredded his reputation, but it increasingly feels like a managerial spell at Manchester United can be glossed over on a CV. This has become a club that eats its bosses alive.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has touched on that previously and when the failure of big-name managers is discussed it's often Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho that people think of. Rangnick could be up there though. He has a reputation as a tactically smart coach and a clever football director, but at United he looked out of his depth.",
      "That isn't a view he would subscribe to and speaking to SPORT1 he reflected on the challenges he faced at Old Trafford.",
      "“Of course, it wasn’t an easy time,\" Rangnick said. \"The time to get there back then, there could have been cheaper ones. Obviously, the club has recognised the signs of the times.",
      "\"Many of the things that we discussed internally back then have now been implemented. They brought in a lot of new players. Other players who, for various reasons, were not able to perform at their best back then are now in top form again when they are fit.\"",
      "One of Rangnick's complaints was a lack of support in the January window while he was at United. While he pushed to sign a forward and later namechecked options such as Julian Alvarez, Dusan Vlahovic and Luis Diaz, he later offered up a longer list of names of players he wanted to sign.",
      "\"It was clear to everyone that there was a need in many areas,\" Rangnick told Bild. \"That's why we were already discussing players like Josko Gvardiol and Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig. Those were names that were realistic.",
      "\"We also talked about Alvaro Morata, Luis Diaz, Dusan Vlahovic and, as I said, Erling Haaland when they were still on the market. But the club decided at that time to rebuild the team under the new coach.\"",
      "His spell in Austria has been redemptive, however. So well has he done that Bayern Munich came calling as they sought to replace Thomas Tuchel, only for Rangnick to turn the approach down. He heads into Euro 2024 with Austria having been handed a difficult group, but with the side considered dark horses by many for a deep run into the tournament.",
      "Austria's 4-2-2-2 shape is Rangnick's calling card and a system he struggled to implement at Old Trafford. He has won 14 of his 23 games in charge, with just five defeats, and Austria came second in a tricky qualifying group, finishing a point behind Belgium and easily getting the better of Sweden, beating them home and away.",
      "They face France, Holland and Poland in Group D in Germany and Rangnick has been dealt some injury blows. He is without goalkeeper Alexander Schlager and, maybe more importantly, his best player in David Alaba and key midfielder Xaver Schlager.",
      "But they are one of the few international sides with a truly distinctive style and the presence of so many players who have been associated with the Red Bull network clubs and a tactical style that Rangnick developed is a help.",
      "The coach is certainly convinced they can challenge at this tournament and that they aren't simply in Germany to make up the numbers.",
      "\"If we're complete, then we're a team that is very hard to beat. We're able to compete with anyone at a high level,\" said Rangnick.",
      "\"We saw that during last year's friendlies against Germany and Italy, but also during the Euro qualifiers against Sweden. Even against Belgium we were about to turn the result in our favour in the second game.",
      "\"We're not going to the European Championship just to participate. We want to show what we can do. We are aware that our group is not easy at all. On the other hand, we have faith in ourselves and believe we can qualify for the next round.\"",
      "If they achieve that it will be another step on the road to redemption for Rangnick.",

      "The money Sir Jim Ratcliffe put aside to be invested in Man Utd is already being put to good use and will make a difference in the transfer market too.",
      "Training grounds matter to players. At Manchester United there might be a significant focus on the future of Old Trafford, but for the current squad and potential signings, the £50m investment in Carrington will be of greater value.",
      "Even with Old Trafford requiring modernisation, there remains an attraction to play there. When the players walk out at 3pm on a Saturday they don't see the outdated facilities and the fading paintwork, but a stadium with a story to tell, one of the most famous venues in the game.",
      "When they turn up at training, however, they do notice that things aren't quite right. It didn't take Cristiano Ronaldo long to point that out when he returned to the club for his second spell.",
      "This is where they spend the vast majority of their working week. It is where they train, where they eat and where they prepare. Players will notice if it's not being kept up to a high standard and new signings will notice if it isn't as impressive as other training grounds.",
      "When you're trying to convince a player to sign for your club this stuff matters. A comfortable, spacious, state-of-the-art workplace is an attractive asset to show off and it really can make a difference. When a player is spending so much time there they want it to be amongst the very best, especially at a club that aspires to be the very best.",
      "That hasn't been the case for a long time at Carrington. Much like Old Trafford, a lack of care and attention has allowed it to be overtaken by clubs who have either spruced up their existing training grounds or moved to new locations. Players no longer consider it amongst the best in the Premier League.",
      "For evidence of that you only need to read Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on announcing the £50m investment into the facility, with work starting on Monday and set to last the entire season.",
      "“We want to create a world-class environment for our teams to win,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington training facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers. This project will ensure Manchester United’s training ground is once more renovated to the highest standards.\"",
      "The fact players at the club are raising the state of Carrington as an issue with Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford shows how much this matters to them. They won't have been saying the same things about Old Trafford, which isn't to say that the stadium doesn't need significant work, as Ineos have already stated.",
      "But for the players, this is a priority, while it is also cheaper and easier to deliver on than either improving Old Trafford or building a new stadium, with the money the first tranche of the $300m Ratcliffe invested for infrastructure improvements on sealing his minority investment into the club.",
      "The £50m will also pay United back. Not only does it improve the working environment for players but it makes the club a more attractive proposition to potential signings. Playing for United is a good selling point, but it's not the deal sealer it was a decade ago.",
      "Instead, players will want to know that the conditions are in place to deliver success and make up ground on Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Ineos are getting a lot of things right and this statement is another example of that.",
      "This summer they will only have plans to show prospective new signings, but it shows that they are taking action. That alone is encouraging for players to hear.",

And while he finished the season on a high, in the squad that lifted the FA Cup, he had started just three games out of the last 17 for United.",
      "It has led to some critics - particularly former Everton and Real Madrid midfielder Thomas Gravesen - questioning Eriksen’s place in the Denmark squad given his lack of minutes at club level. Gravesen has been vocal in his opinion about the midfielder in recent times, and repeated his view this week with Denmark on the verge of their first game against Slovenia.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been heavily linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer, but ex-forward Michael Owen has no doubt he will stay at Old Trafford",
      "Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford's future at the club has triggered a swirl of rumours that Michael Owen has dismissed as \"b*****ks\".",
      "Despite a challenging season for Rashford and his absence from the squad for Euro 2024, which gave rise to speculation about a potential move, Owen is confident that he will remain with United. In an interview with BoyleSports, who are offering early payouts on EURO 2024 games this summer, the former striker said: \"Rashford won't go, I'm sure of it, he's Manchester through and through. The whole club is a struggle, but he has it in his locker.\"",
      "The former Real Madrid star acknowledged the possibility of Rashford moving to another team but questioned who would be willing to meet his high value, adding: \"He might leave but his value is so high, who would pay it?\" Owen further cast doubt over the notion, mentioning questions around Rashford's attitude and current form. \"They might be thinking, is his attitude right? Is he in great form? I don't see how it can all come together at the moment,\" he argued.",
      "While there was mention of PSG potentially taking advantage of Rashford's unsettled situation, Owen deemed it unlikely, attributing such conjecture to the rumour mill, reports the Mirror. He continued: \"There was talk of PSG but I can't see that.",
      "\"Who can afford him? I just don't believe all this b*****ks that goes round all the time at this part of the year, it never happens.\"",
      "Rashford's future at United has been in question after he found himself struggling for form and being dropped from Gareth Southgate's 33-man preliminary England squad for the European Championships taking place in Germany. The fact that United chose to stand by manager Erik ten Hag despite a disastrous season just adds to these uncertainties.",
      "Despite these concerns, Rashford silenced doubters recently when he expressed his love for the club in an emotional Instagram post, sharing a photo of himself on Instagram, in tears, after United's FA Cup triumph in May and captioning it \"That's what the club means to me\".",
      "Owen further emphasised his point, discussing how the media often stirs up trouble during the transfer window and ahead of major tournaments, yet most of it never results in anything substantial. His comments were specifically in reference to Rashford's situation and the recent negative press surrounding him.",
      "\"This time of year is hilarious. Two or three months before every World Cup there is this big crisis everyone talks about,\" Owen said. \"When the World Cup was in South America there were these killer mosquitos that were going to kill everyone, then one of the next ones was the stadiums not getting built and so on. Then lo and behold they are brilliant World Cups.",
      "\"Football is the same, with about five or six games to go, all the teams doing poorly get numerous articles of big clear outs. They say it every single year and the reality is two players go and you have barely heard of them.\"",

      "\"Second half, we're down to 10 men and I thought lads dug in really well. We're so well backed over here, today was hugely disappointing. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it's a quick turnaround now. Maybe it's a reminder of how tough this tournament is.",

      "\"I love watching skilful players, absolutely love it and the talent we saw from the German players tonight was great to watch. But my goodness, when you are playing football at this level, you've got to hit people. Hit them properly, hit them aggressively and do it in the right way.",
      "\"If you step off against them like Scotland did tonight and it's no good talking after the game saying 'we had a game plan'... it's rubbish! Andy Robertson, it's all just rubbish coming out. You knew before the game what was at stake and after the game it's no good going, 'we'll regroup and we'll be angry tomorrow.'",

      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",

      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",

      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",

With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",

      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",

Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Man Utd have had a £35m move for the Everton defender turned down",
      "Manchester United's hopes of forcing Everton to accept a cut-price fee for England defender Jarrad Branthwaite could be scuppered by the emergence of Arsenal as transfer rivals.",
      "United had an opening bid of £35million for Branthwaite rejected by Everton on Friday. The Toffees value the centre-half at between £70m-£80m and are determined to hold out for a fee closer to their price tag.",
      "United are set to return with an increased offer but MEN Sport understands that they don't believe the defender is worth that asking price.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already indicated that United won't be forced into paying over the odds for players, and that the days of huge transfer spends are long gone. The involvement of Ineos, who have taken over the footballing operation at United, will see a more streetwise and potentially frugal approach to recruitment, with the club determined to get value for money, having spent £1billion on players since their last Premier League title.",
      "The opening bid for Branthwaite is seen as United marking an early line in the sand, in what is Ineos' first transfer window at United. And they hope to take advantage of Everton's need to sell before the June 30 deadline to meet the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR).",
      "Everton have fallen foul to the regulations twice, with points docked last season. They need to sell a player before the end of the month, with Branthwaite one of their most bankable assets.",
      "However, the Toffees are insisting they want to hang on to their prized asset and are hoping to raise the funds through selling Amadou Onana instead. The powerhouse midfielder is valued at £50m by Everton.",
      "And Arsenal have looked to steal a march on signing the player by contacting Everton over the Belgium international on Friday. Mikel Arteta's side are keen on the 22-year-old and could be willing to match the valuation to get a deal done.",
      "Everton are believed to be much more open to selling Onana than they are Branthwaite. Joe Thomas, Everton correspondent at the Liverpool Echo, said: \"While his talent is valued at Everton he has not been at the heart of the plans of Sean Dyche. He was left on the bench for each of the games in the week that redefined Everton’s season when wins over Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Brentford secured safety.",
      "\"Should Arsenal follow up contact with a bid before the end of the month then it could damage Manchester United’s pursuit of Branthwaite. The sale of a player before the end of the football financial year would strengthen Everton’s hopes of complying with Premier League Profit and Sustainability Regulations for the first time in three years and therefore avoiding a third points deduction.",
      "\"If that was to be Onana then it would help Everton’s ability to withstand efforts to prise Branthwaite from the club for a fee below his true value.\"",

      "Solskjaer survived embarrassing defeats to Liverpool and Manchester City, but United's 4-1 loss against Watford was the result that saw the Norwegian lose his job.",

      "Kieran McKenna, a former member of Solskjaer's staff at United, was contacted about replacing Ten Hag, and it's fascinating to see what the Norwegian's staff are doing now...",
      "Michael Carrick",
      "After serving under Jose Mourinho, Carrick was retained as first-team coach under Solskjaer and was a valued member of his backroom staff. Carrick took caretaker charge of United after Solskjaer's sacking and served in that role for three games.",
      "The former midfielder oversaw wins against Villarreal and Arsenal and a draw against Chelsea during his spell on the touchline and decided to take a break after leaving Old Trafford.",

      "Ramsay had a pivotal role in preparing the squad to win games and an increased role in planning and taking sessions. Ten Hag drove the group tactically and Ramsay was one of a group of coaches that echoed his messages.",
      "Ramsay can speak fluent Spanish and was an asset to Solskjaer and subsequently, Ten Hag when the Norwegian was sacked. He helped integrate players like Casemiro at Carrington and took his first job in management with MLS side Minnesota United in February.",

      "Darren Fletcher",
      "Solskjaer promoted Fletcher from his academy coaching role to the first-team during his tenure. Fletcher was then promoted again in March 2021 when the club announced he had been chosen to become the inaugural technical director at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher's role involved working closely with former football director John Murtough, 'to add technical input and direction into all football and performance areas'. He was regularly present at academy matches and acted as the conduit between the youth system and first-team.",

It was reported earlier this week that United have named Zirkzee as part of a three-man striker shortlist, with Lille's Jonathan David and Brentford's Ivan Toney the other two.",

His performances have not gone unnoticed, with a number of other clubs interested in his services. One of those is AC Milan, who are said to be leading the race to sign him this summer.",

It's understood the ex-Bayern Munich forward is keen to stay in Italy and move to the San Siro with Milan ahead of next season.",

From his winner in the FA Cup final and his performances in the Premier League, the 19-year-old has exceeded all expectations and therefore, selling him now would be a huge mistake.

      "Jadon Sancho says he will be \"forever grateful\" to Edin Terzic for \"trusting me\" after the 41-year-old left Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Following the news of Terzic's departure, Sancho posted on Instagram: \"Thank you for trusting me! [love heart emoji]. Forever grateful!",
      "\"I wish you the best of luck on your next chapter!\"",
      "Terzic was appointed interim manager of Dortmund in December 2020 after Lucien Favre was sacked and it was his appointment that helped Sancho earn a £73m move to Manchester United as Dortmund lifted the DFB-Pokal trophy.",
      "Following his return to Dortmund on loan in January, 24-year-old Sancho scored three goals and laid on three assists as Dortmund reached the Champions League final at Wembley.",
      "Sancho is due to report back to United in July when pre-season begins, with the winger facing an uncertain summer which is likely to end in him departing Old Trafford for good, be it loan side Dortmund or an alternative side.",

      "Manchester United are looking to strengthen their defensive and strike options this summer as Erik ten Hag looks to prove doubters wrong",
      "Transfer speculation surrounding Manchester United has intensified with Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite reportedly close to agreeing to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Uncertainty over Erik ten Hag's future as manager disappeared after the club showed their faith in the Dutchman, despite links with numerous successors after their FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "United face a crucial transfer window this summer as they look to improve upon their eighth place finish in the Premier League. Their triumph in the domestic cup salvaged the campaign as they secured European football next season, booking their place in the Europa League. Several key areas have been pinpointed by recruitment bosses in Manchester including central defence and a forward player.",
      "Jason Wilcox has been in situ at Old Trafford as technical director since arriving from Southampton in April, while CEO Omar Berrada will take up his new position next month. However the uncertainty over Dan Ashworth's appointment as sporting director continues after being placed on gardening leave by Newcastle United following United's interest.",
      "The MEN understands Branthwaite is a leading target at centre-back and the 'first' deadline of the window looms large. Everton could look to sell before June 30 to improve their own PSR position.",
      "A valuation of £75million would put United off, who have PSR concerns of their own to deal with. Bremer and Edmond Tapsoba are alternative targets and, depending on departures, two central defenders could be signed.",
      "The Liverpool ECHO reported on Friday that United launched an audacious bid in the region of £38million for the defender, which is set to be rejected. Reports emerged this week that personal terms had already been agreed with the 21-year-old and The Times reported that the Toffees defender could earn in the region of £160,000-per-week.",
      "Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt has been linked as a possible alternative to the recent England debutant. Ten Hag knows the centre-back well from their time together at Ajax and reports in Germany have surfaced this week that the Bavarians could look to off-load the 24-year-old. The possibility of his departure could have intensified after Vincent Kompany's side added Hiroki Ito to the fold with further links to Bundesliga champion Jonathan Tah.",
      "United have also been name-checked as a team in the race to sign Benfica starlet Joao Neves. However, they're not alone in the race for the talent, it has been reported, with Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain among the clubs interested but the sticking point is likely to be his eye-watering €100million (£84m) price-tag. A move for the 19-year-old would be a marker of intent from United as they look to re-establish themselves on the international stage after suffering a decline in recent years.",
      "It became obvious that goalscoring was a problem for United last season during a period when Marcus Rashford's struggles coincided with Rasmus Hojlund's profligacy in front of goal. With the departure of Anthony Martial, who's contract will expire at the end of June, there is an added desire to bolster forward options at Old Trafford.",
      "Michael Olise has been credited as a player of interest at the Theatre of Dreams after his eye-catching performances for Crystal Palace. United got a first-hand look at the Frenchman's qualities when he was instrumental in Palace's 4-0 win over United at Selhurst Park during a strong finish to the campaign for Oliver Glasner's side. United will face competition for his signature and Chelsea have seemingly stolen a march for the talented winger after The Athletic reported that the West London club made contact with the club over a move.",
      "Both Bayern Munich and Newcastle United were also said to have registered an interest with Palace, while United and rival Manchester City were among those keeping tabs on the situation. Another forward linked with Old Trafford is Joshua Zirkzee after a scintillating campaign with Bologna, securing Champions League football for Thiago Motta's side.",
      "The Telegraph reported that United joined Arsenal in the hunt for the Dutchman, who was a late inclusion in their Euro 2024 squad for the upcoming tournament in Germany, with the 24-year-old having a £33million release clause in his deal. United are on the hunt for an attacking option to improve their strikeforce and the former Bayern talisman could be an option.",

      "The refurbishment will begin next week and architectural firm Foster & Partners, which is led by Manchester-born Norman Foster, have been appointed to lead the project.",
      "The firm has a history of designing football stadiums and arenas. They were responsible for the reshaping of Wembley Stadium and the design of the Lusail Stadium in Qatar.",
      "The renovation work is expected to be ongoing for the duration of the 2024/25 season and the initial focus will be on the gym, medical, nutrition and recovery areas for the players.",
      "United have said the design will place an emphasis on creating more space for collaboration and innovation among players and staff. The club have also confirmed temporary adaptations will be made to the rest of the Carrington site to ensure players and staff from all teams can continue to operate successfully next season, which will be Erik ten Hag's third year in charge.",
      "United invested £10m to create a state-of-the-art women’s and academy building last summer and once the refurbishment of the men's building is complete, the spending will total £60m.",
      "Club sources have indicated the £50m will be drawn from the $300m fund that Sir Jim Ratcliffe committed for infrastructure as part of his acquisition of a minority stake.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “We want to create a world-class environment for our teams to win. When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington training facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers.",
      "\"This project will ensure Manchester United’s training ground is once more renovated to the highest standards. Lord Foster, a fellow Mancunian, has brought some great inspiration to the design, in conjunction with the Manchester United team and we look forward to seeing the improvement to the facilities but most importantly on the pitch.”",
      "Architect Lord Foster said: “We are delighted to lead the renewal of Manchester United’s training facility in Carrington. Our aim is to modernise and revitalise the building as a catalyst for future footballing success, creating spaces that inspire a culture of collaboration, unity and belonging.",
      "“As a proud Mancunian, it is a particular honour for me to see Foster & Partners given this responsibility and we will ensure that our design captures the spirit of industry, grit and ambition that exemplifies both Manchester and Manchester United.”",
      "United moved from The Cliff to Carrington in 2000 and the training ground was a world-class facility two decades ago, but it's fallen behind other facilities in recent years.",
      "The club have explored the possibility of buying nearby farming land to expand Carrington but could encounter issues with building football pitches on soil used for food production.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo publicly criticised Carrington in his interview with Piers Morgan in 2022. “Nothing changes. Not only the jacuzzi, the pool, even the gym. Even some points of technology, the kitchen, the chefs - who I appreciate, lovely people,\" he said.\"They stop in time, which surprised me a lot. I thought I would see different things: technology, infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see many things I’m used to seeing when I’m 21, 22, 23. It surprised me a lot.”",

      "Man Utd suffered an unrelenting injury crisis last season but some of their most important players have returned for international duty this summer.",
      "The key to Manchester United finding improvement under Erik ten Hag next season doesn't primarily lie with the manager's tactics, or how the summer transfer window unfolds, but what happens in the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "There were several factors involved as last season turned into an unmitigated disaster - until the final act - but chief among them was an injury crisis that left Ten Hag searching for solutions, particularly in defence.",
      "The Dutchman had to turn to numerous different combinations at the back, using 14 different partnerships at the centre of defence and going almost the entire campaign without a natural left-back. Had there been more stability in defence then there is no doubt performances would have been better.",
      "That makes it essential that the underlying reasons for such a desperate injury record are discovered and the necessary changes made. But before the squad return to pre-season training from July 8 onwards, Ten Hag and his coaches will cross their fingers that the players on international duty return without picking up any further injuries.",
      "Particular attention will be paid to Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw, the two players United missed more than any others last season. Martinez managed just 14 appearances last season and Shaw 15, with neither playing more than 1,175 minutes.",
      "Crucially for Argentina and England, they have recovered from club seasons disrupted by injury to represent their nations at the Copa America and European Championship respectively. That they enter those tournaments relatively fresh will be encouraging for their countries and if they get through them unscathed United might benefit, but they will desperately hope they do get through them.",
      "There will be plenty of eyes on Shaw, who hasn't played for United since February 18 and has a history of picking up injuries. If he is fit enough to play in England's second group game it will be four months since he last kicked a ball competitively and while he is the only natural left-back in England's squad they need to treat him with caution.",
      "Martinez returned to fitness in time to play for United towards the end of the season and his presence in the FA Cup final team made a major difference to the performance level. He is the most aggressive centre-back in the squad, excellent in defending one-on-one and also the best ball player at the back. The balance he brings is vital to the way United build up play.",
      "Martinez probably edges Shaw as the player most missed by United last season and having suffered muscle injuries as well as a recurrence of his foot problem, there will be a focus on how he gets through a busy tournament with Argentina, who kick off their Copa America campaign next Friday.",
      "They play Canada, Peru and Chile in the group stages in the United States and could play a further three knockout matches before the final on July 14. Argentina will be guaranteed the six games if they reach the semi-finals, with a third and fourth-place play-off on the final weekend.",
      "A run that deep would delay Martinez's return to pre-season training but it is more important for United he comes through it fit and in form. After such a quiet 2023/24, they will be content to grant him a couple of weeks off in July and will be desperately hoping he is fit and firing to start the next domestic season.",
      "Ten Hag won't want to do without his former Ajax centre-back again.",

      "United made the offer on Friday as they stepped up their pursuit of Branthwaite, who is a leading target this summer as the club aim to sign at least one central defender. If the two clubs can agree a deal then personal terms will be a formality.",
      "They remain some way apart in their valuations at the moment, however, and Everton deemed United's opening offer unacceptable. Branthwaite is one of several central defenders under consideration at Old Trafford this summer as Erik ten Hag seeks to beef up that area of the team.",

      "Newcastle are reportedly growing concerned that Manchester City will meet Bruno Guimaraes' £100m release clause, which would also impact Man United's summer transfer plans",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly growing increasingly worried that Manchester City might table an 'irrestible' offer for their star Bruno Guimaraes, a move that could not only strip the Magpies of a key player but also send a significant blow to their neighbours Manchester United.",
      "The club has openly expressed caution in their transfer dealings due to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability regulations, which have restricted Newcastle's spending power despite the influx of funds from their Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund owners.",
      "Yet, this restraint may be lifted if City trigger the reported £100 million release clause in Guimaraes' contract, a scenario the Northern Echo suggests is becoming more probable in Newcastle's view. City manager Pep Guardiola, who is on the hunt for a long-term midfield ally for Rodri, praised Guimaraes back in March, saying: \"He is an exceptional holding midfielder.",
      "\"He is aggressive, with the ball or without the ball. At set-pieces, he's aggressive and is a real, complete holding midfielder.\" Securing Guimaraes could be a coup for Guardiola in what might be his last season at the helm of City, leaving Newcastle at a loss, yet potentially flush with funds to reinvest before the window closes.",
      "Newcastle could soon be in a position to offer more competitive financial packages to their targets, including Crystal Palace's Michael Olise, who is also said to be on United's radar and has a release clause of around £60m. The Reds are already working to strengthen Erik ten Hag's defence, having agreed personal terms with Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite, valued at £70m.",
      "Therefore, additional competition for Premier League star Olise would likely not be welcomed. With a potential £100m windfall from City and Guimaraes, Newcastle can proceed with plans to recruit Olise without the fear of breaching top-flight financial rules. However, if City want to secure Guimaraes for Guardiola, they will need to act quickly as the clause expires at the end of June.",
      "\"Having that was well planned and structured in the sense that there's a finish point,\" said Newcastle boss Howe after renewing his Brazilian star's contract. \"We don't want a summer of speculation. I don't think that would be healthy for the player or for us.\"",
      "A swift resolution may not suit United, as they might need to sell Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood before pursuing another right-winger. With Chelsea also in the running for Olise, two stronger contenders for his signature could emerge when United make their pitch to the Palace star.",

      "Erik ten Hag's side have been linked with the Slovenian international after his impressive displays in Germany which saw him score 18 goals from 42 appearances in all competitions this season, with the starlet having long been tipped for a big-money move to a major European club.",
      "However, if the Red Devils were to splash out on a major signing this summer, there'd need to be some balancing of the books in order to stay within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSRs) with a slew of departures expected this summer with their list of names that could be on their way out including Casemiro, Victor Lindelof, and Jadon Sancho who will no doubt drum up funds for United.",
      "They are also going after Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite who could cost them as much as £75 million, meaning leaving a deal for Sesko until next summer could be much more beneficial for them. And now Bundesliga journalist Christian Falk has reported that United could still have a chance of signing Sesko in the future.",
      "It's believed Leipzig have promised Sesko that he can move to a new club next summer provided there is interest in his services in 12 months time, meaning that United could go after the star with another year of experience in one of Europe's top five leagues under his belt.",

      "As soon as the transfer window opened, Ratcliffe wasted no time at all and submitted a bid for Jarrad Branthwaite. However, it's understood that Everton have turned down the Red Devils offer, which was worth £35m plus £8m in add-ons.",
      "The 21-year-old defender continues to be heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford following his impressive performances this season. While the Toffees rejected United's opening bid, it's believed that personal terms will be a formality if the two clubs can eventually reach an agreement.",
      "READ MORE:Roy Keane slams Andy Robertson over 'rubbish' comments",
      "Branthwaite has stolen the headlines lately, but he's not the only player to be rumoured with a switch. So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at every player linked with a move to Old Trafford since the summer transfer window opened on Friday.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Man United have no intention of bidding as much as £70m for Branthwaite this summer. The report states that it remains to be seen whether the two clubs can reach a compromise during negotiations as the Red Devils look for a long-term replacement for Raphael Varane.",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"Jarrad Branthwaite would be an excellent signing and I think he would complement Lisandro Martinez really well. With that being said, I don't think he's the answer to all of Man United's problems – they'd still need to sign another top centre-half in addition to his arrival.\"",
      "Man United have internally discussed a potential move for Matthijs de Ligt this summer, according to Sky Sports Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg. The report states that the Bayern Munich defender has been placed on the Red Devils' shortlist, with Erik ten Hag keen.",
      "It's said that United are in the process of gathering more information about De Ligt. The 24-year-old centre-back has been heavily linked with an exit from the Allianz Arena this summer.",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"Matthijs de Ligt hasn't necessarily fulfilled his huge potential at Bayern Munich, so it's probably the right time for him to find a new club. The centre-back worked closely with Erik ten Hag at Ajax a few years ago, so I think he do well at Man United. He's a leader too, which is really what the club needs.\"",
      "According to the Daily Express, Man United have expressed an interest in signing Oghenetejiri Adejenughure from RB Salzburg. The report states that the Red Devils have held talks with the 17-year-old's entourage to discuss a potential move.",
      "It's said that Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan are also keen on Adejenughure. He scored 16 goals in 20 games for the Salzburg under-18s this season.",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"Unlike the other names on this list, Adejenughure would clearly be one for the future, with the 17-year-old yet to make a senior appearance for the Austrian side. But amid all the talk of first-team additions needed to take United back to Europe's top table, it's pleasing to know it won't come at the expense of long-term planning.\"",
      "Matheus Cunha has recently admitted it's a 'real honour' to be linked with Man United. When asked if he will be joining the Red Devils, the Wolves forward said: \"You know it's a real honour to have your name linked to Manchester United. One of the biggest clubs in the world. But I'm happy at Wolves. If I'm lucky, I play another good season, but the window is open, you never know.\"",
      "Previously speaking to Globo Esporte, Cunha said: \"Whenever I can, I come along [to Botafogo-PB games]. I always want to show that (the affection) is reciprocated. Then we see that talk (Manchester United).",
      "\"But I’m very happy at Wolves. My focus is on resting and making the most of my time with my family. I'm very happy at Wolves. The focus now is on having better seasons and helping the club. God willing, I'll continue on this path.\"",
      "According to Mirror Football, United tracked Cunha last season and he is high on their list of potential replacements for Anthony Martial, who left the club after his contract expired.",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"Matheus Cunha would be a very good signing for United. While he's a centre-forward on paper, he's regularly featured as an attacking midfielder and second-striker. His versatility as a squad player would only be a good thing for Erik ten Hag, and while it might not be the most exciting addition, it would certainly be a pragmatic one given his Premier League experience.\"",
      "Speaking at a press conference to announce Bruno Genesio as Lille's new head coach earlier this week, club president Olivier Letang revealed that the youngster will be able to leave this summer. \"Leny Yoro and Jonathan David can leave the club this summer. Both have the ‘exit voucher’ due to their contract situation.\"",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"Yoro would certainly be a good signing for Man United. Not only has he held his own physically against the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Ollie Watkins at just the age of 18, but he's also shown great mental strength to play at the highest level in front of huge crowds. I just fear he wouldn't get as much game time as he would like.\"",

The report states that Arsenal are long admirers of the the Real Sociedad midfielder, who Mikel Arteta has identified as a replacement for Thomas Partey. Nacional add that Zubimendi has a release clause worth €59.7m (£50.5m).",
      "Manchester Evening News says: \"This is exactly the type of signing Man United should be making. Martin Zubimendi would be an excellent addition to the starting lineup, but they may need to shell out the full release clause if they're to get him. And even then, the talk in the Basque country suggests the midfielder is happy where he is for the time being\"",

      "Erik ten Hag will remain as the head coach of Manchester United for the 2024/25 season after a lengthy review was conducted by the club hierarchy.",
      "After enjoying a decent first year at Old Trafford, Ten Hag and United struggled in the second season with the club finishing eighth in the Premier League. The FA Cup final win over Manchester City did end the campaign on a positive note but uncertainty over the Dutchman's future continued to mount.",
      "It took 17 days for a decision to be made and club sources confirmed late on Tuesday that Ten Hag will remain in charge. Talks have now opened over an extension of his contract in a statement of support from Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "However, things could have been very different. Speculation surfaced over candidates to replace Ten Hag with the likes of Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel and Kieran McKenna all linked.",
      "Brentford's Thomas Frank was also a name mentioned and according to the Telegraph, the club held talks with his representatives while Ten Hag and the United squad travelled to Wembley for the FA Cup final.",
      "Frank was reported to be a 'strong' candidate for United to replace Ten Hag. After taking over the Bees in 2018, he took them to the Premier League and has since recorded three campaigns in the top flight.",
      "The decision to delay Ten Hag's status at the club has resulted in some in the football world slamming the hierarchy's uncertainty. Former United midfield Paul Ince has blasted United's thinking behind the scenes.",
      "“Now it looks to me like they're trying to look for other managers to see who are prepared to go to Manchester United, having meetings with Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino, that is a lack of respect, it’s disrespectful for the manager at the football club,\" he told Bet365.",

      "“There has to be and I think it's so unfair on Ten Hag I really, really do. It's total madness what's going on here. Don't kind of play this game where you are calling other managers, Pochettino or Roberto Di Zerbi or whoever, before making your decision.",

      "Man United's transfer record has been poor over the years and here are some of the club's biggest flops in the market.",
      "Manchester United's recruitment has been awful in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Now that the transfer window has reopened and there is a new regime in town, the mistakes of the past must be avoided.",
      "\"What’s happened is, we have burned through cash,\" former United CEO Richard Arnold said (along with an expletive) in 2022 when meeting fans for an impromptu chat in a beer garden.",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong - United have spent over £1billion on transfers over the last decade and they haven't come close to winning the Premier League title.",
      "The scattergun transfer strategy is one of the main reasons for United's decline and there have been various transfer flops. It's a strategy that the new regime at Old Trafford, headed up by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, are keen to avoid. Ratcliffe, speaking a few years ago, called United's recruitment 'shockingly poor'.",
      "\"[Ineos] never wants to be the dumb money in town, never,\" Ratcliffe said. So here are 10 of some of the biggest transfer flops United have signed that probably fit that bill.",
      "Antony was signed in a deal worth £86m from Ajax in Erik ten Hag's first summer in charge. The Dutchman pushed hard to sign the winger, who he worked with at the Amsterdam Arena, and United agreed to a deal despite Ajax's valuation increasing throughout the window.",
      "The Brazilian still has time to turn around his career at the club, but considering the fee invested to sign him, he's been an awful transfer and must improve next season.",
      "Antony contributed just one goal and one assist in the whole of the 2023/24 Premier League campaign.",
      "Alexis Sanchez was signed from Arsenal in a straight swap deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, so he didn't cost a transfer fee, but he earned astronomical wages during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "The Chilean scored five goals and recorded nine assists in 45 appearances and failed to produce the form he did at Arsenal, which saw him excel in the Premier League.",
      "Sanchez was the highest-paid player in the Premier League and it's thought he earned £560,000 per week. He joined Inter Milan on loan in 2019 and later signed permanently.",
      "Mkhitaryan was used in the swap deal for Sanchez and was a transfer flop himself at United. His performances for Borussia Dortmund were excellent and United paid £30m to lure him to Manchester, but he struggled in the Premier League and was soon axed from the starting XI.",
      "The Armenia international's relationship with Jose Mourinho broke down and he was used as a makeweight in the deal to sign Sanchez.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson hadn't seen Bebe play before finalising a £7million deal to sign him, and when the winger did get a game for United, he was a major disappointment.",
      "He made just seven appearances for United before leaving in 2014 to join Benfica. Bebe is now 33 and stunned United fans in January when representing Cape Verde at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Donny van de Beek was a Ballon d'Or nominee in 2019 after his influential role in Ajax's domestic double triumph and progression to the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "Just a year later, his arrival at United for £35m was considered a coup, but his time at the club has been a disaster and his recent loan with Eintracht Frankfurt didn't work out.",
      "Van de Beek's nightmare continued at Eintracht - he was left out of their European squad shortly after signing - and he's under contract at United until 2025.",
      "There was excitement when United signed Memphis Depay from PSV Eindhoven in a deal worth £31m in 2015, but he never fulfilled his potential in two years at the club.",
      "After the departure of Angel Di Maria, Depay took the famous No.7 shirt - previously worn by George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. He struggled with the weight of that shirt at Old Trafford and eventually signed for Lyon in January 2017.",
      "Morgan Schneiderlin signed from Southampton in 2015, arriving for a fee in the region of £25m, but he became 'lost' as a player under the demands of Louis van Gaal.",
      "\"I was too affected by what Louis van Gaal was asking from me,\" he said last year. \"I lost me as a player. It was not me on the field. It was not just the manager's fault, it was my fault, too.",
      "\"My role was not the one I had at Southampton. I felt restricted. I felt they wanted to change things in me. I was not thinking as me, I was thinking about what pleased the coach.\"",
      "The midfielder joined Everton in 2017 and had stints with Nice, Western Sydney Wanderers, Konyaspor and A.E. Kifisia after his time at Goodison Park.",
      "Pogba seemed to have the world at his feet when he re-signed for United in 2016 for a then-world-record transfer fee of £89million. He'd established himself as one of Europe's finest midfielders during his Juventus stint and his return to Manchester dominated global headlines.",
      "But Pogba left United on a free transfer in 2022, 10 years after he last left the club as a free agent, having won just the Europa League and the League Cup in six years.",
      "The Frenchman was supremely talented and should have achieved more with United.",
      "Although Radamel Falcao is the only loan player included on this list, he had to be included because United paid Monaco £6.8m to sign him on a season-long deal.",
      "\"When a player of this calibre becomes available, it is an opportunity not to be missed,\" said then-United manager Van Gaal of Falcao in September 2014.",
      "However, Falcao only managed to score four goals in 29 appearances and Chelsea decided to give him a chance the following season, despite flopping at United.",
      "He was a disappointing signing for United and scored just once at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Di Maria appeared to shout 'eff off' to a section of home fans at Old Trafford after Paris Saint-Germain's opener in the first knockout round of the Champions League in February 2019.",
      "Di Maria was booed with every touch of the ball that night, as he returned for the first time since he departed the club in 2015. He received a hostile reception and was targeted by a bottle in the second half as he went to take a corner.",
      "United signed him for a British record transfer fee of £59.7million in the summer of 2014 but he flopped, just like the other players on the list.",

      "Man Utd are used to dealing with some bizarre stories on a transfer rumour and the latest reports in Spain fit neatly into that category.",
      "There would have been a few chuckles around Old Trafford at stories in the Catalan press suggesting Barcelona are eyeing up Kobbie Mainoo. This is the Barcelona who can't register all the players they currently have to play in La Liga next season, never mind sign any more.",
      "The financial demise of Barca is a story all of European football is following. Everyone knows that they don't have the spending power of old. Everyone, that is, apart from most of Catalonia.",
      "So the idea, floated in Catalan-based publication El Nacional, that Hansi Flick wants the club to sign Mainoo is about as likely as United winning the Champions League next season. They don't have enough cash to sign his left foot, never mind the rest of the 19-year-old, who is absolutely not for sale anyway.",
      "He is one of the few untouchables this summer, chiefly alongside fellow young guns Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund. They could be the future of United and Mainoo certainly is. His first season in the first team was evidence of that.",
      "It's why he is now being linked to clubs like Barcelona and more will follow. Mainoo is that rare breed - although increasingly less rare these days it must be said - of an English midfielder who has the ability to grace the Nou Camp and just about any other stadium in the world.",
      "After 35 senior appearances, he is already one of the best players in the United team and a key man in the midfield. He is wonderfully press-resistant, an intelligent player with an eye for a goal and an ability to find excellent finishes. He might not begin Euro 2024 in England's starting XI, but don't be surprised if he makes an impact in the tournament.",
      "He will certainly feature in Germany and if he does shine for his country in the manner he has done so for his club this season then we can expect more stories in the foreign press linking him with moves away. Maybe it will be Real Madrid next, or Bayern Munich. It's only Europe's very elite who would be realistic suitors.",
      "United certainly need to rejoin that category as quickly as they can. In Mainoo and Garnacho they have a pair of 19-year-olds who are among the most talented players of their generation and they need the platform at Old Trafford to achieve the success their games deserve.",
      "But at the moment they also have the ideal platform to keep developing. They are almost undroppable given the form they showed last season. Garnacho earned himself a five-year contract 14 months ago after his performances and at some point Mainoo will follow suit.",
      "The Stockport-born academy graduate is still on the contract he signed in February 2023, well before his significant senior breakout. That deal has improved since then as a result of performance factors and there is no rush to get a deal signed.",
      "United have been relaxed about the situation for months given he still has three years left, plus the option of another year, on his current contract. Having waited for the season to finish first, Mainoo's remarkable rise now means he is spending the summer at a major tournament.",
      "It is just a matter of time, however. United won't sell Mainoo and he doesn't want to leave his boyhood club. At some point in the not-so-distant future he will pose for the obligatory photo with pen in hand, smile fixed on the camera, ink about to be applied to contract.",
      "Until then, United can probably expect another fanciful story or two linking the shining star of their academy with another club. But right now there's only one club for Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Manchester United have made their first move for Jarrad Branthwaite after impressing for Everton during the 2023/24 season",
      "Manchester United have made an 'opening offer' for Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, according to reports, as Erik ten Hag tries to bolster his defensive unit this summer.",
      "But an initial bid of £35m has been rejected by the Toffees who deemed the offer to be 'unacceptable', The Athletic reports.",
      "United are set to add another centre-back following the departure of Raphael Varane at the end of his contract this month. If the club do not extend Jonny Evans' deal, it would leave four senior central defenders in the squad, with Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Willy Kambwala the quartet.",
      "Although some may say that four or five is enough, last season United were forced to use Casemiro at centre-back due to an injury crisis and the Red Devils are no doubt keen to ensure that doesn't happen very often again. It's why Branthwaite has emerged as a serious option to bolster their back-line.",
      "Everton look set to sell one of their main assets before the end of June to stay in line with Premier League profit and sustainability rules, though they do not want to part ways with him below the £70million valuation.",
      "United are not the only team tracking his situation, with Tottenham and Manchester City both among his potential suitors. It's no surprise that more than just United are interested in Branthwaite, however, after the England international enjoyed an excellent season at Everton under Sean Dyche.",
      "Having spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with PSV, Branthwaite returned to the Toffees and almost immediately knocked Michael Keane out of the side to partner James Tarkowski. That duo, alongside Jordan Pickford, gave the Toffees a solid base which helped them be the fourth-meanest defence in the Premier League.",
      "In fact, Everton conceded 51 goals in 38 top-flight fixtures, with only Arsenal (29), Manchester City (34) and Liverpool (41) shipping fewer. However, the Toffees did keep the second-most clean sheets in the division with 13, only behind Arsenal (18). Branthwaite started 35 league matches last season.",
      "There is no doubt Branthwaite was one of the standout defenders in the Premier League. He averaged 1.9 tackles, 1.4 interceptions, one block and 4.5 clearances per match in the 2023/24 campaign - with Branthwaite featuring near the top for centre-backs in each of those categories.",
      "Defensively, Branthwaite has proved himself. Standing at 6\"4, he is a commanding and strong central defender with a great leap and is excellent at winning his duels. He has also got a fast burst of acceleration which allows him to reach optimal speed when in a foot race with quick attackers.",
      "On the ball, Branthwaite is composed and would fit straight into the XI at Old Trafford. He averaged 39 passes per match with a success rate of 80 per cent in the Premier League last season. Although Everton are not predominately a possession-based side, Branthwaite showed his capabilities on the ball.",
      "His goal threat came in handy, too, as Branthwaite scored three goals last season. His first came in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham in February, bundling home a loose ball from close-range. That was followed up with a terrific strike against Brighton and a neat finish in the win over Liverpool. He was unfortunate not to score more, with Branthwaite often providing a handful in the air from set pieces.",
      "There is a lot to like about Branthwaite, who has age on his side compared to other alternatives and also has the capacity to improve and become even better.",

      "Erik ten Hag is to stay on as Man United manager after discussions with Ineos chiefs but recruitment could remain a big issue this summer.",
      "Over the last couple of years it has looked like Erik ten Hag has had free reign when it comes to dictating Manchester United's transfer strategy. Rarely did the approach deviate from players he has worked with or players attached to the Sports Entertainment Group of his agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Ten Hag might not have held the pursestrings but he held the power, with Vos heavily involved in supplying players to the United first-team. Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Wout Weghorst Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Rasmus Hojlund. The connections to Ten Hag, Vos or the Eredivisie were everywhere.",
      "Those close to the process have always insisted there is a perfectly fair explanation for this. United were revamping their recruitment department when Ten Hag arrived and the Dutchman felt he could better trust his judgement as he built a squad to challenge.",
      "When he did want a player, the recruitment department would create a shortlist of five options to be presented to Ten Hag and football director John Murtough. The manager was essentially free to pick his preference from that list and it regularly included the players he had associations with.",
      "In the case of some, that was hardly surprising, and there are successes there. Ten Hag pushed for the signing of Martinez from Ajax when the recruitment department preferred to go for Villarreal's left-footed centre-back Pau Torres. But there are failures too, most notably the £86million spent on Antony, who has rarely looked like coming close to fulfilling that price tag.",
      "Now, as Ten Hag enters his third summer window and looks to build on the £400m he has spent across the previous two, the dynamic is changing. It will almost certainly shift again before January.",
      "His current contract allows a veto on transfers and whether that remains will be a key part of contract discussions going forward. Either way, Ten Hag will want a substantial say in recruitment.",
      "Before starting work at United he said in an interview in Holland that \"control in transfers is a condition for me.\" Ineos want to get away from that model and eventually control in recruitment will be the responsibility of sporting director Dan Ashworth.",
      "In his absence this summer it is technical director Jason Wilcox who will lead the window, supported by director of football negotiations Matt Hargreaves and deputy football director Andy O'Boyle, who has impressed Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Ineos want to give Ten Hag their backing having settled on keeping faith with him now, but there is also a sense that faith only stretches so far. They won't want to let the 54-year-old dominate the window if he doesn't elicit improvements next season and is dispensed with.",
      "That is the culture Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to get away from. It's why he's ripped up the football structure since his investment into the club was confirmed in February. It's also why bringing in his own man would have allowed the dynamics of power to be clearly defined.",
      "Instead, Ineos have to make it work with Ten Hag and Wilcox. They must find common ground this summer. The days of a five-man shortlist might be over but the window will present different challenges this summer. Ten Hag is unlikely to get it all his own way.",

      "Manchester United have long been rumoured to hold interest in Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite following his impressive defensive displays under Sean Dyche over the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Having played 90 minutes in all but one of his 35 Premier League appearances this season, the 21-year-old was also included in Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man England squad ahead of the European Championships but was cut from the group as one of the seven players to not make it into the final 26.",
      "Following the departure of Raphael Varane at the end of the season, and the likely upcoming exit of Jonny Evans at the end of his contract, Erik ten Hag's priority this season must be to bolster up his defensive ranks after their calamitous displays throughout the past few months.",
      "Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Willy Kambwala would be the remaining quartet of centre-backs and it's clear now the Dutchman seeks to add Branthwaite to that list. With Everton also in financial trouble, it'd be no surprise to see them cash in on the star this summer in order to both balance out their books in terms of the Premier League's PSRs (Profit and Sustainability Regulations) as well as drum up some funds amid an ownership crisis that saw their prospective deal with 777 Partners fall through rapidly.",
      "The Toffees are said to hold Branthwaite in the same class as the likes of Maguire, who United splashed £80m on to bring him over from Leicester City back in 2019, and are likely to want to command a similar fee from the Red Devils after their primary new investor Sir Jim Ratcliffe confirmed Ten Hag would stay as manager this week.",
      "So with all that said, we've taken a look at the latest on the future of the Branthwaite-United saga this summer.",
      "Manchester United have formally submitted a £35m bid for Branthwaite, with Everton set to swiftly reject the offer. It's long been believed the Toffees will command a fee of at least £70m for the star after his performances under Sean Dyche led him to Gareth Southgate's 33-man provisional England squad for the Euros.",
      "Sean Dyche has already claimed he doesn't want to let the youngster go this summer, with the star having been such a pivotal part of his side's victorious fight against relegation this season.",
      "Speaking in March, he said: “We don’t want to sell any good players. It’s as simple as that and he’s proven to be a very good player. We’re not in the business of trying to sell players.",
      "\"You only sell players if you have to sell players or there’s a problem. There’s no problem, therefore I’m just hoping we don’t need to sell players. At the minute, we certainly don’t so we will see.",
      "\"What I saw of him, I liked. When the timing was right, I thought ‘go on then, go and enjoy it, go and have a go’. I didn’t have to say anything to him, just go and play. He’s adapted well.",
      "\"There are things he still needs to work on, but you unravel a player slowly, you can’t just fast-track everything into them and say ‘that’s it’. So while he’s developing nicely and while he’s learning, sometimes the hardest thing is not to coach at all when you just step away and go ‘no, no, you’re fine, you keep doing what you’re doing’.\"",
      "Reports seem to suggest that following discussions between the two camps, they have come to an agreement on personal terms but that there is still a large gap in between United's valuation of the player and Everton's which could hold the deal from going through in the next few days at least.",
      "With United's bid of £35m being around half of what Everton would ideally want for the star, it seems as though there's a lot more to be done at the negotiating table between the two clubs before Branthwaite truly has his say on the ordeal.",
      "Earlier in the season, when asked about the rumours of a potential move to Man United, Branthwaite simply shrugged off the comments and reiterated his focus to keeping Everton in the Premier League for next season.",
      "Speaking in April, he said: \"You have just got to block it all out. I think if you focus on the outside stuff, you get distracted from what you need to do on the pitch.\"",

      "And the buzz of the city centre around Marienplatz, where Scottish supporters are congregating, only increased following the appearance of the Glaswegian, reports the Mirror. Ferguson, who once steered Scotland at the 1986 World Cup, joined his compatriots in support for what is only their sixth major tournament appearance since that time.",
      "The 82-year-old had been among the coaching staff prior to the 1986 tournament when Jock Stein, then in charge of the national team, died in September 1985. Ferguson stepped into the role on a temporary basis, leading his country to Mexico where Scotland suffered a group stage exit following defeats to Denmark and West Germany.",
      "Ferguson stepped down after the tournament and would be appointed manager at Manchester United in November that year. The rest is history.",
      "Germany are the third favourites to win the tournament, trailing behind France and England. Despite the odds being heavily stacked against Scotland, fans remain hopeful for a positive outcome in Friday night's game.",
      "Scotland has yet to secure a victory against Germany in a competitive match, with only one win out of their last nine games a 2-0 friendly triumph over Gibraltar earlier this month.",

      "Luke Shaw featured just 15 times for Manchester United during 2023/24 and Rio Ferdinand has offered his verdict on whether the club should stick by him",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed that Luke Shaw should not feel disgruntled if Manchester United replace him next season due to his damning injury record.",
      "Shaw has not featured since since February after suffering a muscle injury during the 2-1 win over Luton. The 28-year-old tried to return in time for the FA Cup final against Manchester City but did not make it. That meant Shaw played just 15 matches for United in the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite not playing a minute of first-team football for over three months, Shaw has been named in the England squad for Euro 2024. He has been training this week and could feature in their tournament opener against Serbia on Sunday. If he does feature, it would be his first Three Lions appearance in 2024.",
      "His injury record has not been the greatest over the years, not just the past season, however. In fact, Shaw has suffered 24 different injuries and missed 265 matches during his United career since signing from Southampton. When fit, Shaw is one of the best defenders in world football, but Ferdinand is unsure whether United and Erik ten Hag can keep risking his fitness going into next season.",
      "\"They've got to get a fit Shaw and Lisandro Martinez next season and games out of them both,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I don’t think Shaw could be disgruntled if United said because of his lack of game time over the last course of your time here, we're going to find another left back.",
      "\"I don't think he could grumble at that. But I think he's that good when he plays that they will go again [with him].\"",
      "United confirmed earlier this week that Ten Hag will be staying at the club as manager next season. That was following an end-of-season review from Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip as new Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho is reportedly interested in reuniting with a United player",
      "Jose Mourinho is reportedly targeting a reunion with a Manchester United player this summer.",
      "The summer transfer window is officially open and United, along with other Premier League clubs, are able to complete deals for new signings. The Reds have already been credited with an interest in several potential new signings ahead of Erik ten Hag's third season at Old Trafford.",
      "Rumours also continue to swirl around the future of players already at United. And some of the latest speculation has stated that Mourinho is seeking a reunion with a player he once coached at Old Trafford.",
      "Mourinho was appointed as manager of Turkish club Fenerbahce last week. Now there are reports the former United boss wants to bring a Reds player to the Super Lig outfit.",
      "According to Turkish news outlet Fotomac, Victor Lindelof is a target for Fenerbahce. It has been claimed that the Sweden international is wanted by Mourinho as one of his first signings since moving to Turkey.",
      "The report claims that Fenerbahce are prepared to offer €8 million (£6.7 million) in an effort to prise Lindelof from United. It has also been stated that the Turkish club are expected to complete the transfer for the centre-back due to a good relationship between the two clubs.",
      "Lindelof was signed by Mourinho at United in 2017 following his first season as manager at Old Trafford. The United centre-back has gone on to make 259 appearances for the club and is currently one of only three senior central defenders contracted for next season.",
      "United have Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at the club, with Jonny Evans out of contract this summer and it remains to be seen if an extension will be agreed. Raphael Varane is set to depart as a free agent, and United are known to be looking at signing at least one centre-back this summer before any departures are factored into the situation.",

      "United have been linked with Canada attacker David amid their search for a new striker. Rasmus Hojlund is now the only natural centre-forward at the club with Anthony Martial leaving upon the end of his contract this month.",
      "David, 24, scored 26 goals in 47 matches across all competitions for Lille last season, and finished as the second highest scorer in Ligue 1 with 19 strikes in 34 outings. The forward only has 12 months remaining on his deal and a renewal with his current employers is unlikely to be agreed.",
      "Lille president Letang has in fact told David that he can leave this summer with the club at risk of seeing him leave for nothing if not sold within the next two windows.",
      "The same message has been shared with Leny Yoro, who is said to be attracting interest from United and other Premier League clubs although Real Madrid are said to be leading the way.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Letang said: \"Leny Yoro and Jonathan David can leave the club this summer. Both have the 'exit voucher' due to their contract situation.\"",
      "It’s thought the phrase ‘exit voucher’ refers to the 12 months left on their deals, rather than a release clause - despite reports mooting that David has one. Any deal for the forward could be delayed by his inclusion in Canada’s squad for their inaugural Copa America campaign this summer.",

      "There have been 250 players to make a senior debut from the academy, which is a remarkable record, but the reality is the majority of hopefuls pursue careers elsewhere.",
      "It's a challenge for any young player to be on the fringe of the senior squad, nevermind earn a regular starting role, and United's academy has been responsible for the early development of hundreds of players who enjoyed fulfilling careers throughout the English pyramid.",
      "From the outside, it can be seen as a failure for a youngster to leave United's academy and join a club in a lower division, but that's not the view of staff at Carrington or players' families.",
      "There are many reasons why young players leave United and context is important ahead of the departure of Omari Forson and the likely exit of Shola Shoretire this summer.",
      "Forson has been in protracted talks over a new contract, but new proposals from United have been rejected and he's set to leave on a free transfer at the end of this month.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands United will continue to offer Forson competitive contracts in the hope he will sign a new deal. However, the club have conceded he's expected to leave, which isn't a surprise after months of stalled contract negotiations over a fresh deal.",
      "United wanted to keep Forson and their contract proposals reflected that. He will leave with well wishes but the club won't lose sleep over his departure this summer.",
      "There is a promising young player in Forson and it will be fascinating to see what he can achieve when he leaves, but he looked raw and inexperienced when he was given a shock start against Fulham in the Premier League on February 24 - his full debut for the club.",
      "Just a day before the Fulham game, Rasmus Hojlund was ruled out with a muscle injury and Forson was selected to start on the right wing instead of £86million signing Antony.",
      "Moments after the first whistle, the 19-year-old charged down the Fulham defence and lunged into a reckless challenge, which he was lucky to escape a yellow card for. The adrenaline of the occasion had rushed to Forson's head and Erik ten Hag responded by gesturing to calm down.",
      "Ten Hag named Forson in the senior squad for the pre-season tour of the United States last summer and gave him first-team opportunities throughout 2024.",
      "Forson made his debut against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup in January, made a cameo against Newport County and was given substitute appearances against Manchester City and Arsenal in the Premier League, which felt like an effort from Ten Hag to get him to sign a new deal. He also assisted Kobbie Mainoo for his matchwinner in the 4-3 win against Wolves at Molineux.",
      "Those efforts have been in vain and the only regret United might have over his departure is not obtaining a transfer fee for him in January, although he was on track to sign a new contract in the winter and they will receive compensation when he joins a new side this summer.",
      "United will also be entitled to compensation if Shoretire leaves upon the expiry of his contract this month, which seems increasingly likely. Last month, sources indicated United remained hopeful an agreement could be reached with Shoretire but an exit is probable.",
      "Shoretire was given his first-team debut by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Newcastle in February 2021 before playing in the Europa League just a few days later, an appearance which meant he became the youngest player to appear for the club in European competition.",
      "Shoretire's progress has stalled in the last 18 months and now aged 20, it's within the player's interest to pursue regular starts at a competitive senior level.",
      "Forson and Shoretire have both fallen below the level needed to regularly start for the first team but should enjoy fulfilling careers and will always be United academy alumni.",

      "Jose Mourinho once tipped five Manchester United academy prospects for greatness as he believed they were destined to shine in football.",
      "The Portuguese coach, who has just signed a contract with Turkish club Fenerbahce, has never been shy when it comes to giving his opinion on players and rivals alike.",
      "Whether you love or hate him, there have been numerous occasions where he has stated his opinion and been proven right in the long run. However, nobody is perfect and there have been times where the 'Special One' has got it wrong – during his stint at Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "READ MORE:Manchester United appoint former Man City and Chelsea figure in further Ineos shake-up",
      "United fans were graced with plenty of memorable moments while Mourinho was the boss – during his press conferences, on match days, and in some controversial training session scenes.",
      "Back in the summer of 2017, while still holding the reins at Old Trafford, Mourinho defended his record of giving academy players a platform to succeed and also tipped five current players to achieve greatness at the club.",
      "At the time, Mourinho said: \"Probably in a few years Man United will also have half a dozen of these kids [in the team]. So when the kids are good and have potential, there is no problem.\"",
      "The manager was sacked by United in December 2018 and has since had coaching stints at Tottenham, AS Roma and now at Fenerbahce. But what happened to those five players he was impressed with while with the Red Devils? The Manchester Evening News has looked into their careers.",
      "By the time Mourinho named McTominay as one of the players to watch out for, he had already handed the Scot a Premier League debut for United against Arsenal in May 2017.",
      "Fast forward to 2024 and McTominay is still performing well at the club, scoring 10 goals and assisting three times in the 2023/24 season. He has appeared 289 times for United, scoring 29 times over eight seasons with the club.",
      "McTominay has also been performing exceptionally well for his home nation of Scotland, scoring seven times during the European Qualifiers in the latest round of matches and helped them qualify for Euro 2024.",
      "Mitchell was handed a Premier League start not long after McTominay in a season finale against Crystal Palace – but the left-back's career at Old Trafford ultimately never got going.",
      "Mitchell headed further north for the 2018/19 season with Hearts and spent his time on loan with the Edinburgh club. After 12 months back in the United academy, the young full-back departed on a permanent basis and made his breakthrough in the professional game.",
      "Mitchell was signed by League One promotion hopefuls Blackpool, and played 25 matches under ex-Liverpool youth-team manager Neil Critchley.",
      "The now-27-year-old then headed across the Scottish capital and joined Hibernian on a £300K permanent transfer – just three years on after playing for their city rivals, Hearts.",
      "He lasted just one year with the Scottish Premiership outfit and is now nursing a cruciate ligament injury at League One outfit Exeter City.",
      "Pereira is a curious case for United fans as the potential seemed to be in abundance for the young midfielder – yet he never really got going under any manager.",
      "The now-28-year-old signed for United from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in 2014 and was introduced to the first team squad in a fairly quick fashion. However, he was then sent out on a multitude of loans that included La Liga clubs Granada and Valencia, as well as Italian outfit Lazio and Brazilian club Flamengo.",
      "In the summer of 2022, United finally parted ways with Pereira and he joined fellow Premier League club Fulham in a deal reportedly worth £8million.",
      "Since then, the Brazilian international has impressed, appearing 82 times for the west London club, scoring eight times and assisting a total of 15 goals.",
      "Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut by Mourinho in the same game as McTominay but struggled to hold down a first-team place following that match.",
      "The centre-back has been loaned to Aston Villa a total of three times and has also spent time at Napoli and Stoke City.",
      "He was released by United in the summer of 2023 and found his home at Ipswich Town, scoring and assisting once during their successful 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The club completed promotion to the Premier League after defeating Huddersfield 2-0 in the final game of the Championship campaign – meaning that Tuanzebe will be facing his old club once again in the new season.",
      "Similar to fellow full-back Mitchell, Warren was surplus to United's requirements once he graduated from the club's academy system.",
      "This is a fate that many players before Warren have suffered as plenty of academy players at multiple clubs have to strive for the very best in order to compete for the first team.",
      "Warren has had a troubling time since leaving United, bouncing between various teams that included Salford's Under-21s, Boston United, Halifax Town and Barrow.",
      "The right-back's most recent move was from League Two outfit Barrow to fellow league side Grimsby Town in a £170K permanent transfer. Hopefully, the now-25-year-old can get some solid minutes under his belt and kick off his footballing career with a long-term club.",

      "United youngster Bendito Mantato was in excellent form for the academy in the spring, which explained why he was the subject of interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Although Mantato can play at left-back, it's thought his future will lie on the right wing due to his attacking quality and he scored four goals in one game against Blackburn last season.",
      "Mantato has gone from strength to strength after taking part in first-team training. His dribbling is a huge asset and he's been backed to continue to make strong headway.",
      "Ethan Williams contributed 17 goals and nine assists in academy fixtures in 2023/24 and played a crucial role in a supremely talented Under-18 side that claimed a treble.",

      "The youngster celebrated his 18th birthday in November and is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making over 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed in April last year that Ibragimov had trained with the first team at just 15 years old. That was a remarkable achievement, but those who know the Russian-born midfielder best believe there is plenty more to come from him.",

      "\"I could see him playing as a No.10, like a Wayne Rooney role, driving forward, switching balls, tackling, attacking, you name it. Just making sure the team does well - he can attack and defend.\"",

      "Manchester United's academy will play against a team assembled by former youth star and familiar face Febian Brandy this summer.",
      "Brandy started in United's academy as a youngster and progressed in the system to become a key player and regular starter in a reserve team managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Born in Moss Side, Brandy was regarded as one the most exciting talents in United's academy, winning numerous awards and featuring on the bench in a Champions League tie, but he left on loan in his late teens and eventually departed for good on a free transfer in 2010. Spells at clubs like Sheffield United, Notts County and Rotherham followed before he decided to hang his boots up in 2018.",
      "Since retirement, Brandy has created Skouted, a digital platform for football players of all levels and ages designed to help them get seen by professional scouts.",
      "\"I was quite fortunate to be at United for as long as I was, but each year I was seeing players fall out of love with football and they might not have had the ability to play for United, but they could have played at a 'lesser' club,\" Brandy told the MEN in 2021.",
      "\"They just didn’t have the connections to stay within the game. Skouted is a platform where you can put yourself in the shop window continuously with video footage to maximise your opportunities to get scouted.",
      "\"I’ve been in positions where there are no scouts around and your agent might not be doing anything - scouts now want to see some sort of footage before they progress further.\"",
      "Skouted has enjoyed success as a company in the last few years and Brandy will enjoy a full circle moment when his team of hopefuls play United's academy.",
      "United are long-term supporters of the SuperCupNI, a prestigious youth tournament held in July, and the academy will take part again, this time coming up against a Skouted team. The likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney and Marcus Rashford have featured for United in the SuperCupNI and the club's next generation will feature this summer.",
      "Skouted's side will have players from across the United Kingdom who are hopeful of impressing scouts through the company's app, which will have daily clips of player's highlights.",

      "Man United goalkeeper Mary Earps has been forced to withdraw from the England squad with a hip injury but Sarina Wiegman has now offered an update",
      "England boss Sarina Wiegman has offered a promising update on Mary Earps after the Manchester United goalkeeper picked up an injury against France on Friday.",
      "Earps was forced off just seven minutes into the Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifier at St James' Park and it was confirmed on Sunday she has had to withdraw from the squad with a hip problem. As such, she will not be available to feature for England when they face France again in Saint-Etienne on Tuesday but Wiegman does not expect the shot-stopper's injury to keep her sidelined for long.",
      "\"She can’t play tomorrow,\" Wiegman said in her pre-match press conference. \"She left as you know but it’s not too big of an injury so we expect her to be back next camp.\"",
      "READ MORE:'Only a matter of time' - Lauren Hemp makes Man City trophy promise after title race heartbreak",
      "It is good news for England, who have plenty of work to do if they are to qualify automatically for next summer's Euros. After their clash with group leaders France at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, the Lionesses - who are currently third in their four-team group - have two further games against Sweden and the Republic of Ireland in July.",
      "Only the top two teams in each group automatically progress to the tournament finals, meaning England can ill afford any more slip-ups in their qualifying campaign. Earps was replaced on Friday night by Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, who also started against Ireland in April.",
      "The 23-year-old impressed at St James' Park and, while Wiegman remained tight-lipped on her team selection for Tuesday's game, she was full of praise for Hampton, who is expected to start in Saint-Etienne.",
      "\"We are in a fortunate position that we have goalkeepers that are really good and that's the reason why Mary was in goal and also Hannah got the minutes,\" Wiegman said. \"She's good on the line and her possession game, her feet passing out is really good so we expect that tomorrow too.\"",

      "The Manchester United star believes England were the better team despite losing 2-1 at St James' Park",
      "Ella Toone believes England were the better team in Friday night's 2-1 defeat to France and says the Lionesses can learn from the performance ahead of next week's clash in Saint-Etienne.",
      "Beth Mead gave Sarina Wiegman's side the lead at St James' Park before a stunning volley from Elisa De Almeida and a fantastic first-time finish from Marie-Antoinette Katoto saw the French come from behind to further strengthen their position at the top of their EURO 2025 qualifying group.",
      "\"It's disappointing more than anything because I thought we were the better team,\" the Manchester United star Toone told the Manchester Evening News and other reporters after the game. \"I felt like we played really well.",
      "\"It was just a lapse in concentration on two set pieces which we knew they were good at. We know they've got some big players who are really good in the air and we had to make sure we concentrated so we're really disappointed to concede two goals like that. It's not the best feeling right now but I know we can learn a lot from it.",
      "\"As England we want to win every game we step into. We know that we've got a great team, a great manager and we want to go to the Euros. We won the last one and we want to go (to next summer's Euros) and do the same thing.",
      "\"Right now it hurts a little bit but we've got a few more days before we can go again which is always nice because we can rectify what we did tonight. We've got to make sure that we recover well and learn from the game but also take a lot of positives from it as well.\"",
      "The result means England are now five points behind France and currently sit third in Group A3 behind Sweden on goal difference, after they beat the Republic of Ireland 3-0. It is a major blow to their hopes of qualifying automatically for next summer's tournament finals, with the prospect of dropping into the play-offs now a distinct possibility.",
      "But, with three qualifiers still to play, Toone insists England must stay positive and believe they have what it takes to clinch one of the group's top two spots.",
      "\"We've got a squad full of experience and we know what it's like,\" she said. \"We knew this group was really tough so we can't dwell on these results. We can't dwell on tonight.",
      "\"We've got to go again in a few days so as a team we've got to make sure we switch our mindsets, we recover really well and learn from the game.\"",
      "On the prospect of facing the French on their own turf next week, Toone said: \"We've done it before. We've gone away and played in a World Cup semi-final against the host nation and we've won the game so we know what it's like to play against fans that aren't ours.",

      "The club is running out of time to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester long-term",
      "As the clock ticked down at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, the pocket of travelling Chelsea fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand opted to make Mary Earps the subject of their derision.",
      "\"Mary, what's the score?\" they crowed at the Manchester United goalkeeper, who cut a solitary, slightly despondent figure in her 18-yard box. The score, in fact, was 6-0 to Chelsea.",
      "It was United's heaviest defeat of the season and, just a week on from the Reds' FA Cup triumph at Wembley, it served as a chastening reminder of their deficiencies. Twelve months ago, there was little to separate these two sides but, in the balmy Manchester sunshine, the gulf in quality looked every bit as large as the 20-point gap between them would suggest.",
      "At the full-time whistle, Earps joined her teammates in parading the FA Cup trophy around the stadium but it was not quite the euphoric homecoming the United players had surely been hoping for. At the other end of the pitch, the away fans rubbed further salt into Earps' wound by striking up a chorus of 'England's No.1', directed at Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.",
      "While their serenade was more than a little tongue in cheek, the sentiment behind it was not as outlandish as it might have seemed last summer, when Earps won the Golden Glove at the Women's World Cup. Last month, England boss Sarina Wiegman gave the clearest indication yet that Earps' undisputed No.1 status was under threat when she gave Hampton the nod in the Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland.",
      "\"I think we're in a very luxurious position that we have two incredible goalkeepers,\" Wiegman said when quizzed on her decision to drop the United shot-stopper. \"As we saw with Mary (against Sweden), she did an incredible job but I also think that Hannah is doing a great job for Chelsea. She's growing into competition with Mary so this is a moment for her to shine.\"",
      "United's collective malaise this term has been such that it has been difficult for anyone in red to truly shine. After narrowly missing out on the Women's Super League (WSL) title in 2022/23, Marc Skinner's side have struggled to recover their best form and finished the season in fifth place - six points behind a Liverpool team who were plying their trade in the Championship only two years ago.",
      "It's little wonder, then, that Earps - whose contract expires this summer - is considering her future at the club. \"The honest reality is that conversations are still ongoing,\" the 31-year-old told Sky Sports News this week when asked about her next steps. \"I've been clear I don't want to make an emotional decision.",
      "\"The beginning of the season was really tough, I felt really upset about things that were being said about me and things that came out that weren't true.",
      "\"I've tried to be professional, keep my head down, work hard, get on with my job and that's been hard. I've been a punching bag at times. I know I've given my heart and soul for the whole season. It's a tough situation.",
      "\"I've asked the club for some confirmation on what they're trying to achieve and when I have those answers I'll be able to make a decision. It's up to the club.\"",
      "It's unsurprising that Earps has been feeling the heat of the media spotlight; she has been at the centre of intense transfer speculation since last summer, when it emerged Arsenal were interested in capturing her signature. That interest appears to have cooled of late, with the Gunners now reportedly preferring a move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar.",
      "But, while her form may have dipped slightly this season, Earps would certainly not be short of suitors should she choose to seek pastures new. She has been linked with French giants Paris Saint-Germain and her situation is being monitored by a host of top European clubs.",
      "That she appeared to put the ball in United's court in with her latest comments on her future is telling. The club came under fire last term for their inability to tie down first-team duo Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new deals, with the pair departing for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively.",
      "Though United's underwhelming campaign cannot solely be attributed to their exits, it was an indictment of the club's hierarchy that both were allowed to leave on free transfers. Now, the Reds risk losing Earps in the same manner, with the Daily Mail reporting last week that midfielder Ella Toone is also attracting interest from Barcelona.",
      "While that particular move may not materialise, with Toone under contract until June 2026, it is clear United need to do more to convince their star players that the club has a clear formula for success. Over the past 18 months, United has felt like a club in flux.",
      "In February, it was confirmed that head of women's football Polly Bancroft was set to depart at the season to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town. Matt Johnson, who currently works for the club's Foundation as well as overseeing the girls' regional and emerging talent centres (RTCs), is set to take over on an interim basis at the end of the campaign but Bancroft's long-term successor has not yet been named.",
      "Her exit comes after Skinner's highly-rated assistant Martin Ho left the club last summer to become head coach at Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner, while several other key personnel - including physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem and performance analyst Luke Wright - have moved over to join Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "This, of course, has all occurred against the backdrop of takeover uncertainty, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe eventually having acquired a minority stake in the club back in February The Ineos chief is now responsible for sporting operations, with United seeking to emerge into a brave new era under his stewardship.",
      "The fact that Ratcliffe chose to attend United's Premier League clash with Arsenal instead of watching Skinner's side lift their first piece of silverware earlier this month, however, does not instill confidence that the women's team ranks very highly on his list of priorities.",
      "Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford was in attendance on Saturday afternoon and will surely have been mildly perturbed by what he witnessed. The United hierarchy awarded Skinner - whose contract was due to expire this summer - with a new deal last week, although negotiations had been underway for some time.",
      "It was a controversial call considering the backlash Skinner has faced from some quarters of the fanbase at various points throughout the season and only time will tell whether the 41-year-old has what it takes to turn the Reds into a European force.",
      "\"I need to go away and reflect on what we need to do as a team,\" Skinner admitted in his post-match press conference at the weekend. \"I need to work with the club to make sure we know those areas. I've known for a while where we fall short, but there's also a time that you need to be able to develop those areas.\"",
      "For Skinner, there is at least the assurance he has another season to try and turn things around. But for United's decision makers, time is running out to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester and the club need to show they have learnt from their mistakes before it is too late.",

      "How every Premier League team could strengthen this summer based on stats; the 2024 Premier League summer transfer window opened on June 14; the window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.",
      "Friday 14 June 2024 10:25, UK",
      "The summer transfer window is open but what does every Premier League team need? Sky Sports statistician Paul Harrison dives into the data to find out...",
      "Few flaws can be found in a team who have finished runners-up to Manchester City in successive seasons. However not a single Arsenal player has surpassed 16 Premier League goals in four campaigns.",
      "This season, Kai Havertz's return of nine goals in his final 14 league appearances this season was promising, but Eddie Nketiah and Gabriel Jesus failed to reach double figures between them from a combined 54 league appearances, with neither finding the net after January.",
      "Aston Villa will compete in Europe's elite competition next season for the first time since 1982/83 when they were reigning European champions.",
      "Their defensive record will surely need improvement to reach such heights again. They started and ended the season conceding five goals at Newcastle and Crystal Palace, while no team has conceded more Premier League goals when qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Only Norwich - who finished third in the inaugural Premier League campaign - have ever finished in the top four and conceded more goals.",
      "Bournemouth won a club-record 48 Premier League points this season. After a slow start under Andoni Iraola, the Cherries took 42 points from their final 27 league games - a total bettered only by the top four and Chelsea.",
      "Next season's success could depend on retaining top scorer Dominic Solanke as much as any potential incomings. The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward featured in all 38 league games this season - the only Bournemouth player to do so.",
      "Not only were his 19 league goals more than twice as many as any team-mate, but, without them, Bournemouth would have finished 17th in the table - only six points clear of relegation.",
      "This season was Brentford's lowest finish (16th) and points total of their three Premier League campaigns (39) - they won just five of their final 24 league games.",
      "For the first half of the season, they caught a glimpse of life without talisman Ivan Toney - something likely to become a permanent feature this summer with only one year left on his contract.",
      "Thomas Frank has acted fast with the signing of Brazilian striker Igor Thiago being confirmed in February. Only Kevin Denkey scored more league goals in Belgium's top tier this season than Thiago, whose conversion rate was nearly three times that of his potential predecessor.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's departure maintains the club's customary seasonal churn within its ranks.",
      "Over the past two years, Brighton have seen key players Marc Cucurella, Yves Bissouma, Leandro Trossard, Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo depart for significant fees, with Graham Potter following suit in September 2022.",
      "The constant changes have been reflected on the pitch: they made 36 more changes to their starting XI than any other team in the division - only one behind the Premier League record.",
      "Stability and consistency next season could be as important as any new signing. The Seagulls are close to finalising a deal to appoint 31-year-old St Pauli boss Fabian Hurzeler as their new head coach, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Chelsea showed signs of progress in the final three months - losing only one of their final 15 league games - but their young squad would benefit from an injection of experience if the top four is a realistic aim.",
      "Thiago Silva, now 39 years of age, followed Mauricio Pochettino out of the club at the end of June. The Blues had the youngest average starting XI in the division this season - despite the Brazilian starting 27 games. Replacing him will be key: they conceded eight more goals than any previous Premier League campaign.",
      "Crystal Palace had lost 10 of their previous 17 league games when Oliver Glasner was appointed in February. Following his first game in charge, only Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea won more points.",
      "This transformation was primarily due to the remarkable form of Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who scored a combined 23 league goals in 13 games under the Austrian.",
      "Keeping hold of their attacking trio - and keeping Olise fit - could be the Eagles' best business this summer.",
      "Without the eight-point deduction, Sean Dyche's team would have finished within touching distance of the top half - winning four of their final six league games.",
      "However, their reliance on set-piece goals will need addressing if a fourth successive relegation dogfight is to be avoided.",
      "The Toffees scored five fewer open-play goals than rock-bottom Sheffield United and easing the burden on Dwight McNeil as their only natural, creative outlet should be a priority.",
      "Fulham's hopes of European football disappeared with just two wins in their final nine Premier League games. The Cottagers' late-season slump could be attributed to having the oldest starting XI in the division and using the joint-fewest number of players.",
      "Some younger legs and depth would not go amiss if Fulham were to push for a return to the top half next season.",
      "Successive promotions from League One to the Premier League means expectations at Portman Road are likely to be realistic next season: only six members of their current squad have played previously in England's top tier.",
      "A key issue for Luton this season was the lack of experience at this level, something Kieran McKenna would be wise to address this summer.",
      "The Foxes' surprise relegation in 2022/23 was primarily due to their defensive issues. At the other end of the pitch, their 51 league goals matched seventh-placed Aston Villa.",
      "However, their top two scorers that season - Harvey Barnes and James Maddison - departed last summer and the third top scorer, Kelechi Iheanacho, is out of contract this summer.",
      "The burden will be on Jamie Vardy, but, at 37, and after struggling in the Premier League last time out, a guaranteed goalscorer seems a must as Leicester boasted the best defence in the Championship this season.",
      "A summer rebuild was already touted at Anfield before Jurgen Klopp's departure after a trophy-laden eight years at Liverpool.",
      "After a midfield shake-up last summer, the focus is likely to be on defensive reinforcement: Virgil van Dijk's future remains uncertain, Joel Matip's contract has expired, Trent Alexander-Arnold is entering the final 12 months of his current deal and Andy Robertson's injury issues remain a concern.",
      "Their defensive stats this season are noticeably worse than in recent years.",
      "After winning an unprecedented fourth successive top-flight English league title, Manchester City will be hard-pressed to find any major flaws ahead of the summer.",
      "With Kalvin Phillips expected to depart after two underwhelming seasons, a deputy for the influential Rodri could be a priority: all three of City's league defeats came when the Spaniard was suspended this season.",
      "Manchester United's inevitable summer of upheaval could see additions in all areas of the pitch - they have struggled both defensively and offensively.",
      "The departure of the experienced Raphael Varane will leave the club light at the back, especially with Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw's ongoing injury concerns.",
      "They used 14 different centre-back partnerships this season and veteran Jonny Evans clocked more league appearances than any other centre-back at the club. So, a keen eye will be cast over a defence that conceded a Premier League club-record 58 goals this term.",
      "Balancing expectations and Europe was always going to be a challenge for Eddie Howe's side this season. They conceded nearly twice as many league goals this campaign (62) compared to 2022/23 (33), when they had the joint-best defence in the division.",
      "Both full-back positions have been problematic of late and freshening up the backline seems likely - especially if they can retain the services of Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak. The Magpies were among the first out of the traps this summer, signing Bournemouth centre-back Lloyd Kelly on a free transfer.",
      "Nuno Santo Espirito's impressive defensive record at Wolves helped persuade Nottingham Forest to appoint him mid-season after axing Steve Cooper. He appeared unconvinced about his goalkeeper options and signed Matz Sels in January.",
      "The Belgian has struggled since joining Forest, with only team-mate Odysseas Vlachodimos and Brighton's Jason Steele registering lower save ratios this season.",
      "A consistent presence between the sticks would help complement an attack that began to gel on the home stretch.",
      "Southampton failed to score in only five Championship games this season - the best record in the division.",
      "The Saints often depended on their potent attack to bail out a defence that ranked midtable for goals conceded and clean sheets. Experience and quality at the back are imperative to avoid a second relegation in three seasons.",
      "Another false dawn at Tottenham, who were top of the table and unbeaten after 10 Premier League games under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Their capitulation in the 4-1 home defeat against Chelsea in November became the norm as the season progressed. Their defensive stats in the final 28 games resembled a team in a relegation battle.",
      "Better midfield protection and competent defensive depth are required - if they are to stand any chance of fighting for a top-four finish next term.",
      "With Lucas Paqueta potentially facing a multi-year ban for alleged breaches of betting rules, replacing the Brazil international's creative qualities would be essential.",
      "Paqueta made six times as many through-balls as any team-mate this season and was comfortably their most potent creator from open play.",
      "Only the three relegated teams conceded more goals than West Ham this term, and Paqueta's skillset was one of the key factors behind their ninth-placed finish.",
      "The Hammers have already snapped up a potential creator in 18-year-old winger Luis Guilherme, signed from Palmeiras for £25m.",
      "A steady but unspectacular debut season for Gary O'Neil ended in disappointment: his team won just one of their final 10 league games.",
      "Goals were rarely an issue for a team boasting the talents of Pedro Neto, Matheus Cunha and Hee-Chan Hwang, but a defence that kept just one clean sheet in their final 17 games will need work if they are to arrest their poor form when the new season arrives.",
      "Wolves have already signed versatile Braga right-back Rodrigo Gomes, who can play as a wing-back or winger, in a £12.7m deal.",
      "The 2024 summer transfer window in Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.",
      "The window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.",
      "The Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe. The closing dates were set following discussions with the leagues in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France."

      "Sky Sports News understands there could be up to 13 clubs in the market for a centre-forward this summer; Sky Sports takes a look at 15 of the best options with Joshua Zirkzee, Victor Osimhen and Jonathan David - linked with a transfer to the Premier League - among those assessed",
      "Friday 14 June 2024 06:20, UK",
      "Strikers are expected to be in high-demand this summer, with Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Man Utd and Tottenham all on the lookout.",
      "Sky Sports News understands there could be up to 13 clubs in the market for a centre-forward this summer.",
      "Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton, West Ham and Wolves are also considering varying profiles of strikers.",
      "Some clubs have already got theirs, such as Brentford and their £30m January signing Igor Thiago, while we have seen one Premier League target - Benjamin Sesko - decide to stay at his club RB Leipzig already. The window opens on Friday.",
      "In the coming market, there appears to be a few tiers to what is on offer at centre-forward, depending on their quality and market value; from the top strikers in the world such as Victor Osimhen - worth at least £100m to Napoli - to potential bargains such as Serhou Guirassy, who has a release clause of little more than £15m.",
      "Here, Sky Sports takes a look at 15 of the best strikers out there in 2024 - some very much available, others near-impossible to get - and uses Wyscout data to showcase their potential for the Premier League.",
      "Club: StuttgartAge: 28Approximate market value: £15.6m (€18.5m) release clauseContract expires: 2026",
      "Every team in the Premier League watched Guirassy last season as he spearheaded Stuttgart's successful league campaign, which saw them earn Champions League qualification.",
      "Sky Sports News mentioned him with the likes of Manchester United, West Ham, Fulham and Nottingham Forest during the January transfer window - but he stayed and finished the season on 28 goals in 28 Bundesliga games, the second-most in Europe's top-five leagues behind only Harry Kane.",
      "Inevitably, the Guinea international is on the list again at every club this summer, mainly due to his relatively cheap release clause, which leaves Stuttgart very exposed to losing him.",
      "However, Champions League football helps them in their bid to keep him, at least from clubs outside European competition next term, although some of the interested clubs could blow them out of the water on wages, especially in England.",
      "In a Bundesliga with a number of top strikers, Guirassy ranks third behind only Kane and Lois Openda in Wyscout's ranking system, which incorporates all of a player's data over the course of a season. He has got a lot about him; great movement, good feet, and knows where the goal is.",
      "Club: Cercle BruggeAge: 23Approximate market value: £16.9m (€20m+)Contract expires: 2026",
      "Belgium is usually a cheaper market for Premier League clubs to shop in and has an increasing number of exciting young players, Denkey being one who is banging in goals in the Jupiler League for fun.",
      "There is yet to emerge a firm Premier League suitor for him, but he is undoubtedly one that the majority of clubs have been watching considering his strong data set. According to Wyscout's rankings, he is the best striker in Belgium currently.",
      "He is also the fourth top-scorer with 31 goals and has the second-best xG rating (35.04) of all the strikers in this list. He is also second on this list for shots per 90 (3.52). He has speed and power going for him.",
      "Club: LilleAge: 24Approximate market value: £34m-£42m (€40m-€50m)Contract expires: 2025",
      "With just a year left on his contract, Jonathan David is another seemingly affordable option for a Premier League club, and a good one after his exploits in the French league over the last few seasons.",
      "He was behind only Kylian Mbappe for goals and assists among centre forwards in France last season, with 19 and four respectively. In 2022-23 season, he was top of the combined xG and xA metric for any striker across the top-five leagues, according to Wyscout's data.",
      "This season, David has the second-best xG (30.15) of the strikers in this list, hits more than half of his shots on target in all competitions and, again in Europe's top-five leagues, David was second only to Jean Philippe-Mateta in terms of shot accuracy, with 60.5 per cent of his Ligue 1 shots hitting the mark.",
      "France's leading newspaper L'Equipe seem to be aware of the Premier League interest and have also mentioned Atletico Madrid. Further reports say Lille want €50m but with only a year left on his contract that seems optimistic.",
      "Club: BolognaAge: 23Approximate market value: £34m (€40m) release clauseContract expires: 2026",
      "Just called up to the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024, Manchester United and Arsenal are currently very interested in Zirkzee as AC Milan push to try and sign him from Serie A rivals Bologna.",
      "Milan are confident of getting a deal done but almost a week has gone by since talks intensified and it is not there yet, which has seen United and Arsenal monitor things more closely this week. Bologna, meanwhile, really want him to stay for another year and are even willing to increase his wages.",
      "Zirkzee stepped-up last season with 11 goals to help Bologna qualify for the Champions League.",
      "He is a really attractive prospect on the market, because of his dynamic profile and relatively young age, with plenty of room for improvement, especially for a relatively modest fee. Juventus also like him a lot but need to sell a striker before they can go after another one.",
      "Club: GironaAge: 26Approximate market value: £34m+ (€40m+)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Ukraine international Dovbyk scored 24 goals in 36 LaLiga games last season as Girona - Manchester City's sister club - finished in the Champions League places.",
      "AC Milan have him on their list if the Zirkzee deal collapses, according to Sky in Italy, while reports in Spain have linked him with Atletico Madrid and Napoli. He is unlikely to be a player for City and their owners are unlikely to want to see him strengthen their rivals, so perhaps a move to the Premier League is unlikely.",
      "Astoundingly, Dovbyk has the third-highest xG (23.87) in top-five leagues behind Haaland (29.04) and Kane (23.9), according to Wyscout data. He is a top attacker, no doubt.",
      "Club: Aston VillaAge: 20Approximate market value: UnknownContract expiry: 2028",
      "Chelsea have been interested in Jhon Duran since January and he remains on their list of strikers as they re-work the squad for new manager Enzo Maresca.",
      "He has played second fiddle to Ollie Watkins since his £18m arrival from Chicago Fire in 2022, but that is to be expected given Watkins' outstanding form. Duran has nonetheless shown what he is capable of when he is on the pitch, scoring five goals mostly as a substitute. Some of those have been absolute spectacular, though.",
      "Duran is undoubtedly a top up and coming striker who needs to player regularly to realise his potential and, given Watkins' status at the club, that may have to be away from Villa Park.",
      "His value has risen and he has a lot of time left on his contract but Duran's price cannot have increased that much given his lack of playing time and recent move to England.",
      "Club: Bayer LeverkusenAge: 23Approximate market value: £42m+ (€50m+)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "The Nigeria goalscorer scored 19 goals as Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen won the Bundesliga. He would have scored more had he not missed a portion of the season through injury.",
      "His valuation has therefore increased and, following Alonso's decision to stay, it will be harder to prize players from his team. Leverkusen have a real chance to solidify their place at the top of the Bundesliga and go further in the Champions League next season.",
      "Boniface has the best xG per 90 (0.71) of any player in this list, above Viktor Gyokeres (0.67) and Jonathan David (0.65), and the second-most shots per 90 (4.05) in Europe's top-five leagues behind Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Club: FeyenoordAge: 23Approximate market value: £42m-£50m (€50m-€60m)Contract expiry: 2027",
      "The Mexican had a sterling season in the Eredivisie under Arne Slot, whose move to Liverpool has raised inevitable speculation that the striker could follow him to Anfield.",
      "Gimenez was also spotted watching a Tottenham game this season and they are among the Premier League clubs who are on the lookout for a young striker they can develop.",
      "He is highly rated by scouts and sporting directors at a number of Premier League clubs and his relative affordability makes him a likely proposition to come to England. However, the record that precedes him for players making the jump from the Eredivisie to the Premier League is not a great one and does create reservations among scouts.",
      "Gimenez's xG is good at 26.39 but he did not provided many assists over the past season. He very much leads the line, plays on the shoulder of the last defender and is devilish in the box, even with his head.",
      "Club: BournemouthAge: 26Approximate market value: £65m release clauseContract expiry: 2027",
      "Dominic Solanke is understood to have a release clause that can be activated by only the 'big six' clubs, reportedly to the tune of £65m.",
      "Andoni Iraola has helped develop him into a prolific Premier League goalscorer and that is what is attracting top clubs to his name again after it did not work out for him at Chelsea and Liverpool earlier in his career.",
      "Inevitable speculation has been made linking him to Eddie Howe at Newcastle, given they worked together at Bournemouth, but Alexander Isak is clearly the first choice there. The top clubs looking at strikers appear to be after someone younger than 26 but if they do not get their first choices, could Solanke come into their sights?",
      "According to Wyscout's index based on performance data, Solanke was the fourth best-performing centre-forward in the Premier League last season, behind Ollie Watkins, Heung-Min Son and Jarrod Bowen. That's quite something.",
      "Club: BrentfordAge: 28Approximate market value: In the region of £70mContract expiry: 2025",
      "If not for his ban from football last season, Ivan Toney would undoubtedly already be at a top club. He was the coveted centre-forward, newly in the England setup, and of interest to Arsenal and Chelsea last year, but instead spent most of last season on the sidelines and was not quite the same player after he returned.",
      "Sky Sports News understands Arsenal have turned their attentions away from Toney and Isak and towards a younger profile of striker they can develop, and Chelsea too seem to be looking at younger players like Duran.",
      "In January, Toney's valuation at Brentford was £100m and that has dropped somewhat, as he enters the final year of his contract at the West London club, and if he has an impactful Euros with England, interest will inevitably pick back up. He needs to show his best again.",
      "Brentford have been preparing themselves to lose Toney this summer, signing £30m striker Igor Thiago from Club Brugge in Belgium, but they will not let Toney go on the cheap.",
      "Club: RB LeipzigAge: 24Approximate market value: £67.6m-£75m (€80m-€88m)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Although Openda's £67.6m (€80m) release clause is not effective until 2025, it does give a guide as to his valuation. Why wouldn't Leipzig argue he is worth that much now given the season he has had?",
      "Twenty-four goals in 34 appearances in the Bundesliga and four in the Champions League has seen him form a formidable partnership with Benjamin Sesko, in a very exciting RB Leipzig team that has finished in the Champions League places in a very competitive division.",
      "Openda is up there among the best performers for xG (22.98), goals-per90 (0.67), and shots per90 (3.37) - and he has, of course, been linked with all the top Premier League clubs over the last 12 months or so.",
      "Club: NapoliAge: 25Approximate market value: £100m+ (€120m+)Contract expiry: 2026",
      "Only a handful of clubs in the world can afford to spend £100m on one player, which limits the market for players such as Victor Osimhen. With two years left on his contract, a move is more practical but Napoli will not let him go for less than his value.",
      "That is surely a reason why the prolific goalscorer is still at Napoli despite speculation that he would move elsewhere nearly every season.",
      "Every top club has been linked with him at one stage or another, including Chelsea, but at such a high price, there are only a handful of clubs worldwide that could spend that kind of money - and most have their centre-forwards.",
      "Reports earlier this year claimed he was high on PSG's wishlist to replace Mbappe, but Antonio Conte will be hoping he sticks around for his first season in charge at Napoli.",
      "Club: Sporting CPAge: 26Approximate market value: £84m (€100m+) release clauseContract expiry: 2028",
      "The Sweden striker only signed for Sporting last summer from Coventry and is thought to have had a €100m release clause inserted into his contract.",
      "He has found the step from Championship to the Portuguese top-flight and European competition a relative breeze, scoring 29 in 33 league games and five more in the Europa League, which is what has alerted clubs to want to bring him back to England.",
      "It will be an expensive job though and only one or two clubs could afford to do it, making it unlikely, especially given the current PSR rules.",
      "Gyokeres' stats are really strong; he has the best xG (36.94) and xAssist (8.8) of any strikers in this list over the course of last season, according to Wyscout data.",
      "Club: NewcastleAge: 24Approximate market value: £100m+Contract expiry: 2028",
      "There is no sign that Newcastle would consider selling their star striker - only speculation that he is of interest to top clubs, which is inevitable given his record and performances last season.",
      "Again, only a handful of clubs in the world could afford Isak and the market is just not fluid enough at the moment for a credible bid to appear on the horizon.",
      "According to Wyscout data, Isak has the best goal conversion rate (28.9 per cent) of any of the strikers in this list.",
      "Club: Aston VillaAge: 28Approximate market value: £100m+Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Again, Watkins is another player nigh-on untouchable at his club unless for a stratospheric bid, and those buyers are just not out there at the moment.",
      "Watkins is central to Aston Villa's push to join the elite clubs and he has been superb under Unai Emery last season, scoring 27 times in all competitions. Villa are also in the Champions League now, so the list of reasons to go elsewhere is shrunk.",
      "According to Wyscout's index based on performance data, Watkins was the best-performing centre-forward in the Premier League last season."

      "Thursday 13 June 2024 09:22, UK",
      "Erik Ten Hag is set to stay at Manchester United after the club finalised their end-of-season review. But what happens now?",
      "United finished a disappointing eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, and despite beating rivals Manchester City to lift the FA Cup and Ten Hag's second trophy in as many years, speculation was still rife over the Dutchman's future after INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe took over the club's football operations in February.",
      "But United have now confirmed that Ten Hag will be staying on as their manager and the 54-year-old is now in talks with the club over an improved contract.",
      "To explain how United came to this decision, Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol goes through all the details.",
      "Solhekol: Ten Hag was aware that it was touch and go as to whether he kept his job or not.",
      "Man Utd had their post-season review and they did explore all options. Ten Hag won the FA Cup at the end of the season, against the backdrop of lots of reports that he was going to lose his job. No sooner are the celebrations over after losing the FA Cup, United are contacting other managers - either directly or through their representatives.",
      "It has obviously been well-documented that they looked at other managers like Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Frank.",
      "There were widespread reports in the UK and Germany that Tuchel met Sir Jim Ratcliffe in Monaco last week. We know there has been contact with representatives of Pochettino. Hiring Gareth Southgate is impossible as he is managing England at the Euros.",
      "United were exploring all eventualities, but ultimately, they decided they would stick with Ten Hag.",
      "Although it can't have been a particularly nice experience for Ten Hag to have had this after winning the FA Cup, he's been in football a long time and knows how these things work.",
      "Solhekol: United were very clear that they were having a post-season review and that the review was going to look at the manager's position.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS came in, they invested in the business and it was their right to look at all areas of the business.",
      "Ten Hag was someone they inherited as a manager and you could argue they were doing what every owner would do when coming into a club by looking at all facets of the business.",
      "Solhekol: You can certainly make the case that if Man Utd hadn't won the FA Cup then Ten Hag would have lost his job.",
      "But you can also make the case that if it wasn't for Haji Wright being offside in the semi-final against Coventry, he also would have lost his job.",
      "It's a game of fine margins but in a post-season review, having the FA Cup and European football from that, it makes a decent case for him to stay. Without those things it's a difficult case to make for him to stay in the job.",
      "Solhekol: INEOS have been impressed with the way Ten Hag has handled the development of Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "INEOS do now want to go in a different direction at Man Utd and the days of spending £80m on one player is over.",
      "They want to sign young players and Ten Hag has proven that he is the right man for those players.",
      "That is definitely one of the reasons why they have stuck with him.",
      "Solhekol: The complication is he's only got one year left on his contract. When you're a manager of the stature of Erik ten Hag, someone who has had a lot of success in the game, you need more security than that. He will want more certainty going forward.",
      "This summer, if he had left United, he could have managed Ajax again and he could have managed Bayern Munich. If he had done that, he would have got the security of a three or four-year contract.",
      "It doesn't help Man Utd or Ten Hag if you are going into a new season with the clock ticking on the manager's future. You want to avoid any more speculation about his future. If there's no new deal, United are just kicking the managerial decision down the road.",
      "It's not good enough for United to have a review and say 'we've explored all eventualities and you'll do for the time being'. Ten Hag deserves more than that. He needs to be backed fully.",
      "That means giving him a contract and the security of a three or four-year deal and that will send a message out to the fans, to the wider community and to the United squad that Ten Hag is here to stay, he's the owners' man and he is the one who calls the shots.",
      "It's also an important decision for transfers at Man Utd. Players coming in will want to know what's going on and they will want security that a manager will not just be off after only a few months of the season.",
      "Solhekol: If he gets his new deal, Ten Hag will have no excuses. Because Sir Jim Ratcliffe will say he is now calling the shots in the club's football operations.",
      "With a new chief executive, a new sporting director and a new technical director, everything is in place for Ten Hag to be successful. No excuses.",
      "Obviously, United still need to work on their training ground and do up Old Trafford as well. But plans are in place to do that.",
      "INEOS are now committed to this project.",
      "Ten Hag has been true to his word. He's said all along he's had a good working relationship with INEOS and now we are getting a clear indication that they want to work with him long-term as well.",
      "The only issue has been the way this has been conducted. There will be people who say that if INEOS loved Ten Hag so much, why were they talking to other managers? However, in this day and age, it might not be the right thing to do to speak to other managers in football terms, but it is the right thing to do in business.",
      "INEOS have come in and made a lot of changes already at Man Utd and there will be more, but they think Ten Hag is the right man to coach the team. But I do not think he is as powerful as he was before INEOS arrived.",
      "Ten Hag will be happy that he is keeping his job, but I don't think it is a massive cause for celebration for him because I'm sure he thinks it should have been dealt with much quicker and that his position wouldn't have been under so much scrutiny for so long.",
      "Solhekol: It is a massive summer for Man Utd.",
      "It's not just about players coming in either. It's also about players going out the door.",
      "Ten Hag has said he wants another centre-back, he wants another central midfielder and he wants another striker.",
      "There's also the Jadon Sancho situation which has to be dealt with. You'd think that with Ten Hag staying it makes it much more likely that Sancho will leave Old Trafford, unless there's some sort of twist and peace talks with everybody making up.",
      "But in terms of transfers, I don't think Ten Hag will have the sort of control and influence that he previously had because of the new structure that has been put in place at United.",
      "There's also still a lot of uncertainty around the club with new chief executive Omar Berrada not starting yet, Dan Ashworth is embroiled in a legal dispute with Newcastle United and the transfer window will be open on Friday.",
      "It is good news for United that they have Jason Wilcox in place and, now they know Ten Hag will be the manager, it will help them in the market."

      "Man Utd conclude review of the season and decide to keep Erik ten Hag, with negotiations over a contract extension said to be under way; Ten Hag's FA Cup triumph and squads injury issues understood to have been considered in review, which saw Gareth Southgate and others sounded out for job",
      "Wednesday 12 June 2024 15:58, UK",
      "Erik ten Hag will stay on as Manchester United manager.",
      "United and Ten Hag are said to be aligned after the club's end-of-season review, a process which lasted longer than two weeks and saw other managers sounded out for the role.",
      "However, the conclusion from the review was that Ten Hag should remain in charge, and negotiations have begun over a contract extension for the Dutchman.",
      "Ten Hag's current contract ends at the end of next season, with the club having the option of extending it by a further 12 months.",
      "United finished a disappointing eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, but beat rivals Manchester City to lift the FA Cup - Ten Hag's second trophy in as many years.",
      "Speaking in May, Ten Hag said:\n\n\n\"The team is progressing, and we are winning trophies. Two trophies in two years is not bad. Three finals is not bad, but we have to keep going. I'm not satisfied with it.\n\n\n\"We have to do better and if they don't want me anymore, then I'll go anywhere else to win trophies because that is what I have done my whole career.\"",
      "Ten Hag had to contend with an injury-ravaged squad throughout the season but managed to salvage Europa League qualification with the victory over City at Wembley.",
      "The review concluded that Ten Hag deserves a chance to show what more he is capable of within the new sporting structure implemented following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS taking charge of football operations.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel, Thomas Frank, Kieran McKenna and Gareth Southgate were all linked with taking over at Old Trafford but the club have now committed to Ten Hag.",
      "Tuchel, Southgate and McKenna were sounded out during the review, which is said to have been more thorough than usual because of the new ownership structure. The process is expected to be similar in future.",
      "Ratcliffe's INEOS has taken control of the club's footballing operations since becoming a minority shareholder in February and has overseen major staff changes.",
      "Jason Wilcox has begun work as technical director, while Omar Berrada will start as the new chief executive this summer.",
      "United's review recognised the significant achievement of winning two trophies in two seasons - particularly the quality of the FA Cup win against City.",
      "Ten Hag's dedication is said to be admired by decision-makers at United, as well as the dignity and professionalism with which he has conducted himself.",
      "The emergence of academy products Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo under Ten Hag and his work developing them were among the other factors considered by United.",
      "The review also took into account mitigating factors - not least the injuries Ten Hag's players have suffered and the number of problems concentrated in key positions.",
      "United also believe new signings, notably Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana, need time to bed in, while Mason Mount spent most of last season sidelined through injury.",
      "Sky Sports News reporter Dharmesh Sheth:",
      "\"Remember, he did maintain through all of his talks with Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he believed he would be the man to lead Manchester United forward, that he was under contract until next summer at least and he had no reason to believe he wasn't going to be the manager.",
      "\"Manchester United have been conducting their post-season review after that FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "\"After that review of the last season and first-team operations, the club and Erik ten Hag held constructive discussions about what happened over the past season and what could happen in the future.",
      "\"Manchester United considered all eventualities. They did speak to other managers and representatives of other managers - Thomas Tuchel, Kieran McKenna and Mauricio Pochettino. But the conclusion after that review and all of those talks was that Ten Hag would remain as manager.",
      "\"The club and Ten Hag are believed to be aligned and have now entered negotiations over a contract extension. This is really significant. He's got one year left on his contract.\"",
      "Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:",
      "\"It's a pleasant surprise for Erik ten Hag, he always knew it was touch and go whether he was going to keep his job at Old Trafford. He has been on holiday in Spain waiting patiently for contact from United, and they did contact him and told him the review was over and they wanted to stick with him.",
      "\"The complication is he's only got one year left on his contract. When you're a manager of the stature of Erik ten Hag, you need more security than that. This summer, if he had left United, he could have managed Ajax again and he could have managed Bayern Munich. If he had done that, he would have got the security of a three or four-year contract.",

      "Manchester United's FA Cup success has helped to save Erik ten Hag's job, but he now has to turn things around after the club's worst Premier League finish since Sir Alex Ferguson retired; here Sky Sports takes a look at last season's issues and the reasons for optimism under Ten Hag",
      "Wednesday 12 June 2024 17:05, UK",
      "Manchester United are sticking with Erik ten Hag, but the alarming numbers from the past season show he has his work cut out for him.",
      "United ended the campaign eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, after Ten Hag failed to curb the team's worrying performances amid an almost constant injury crisis.",
      "Their unlikely win over Manchester City in the FA Cup final was the only saving grace, and perhaps what kept Ten Hag from being sacked, as his team saved their best until last. Helped, importantly, by key players returning from injury.",
      "Seventy per cent of you voted that this had been United's worst season since Sir Alex Ferguson retired when asked with four games to go. The outlook, of course, has changed a lot since then.",
      "Rightly so, an FA Cup trophy and Europa League qualification after a season with so many issues is admirable. Ten Hag has now won two trophies in as many seasons, none of Ferguson's successors can boast a better return.",
      "He and Jose Mourinho are the most successful United managers of the past decade.",
      "Scenes of jubilation at Wembley have somewhat pushed the memories from the rest of United's season to the back of our thinking, however. Ten Hag is yet to find anywhere near the consistency required to make this an elite side.",
      "That is reflected in the 31-point gap between themselves and champions Manchester City in the table.",
      "Arsenal were only two points from finishing above City, but in some quarters the question of whether United have enjoyed a better season has been raised because of their cup success.",
      "That argument only has legs if Mikel Arteta's side never go on to achieve more, though. Arsenal have built a team capable of pushing the Premier League's most successful side all the way. United can't dream of that right now.",
      "Replicating a rise akin to that of Arsenal is the end goal for INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has set an optimistic timeline of three years to knock City off their perch.",
      "That will take some going considering United rode their luck this season, according to the data.",
      "The table based on xG has them finishing in 14th, six places lower than they actually did, with a paltry 40 points, often the target for teams hoping to avoid relegation. Things could've been a lot worse.",
      "Across Europe's top five leagues, with 96 teams competing, only Sheffield United - relegated to the Championship with 16 points and 104 goals shipped - conceded more shots than Manchester United over the whole season.",
      "Ten Hag puts this down to the injuries he has had to contend with, particularly in defence. Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, the left side of a solid United defence last season, were more absent than present.",
      "The volume of injuries, no side in the league had more injuries resulting in a player missing one or more games (Premier Injuries), also prevented United from finding any consistency when Ten Hag was forced to make alterations.",
      "United used 15 different centre-back pairings this season, closing the campaign with Casemiro at the heart of defence for the final six league games. He had three separate centre-back partners in that time.",
      "There were signs of Casemiro finding his feet at centre-back by the end, although it was his performances in midfield that drew most criticism. Ten Hag's set-up didn't help the 31-year-old.",
      "The chasm so often seen between United's midfield and defence was alarming. A high press with a low block? \"They defend like no team I've seen before,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher in a scathing assessment in February on Monday Night Football.",
      "Casemiro's time could be up at the top level and a transfer this summer has been widely mooted. On-loan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat appears unlikely to remain, either. Finding a more suitable defensive midfielder will be crucial.",
      "United need a player who can also bring control after recording their lowest average possession for a season since records began.",
      "Ten Hag defended the way his side were set up when they conceded 31 shots in a 1-1 draw at Brentford, a game United were very fortunate not to lose. \"We concede shots, but we don't concede so many goals\", he said.",
      "True on that occasion, but not an accurate reflection of the whole season. United have never conceded so many goals in a Premier League season. The 58 goals let in this season surpasses the year when the wheels came off for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22.",
      "Unsurprisingly, a team that ships so many goals tends to lose quite often. Ten Hag lost more games this season than any other United manager has in the Premier League era.",
      "They lost 14 times in the league, twice more than in 2021/22. Going further back, this is United's most league defeats since 1989/90, when they lost 16 times under Ferguson.",
      "It has been the nature of certain defeats which has made the season particularly painful for United. They've lost by two or more goals on nine occasions across all competitions.",
      "Results such as the 4-0 thrashing at Crystal Palace and being comfortably beaten 3-0 at home by Bournemouth paint a picture of a side that has the propensity to crumble.",
      "Ten Hag kept his job in part because of his work developing academy products Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho. The two teenagers being the match-winners in the game that may have saved his job was apt.",
      "Garnacho's opener was the first goal a teenager had scored in an FA Cup final since 2004. That was Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall. Sir Matt Busby's, 'If you're good enough, you're old', philosophy endures at United under Ten Hag.",
      "The manager's faith in youth was perhaps one of the most powerful arguments for staying on. It would've felt like a case of unfinished business had he been let go.",
      "On top of Mainoo and Garnacho, there are a raft of promising young players coming through the academy and Ten Hag is not afraid to use them.",
      "Ethan Wheatley became the 250th academy player to represent United at senior level earlier this season. He is part of a cohort that just won a domestic treble at U18 level. Financial constraints could open the door for some to make the leap.",
      "United, of course, have had an academy player in every matchday squad since 1937. Under Ten Hag there appears to be no chance of that run, lasting more than 4,000 matches, ending anytime soon.",
      "Add in the likes of Rasmus Hojlund to that equation and Ten Hag is building a young core of players to develop over the next season at the very least.",
      "This injection of enthusiasm has been vital for Ten Hag to instil his high-energy approach - United were pressing more than ever this season.",
      "There have been signs of the out-of-possession work paying off - take Garnacho's goal against City when he forced an error by Josko Gvardiol. The hope is another season with the same ideas brings more consistency.",
      "Ten Hag's first season, which secured a third-place finish and success in the Carabao Cup, provides more room for optimism. For now, he's been given the benefit of the doubt that he can deliver when not dealing with an injury crisis."

      "Erik ten Hag had looked doomed at Manchester United but that FA Cup win over Manchester City at Wembley has changed the mood. Will he be able to build on this belated backing? In The Debrief, Adam Bate takes a look...",
      "Wednesday 12 June 2024 10:27, UK",
      "When Manchester United were crushed 4-0 by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park at the start of May, there had appeared no way back for Erik ten Hag. Even the manager admitted that his team had been “easy to beat” – it felt like the end.",
      "There was some sympathy for the injuries that had robbed him of the opportunity to field his best team and an appreciation that off-field issues had complicated his two years in charge. Still, it did not seem enough to make the case for a third.",
      "And yet, victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final altered that view more than many might have imagined any one game could. United were deserved winners, Ten Hag executing his tactical plan to perfection in confounding Pep Guardiola.",
      "The unexpected triumph meant that he had delivered a trophy in each of his first two seasons, something no United manager had done before, and, just as pertinently, something neither Guardiola nor Jurgen Klopp had managed either.",
      "In doing so, it not only secured European football but, with the goals scored by two teenagers, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, it lent credence to the notion that Ten Hag was building something, that there was cause for optimism after all.",
      "Even his manner seemed to change. After offering so many excuses for the inexcusable, Ten Hag roused the club with his robust words. Essentially, he came out fighting, addressing the supporters on the pitch after the final home game of the season.",
      "\"This season is not over yet,\" he told them. \"First, we go to Brighton, where we travel for three points, and then we go to Wembley. And I promise you those players will give everything to get that cup and bring it to Old Trafford.\" They won both matches.",
      "Emboldened in the aftermath of his FA Cup final victory, Ten Hag almost dared the decision-makers at United to find someone better. \"If they do not want me, I go anywhere else and do what I did my whole career, winning games and trophies.\"",
      "Whether any of this means that the club's new hierarchy have made the right decision in continuing with Ten Hag remains to be seen. While the past month has seen the Dutchman's reputation enhanced, the same cannot be said for their conduct.",
      "Talk of a 'full review' sounded professional in theory but in practice it was an awkward process. The public pursuit of alternative options was messy, those apparently targeted so different in profile that it looked like a scattergun approach.",
      "That the conclusion of their review now looks likely to result in a new contract for the man they had actively considered removing from his job speaks to the paucity of options rather than any great conviction in his work to date. Concerns remain.",
      "What if options improve and results do not? This summer was an opportunity for a fresh start under new leadership. If United begin next season badly that opportunity will have been wasted. They will hardly be able to claim the warning signs were not there.",
      "Ten Hag has much work to do to show that he can address the issues that have arisen on his watch, the extraordinary number of shots conceded being among them. There are those supporters still waiting for a clear style of play to emerge too.",
      "Any kind of continuation of those problems risks this move eventually coming to be seen as wishful thinking rather than a cold analysis of the facts. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his advisers really are invested now. He is no longer just the coach they inherited.",
      "For now, as unlikely as it had once seemed, Ten Hag is their man. After plumbing the depths that night against Palace, it is some comeback already. If this were to prove a turning point as Manchester United rise again, it would be truly remarkable."

      "Kobbie Mainoo's footballing talent is now clear to us all. What the 19-year-old has also proved over the course of this season is his elite sense of timing. A nose for the big occasion.",
      "Calling Mainoo's first Premier League goal a 'late winner' doesn't do it justice. Not when it came in the 97th minute, requiring him to weave past three Wolves players before bending the ball into the bottom corner to snatch a 4-3 victory at Molineux.",
      "Mainoo's first senior goal at Old Trafford was pretty special, too. What better way to announce yourself to your home fans than by whipping a finish into the top corner against Liverpool, your great rivals.",
      "And with United desperate for a shock win over noisy neighbours Manchester City to end a tough season on a high, of course it was Mainoo who stepped up to score the winner at Wembley.",
      "Mainoo is no stranger at the national stadium - he'd already been named player of the match on his first start for England in March.",
      "Still a teenager, Mainoo is already vital to United's future and looks ready to shine for England at this summer's Euros.",
      "But through interviews with those who watched Mainoo's rise, Sky Sports delves into his past to trace a journey that looks set to end at the top.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is Next Up.",
      "Steve Vare, Mainoo's coach at Cheadle and Gatley Junior FC",
      "Nick Cox, Manchester United academy director",
      "\"He is 10 times the player I was at 19\"",
      "Paul Scholes",
      "Most of us had to wait until Mainoo was in his late teens before witnessing his talent. But Steve Vare - who was Mainoo's first coach at Cheadle and Gatley, just south of Manchester - saw it up close.",
      "\"It was apparent from a very early stage that he was an exceptional kid,\" Vare tells Sky Sports. \"It's hard to say when they're so young but you could just tell from the minute he came in.\"",
      "Mainoo grew up in nearby Cheadle Hulme and joined Cheadle and Gatley when he was just four.",
      "\"What struck me was how strong and wiry he was,\" recalls Vare. \"He had a really hard shot on him for such a young kid.",
      "\"He was just really powerful - he'd be scoring goals from everywhere. He could just do things that I've not seen kids of that age do.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "Naturally, it quickly became clear to Vare that Mainoo needed special treatment.",
      "\"I used to have to do a separate warm up for Kobbie because everything else was just too easy,\" he explains.",
      "\"We used to have to say to him, ‘you can only score with your weaker foot’, ‘you can only have two touches of the ball’, or, ‘you can't score, you have to pass to a team-mate'.",
      "\"Never complained. He just loved being challenged.\"",
      "To anyone who witnessed the dramatic winner against Wolves in February, Mainoo's ability to beat several opponents before calmly producing a finish from the edge of the area in the dying minutes of the game may have raised eyebrows. But Vare had seen something similar over a decade previously.",
      "\"He would just dominate and score lots of goals, weaving in and out of players,\" he says.",
      "\"He just used to glide through games.\"",
      "Your browser does not support this video",
      "'He's a Man Utd fan - it was a natural choice'",
      "By the age of six, Mainoo was ready to branch out, with Vare explaining: \"His dad, Felix, and I used to have chats at the end of each session to say 'how can we test him even more?'",
      "\"I got to the point of saying to Felix, ‘Kobbie is ready to play for a professional academy’.\"",
      "That would come in time. But first, Mainoo made the move to Failsworth Dynamos, based north-west of Manchester. Some early adaptation was necessary, recalls Ian Kelly, Mainoo's coach at his new club.",
      "\"He was all tricks, skill, taking people on,\" Kelly told The Athletic earlier this season. \"It took him a bit to learn how to play in a team.\"",
      "Mainoo celebrates winning the 2022 FA Youth Cup with team-mate Rhys Bennett",
      "Mainoo celebrates winning the 2022 FA Youth Cup with team-mate Rhys Bennett",
      "But after a few months, Mainoo was up and running, playing as a forward for Failsworth and continuing to demonstrate the potential he showed at Cheadle and Gatley.",
      "\"I knew it wouldn’t faze him - I could tell when he came to us,\" said Kelly.",
      "Even at the age of six, word of the precocious young talent from Cheadle Hulme had spread around Manchester. It was no surprise that both United and City's attentions were peaked.",
      "Paul Newton, one of Mainoo's coaches at Cheadle and Gatley, also worked for City as a coach and scout for their junior sides and ensured the club were aware of his talent.",
      "Mainoo trained with City's academy - but he'd also been playing with the Man Utd Foundation and was invited to work with their academy by Dermot Clarke, one of United's scouts. Mainoo and his family had a decision to make.",
      "City may have been on the way to winning their first of eight Premier League titles back in 2011, but United had a trump card.",
      "\"He's a Man Utd fan,\" says Vare. \"It was probably a natural choice.\"",

      "'As a youngster, he was a centre forward'",
      "Entering the Manchester United academy, a famous factory of talent that produced the Busby Babes and the Class of '92, is no mean feat.",
      "But of the thousands of kids that spend time at a club of United's size, only a handful will possess the talent, drive and fortune to make it as professional footballers. Even fewer still will progress to the United first team.",
      "That alone speaks to Mainoo's technical and mental qualities - all of which were apparent to Nick Cox, United's academy director.",
      "\"All of our boys are high-potential but you certainly could see that Kobbie had some attributes that meant we wanted to continue working with him,\" he tells Sky Sports.",
      "\"As time unfolded, it became clear he potentially had the ability to go on and play for our first team.",
      "\"On the pitch - even as a little 'un - he was then what he is now. He's mastered the ball - he manipulates it brilliantly.",
      "\"You could tell he had athletic potential and now you see a powerful, explosive player.",
      "\"As a little kid, we were waiting for that to come, but we could sense it was a matter of time.\"",
      "Not that Mainoo had been dominating the midfield from an early age. \"As a youngster, he was a centre-forward and scored a lot of goals,\" revealed Cox.",
      "\"I've seen him play in all sorts of attacking positions. Around the age of 15, 16, he was more of an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "Not that United was Mainoo's only focus. He continued to play for Shots, a grassroots club coached by Paul Newton, who previously worked with Mainoo at Cheadle and Gatley.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may be known all over Europe now but Shots was home to some famous names - Kai Rooney, Jacey Carrick, Ben Aguero, Roman Walker and Tyler and Jack Fletcher have all been through the club.",
      "But Mainoo's ability to make a name for himself was in evidence back in 2017, when he scored the winning goal as Shots claimed the North West Junior Champions League  - a competition Newton said he had been trying to win for a decade.",
      "'He was a little bit too comfortable'",
      "It's not just Mainoo's technical abilities that were immediately obvious to the coaches that helped guide him during his childhood. Time and again, it's Mainoo's calm temperament that those who worked with him remember.",
      "\"One of the things that struck me with Kobbie was, even at that young age, he was very calm, very laid back and soaked everything up,\" says Vare.",
      "\"That's one of his super strengths. He doesn't seem to be phased by anything.\"",
      "Cox tells a similar story, saying: \"Probably his most impressive quality was his character and his personality.",
      "\"Kobbie's always been humble, laid back - maybe even quiet off the pitch.\"",
      "As others fell by the wayside, Mainoo's progress through the age groups at United was smooth and he made his debut in the UEFA Youth League - an U19s tournament - aged just 16.",
      "But the highlight came at Old Trafford in May 2022, when United beat Nottingham Forest 3-1 in the FA Youth Cup final. Alejandro Garnacho scored a brace as United lifted the trophy in front of more than 67,000 fans.",
      "That same month, Mainoo signed a professional contract with United. Eleven years after first training with the club, he was now finally on the verge of the first team.",
      "Yet the cool, calm and composed Mainoo still had some improvements to make in the eyes of Erik ten Hag. The manager felt he was possibly a little too laid back.",
      "\"I think very quickly I saw him,\" explained Ten Hag, who joined United in the summer of 2022.",
      "\"I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable in the U21s. He should be much more dominant.\"",
      "A first-team debut came against Charlton in the Carabao Cup in January 2023, followed by one brief appearance each in the FA Cup and Premier League.",
      "The plan was for Mainoo to be incorporated into Ten Hag's squad for the 2023/24 season - that was until he suffered an ankle injury on United's pre-season tour of the USA that would keep him sidelined well into the campaign.",
      "For the first time, events were conspiring against Mainoo. But his time was coming.",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "'This boy is special'",
      "Mainoo isn't used to being upstaged but, after seeing Garnacho grab the headlines in the FA Youth Cup final two seasons earlier, the Argentina international did it again at Goodison Park last November.",
      "Aged 18, Ten Hag handed Mainoo his first Premier League start against Everton. All eyes were on the academy graduate - at least until the third minute, when Garnacho scored a goal for the ages.",
      "No matter. United won 3-0 and Ten Hag had been convinced by Mainoo. Having never previously started a top-flight game, he was only left out twice for the remainder of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate was convinced, too. Less than five months after his first Premier League start, Mainoo skipped the U21s and made his senior England debut against Brazil - although 17-year-old Endrick snatched the headlines by scoring the winner.",
      "Not to be outdone, Mainoo ensured he was the star act three days later, being named player of the match on his first international start as England drew 2-2 with Belgium in the final camp before the Euros squad was announced. Once again, Mainoo's timing was impeccable.",
      "Less than two weeks later, he scored that goal against Liverpool. Less than two months later, he scored that winner against City - the team he turned down more than a decade ago.",
      "Mainoo's rise is no doubt a source of pride for Cox - who first encountered the local boy when he was just 11 - but it's not just his exploits on the field that have caught his eye.",
      "\"As much as I've been impressed by what he's done on the pitch, I've been really impressed with the way he's dealt with the media and coped with the spotlight,\" says Cox.",
      "\"He's remained cool but expressed the side of him that we've known since he was a little boy.\"",
      "But for United midfielders - especially those emerging from the academy - there can be few greater sources of praise than the player Xavi and Zinedine Zidane agreed was the greatest of their generation.",
      "After witnessing Mainoo's match-winning display in the FA Cup final, Paul Scholes wrote on social media: \"Read a few comparisons between me and this kid last week... don't waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.",
      "\"Just love the way he receives the ball, the calmness, the awareness of what's around him and of course big goals in big games. This boy is special.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is Next Up.",

      "Thursday 6 June 2024 15:35, UK",
      "A man has been found guilty of headbutting Roy Keane at a Premier League match.",
      "Scott Law, 43, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, was accused of assaulting the former Manchester United captain on September 3 last year.",
      "The confrontation took place as Arsenal beat Manchester United 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium, where Keane was working as a pundit.",
      "Footage on social media appeared to show Micah Richards stepping in. Keane said he was left \"in shock\" by the clash.",
      "Law, who pleaded not guilty to a charge of common assault, had told the court Keane told him to \"meet him outside\" after \"banter turned more aggressive\".",
      "The fracas began when Keane and Richards were walking to do the final match analysis after Arsenal's win, the trial at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard.",
      "Keane was then allegedly headbutted through doors at the Emirates by Law, whose defence team said CCTV footage from inside the stadium - shown in court - displayed the pundit elbowing the defendant in the face.",
      "Giving evidence, Keane told the court: \"There was lots of noise and shouting, as you would expect at a football match.",
      "\"I was just walking and, before I knew it, I was hit. I felt the contact and fell back through some doors.",
      "\"I was absolutely not expecting it. The only way I can describe it is that I was in shock. I didn't expect it to happen, not when I was in my workplace.\"",
      "Keane said he suffered bruising on his chest and arms as a result of the incident.",
      "Giving evidence to the court, Richards denied accusations by Law's defence barrister that he had claimed to see the headbutt because he was \"Roy's mate\" and had become his \"puppy\" and \"stooge\".",
      "Richards said he \"grappled\" with Law following the alleged incident, adding he was in \"disbelief\" at what he witnessed.",
      "Richards added: \"I felt sorry for Roy. Just because of the fact you've come to work, to do your job and you've been assaulted.",
      "\"I could see he was physically shaken up. You do what any friend would do, or any colleague - step in and try to help the situation.\"",
      "He added: \"It was a surreal moment. We weren't going to a UFC match. We were at work.\"",
      "Law, who was sat beneath the Sky Sports studio during the match, said Keane was \"angry\" throughout the entire game.",
      "He claimed Keane \"picked me out and started telling me to see him outside\". Then, when Law claimed he went inside the stadium to go to the toilet, he said he encountered the pundit, who \"collided into him\".",
      "Prosecutor Simon Jones KC asked Law: \"Are you seriously saying that Roy Keane ran into the top of your head?\"",
      "Law, who cried while being questioned, said: \"I put my head down in a defensive manner to protect my face.\"",
      "Jones said Law's \"ridiculous\" defence had \"changed dramatically\" from a prepared statement he gave to police the day after the incident.",
      "Asked about the apparent differences in this statement, Law replied: \"I'd had no sleep - I was guilty by media. It was the worst night of my life.\"",
      "Delivering his verdict, District Judge Angus Hamilton said he believed Law had been \"untruthful about what happened\" during the match.",
      "Mr Hamilton continued: \"There was no reason Mr Keane should have picked on him in particular.\" Keane \"was calm and not agitated\" when he left the studio, he added.",
      "The judge said Keane's reputation as the so-called \"hard man of football\" was \"years ago and was confined to the football pitch\".",
      "\"I'm sure Mr Law assaulted Mr Keane,\" concluded the judge.",
      "Law did not react as the verdict was delivered."
