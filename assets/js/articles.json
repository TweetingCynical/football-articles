      "Bryan Mbeumo has been the subject of discussions between Brentford and Tottenham - and the forward is now interested in a move to Spurs. Mbeumo had declared his desire to move to Manchester United earlier this month.",
      "The Red Devils have already seen a bid rejected for the Premier League star who bagged 20 goals in 2024/25. The Bees want a £60million fee for the Cameroon international with talk of United making an improved offer in excess of that figure mounting after their first failure.",
      "But now, the arrival of Thomas Frank at Tottenham as Ange Postecoglou's successor could tempt Mbeumo to change tact. Mbeumo is said to hold be more intrigued by a move across London following the appointment of Frank as head coach.",
      "Newcastle United saw a move for the much-wanted star rejected in January and appear to have not competed for his signature this summer such were Mbeumo's salary demands for United. It was suggested the attacker has been offered a salary that could reach £200,000-a-week.",
      "Mbeumo has a year left on his contract with an option for a further year, leaving the Bees in a healthy position to negotiate for the moment. Brentford have already received £10m from Spurs as compensation for Frank.",
      "The Dane's new side are said to only be willing to foot up £130,000-a-week with additional bonuses. But the draw of Frank and European football could yet prove crucial.",
      "Speaking about Mbeumo's future earlier this summer, Frank suggested top teams should be looking at the player given his successes last term. The 51-year-old also admitted it would only be fair for Brentford to receive a signficant fee.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Really a lot,\" he said. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.\"",
      "He added: \"I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Ruben Amorim knew it was only a matter of time before Viktor Gyokeres took the next step in his career and moved on to bigger and better things.",
      "When he was leaving Sporting Lisbon to take over at Manchester United back in November, Amorim was asked if he intended to take prolific goalscorer Gyokeres with him.",
      "“If I start joking about this Gyokeres situation, I’ll get in trouble,” said Amorim. “This is my city, this is my country, so I’ll respect it. Viktor has to stay until the end of the season and then his life will probably go somewhere else.”",
      "Having seen out last season with Sporting where he plundered a phenomenal haul of 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions, Gyokeres is now ready to move on.",
      "Gyokeres is good friends with fellow goal machine, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, and could soon be rivalling him – and Liverpool's Mo Salah – for the crown of the Premier League's top scorer.",
      "United is the logical destination for him, where he would be reunited with former boss Amorim, but Arsenal are also determined to land the 27-year-old Sweden star.",
      "Gyokeres has enjoyed a meteoric rise, from being let go by Brighton, to a spell at Coventry, then to Sporting and now on the brink of a mega-money move to the Premier League.",
      "It was at Coventry where Gyokeres first came up with his unique goal celebration, one which sees him cross both hands over his mouth, to form a mask.",
      "Debate has raged over the meaning of the celebration, with former Coventry team-mate Josh Eccles suggesting it is a nod to the character Hannibal Lecter in the film Silence of the Lambs. \"He [Hannibal Lecter] eats people and Viktor destroys defences,\" said Eccles.",
      "Others believe the celebration was inspired by the masked villain Bane, from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises. What is certain is that Gyokeres has been feasting on defences in Portugal and all over Europe since joining Sporting and has proved as deadly as Bane and Hannibal Lecter.",
      "A remarkable haul of 97 goals from 102 appearances in two seasons at Sporting has seen Gyokeres become a target for United and Arsenal, who will go head-to-head for him.",
      "Gyokeres served notice of his ability to terrorise Premier League sides in the Champions League last season, with a stunning hat-trick in a 4-1 win for Sporting over Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "As well as averaging more than one goal a game last season, Gyokeres has also scored nine in just six appearances for Sweden, underlining his ability to score at any level.",
      "Those who know Gyokeres well and have worked with him speak of a player with a relentless work ethic, strong mentality, laser focus and a fierce desire to win.",
      "Having just turned 27, Gyokeres is hitting the peak years of his career, which is why United and Arsenal – both crying out for a proven and prolific goalscorer – want to land him.",
      "Having agreed last summer to give Sporting one more season, Gyokeres insists he struck a gentleman's agreement with the club, allowing him to leave for a certain price. Sporting president Frederico Varandas has denied this and is adamant Gyokeres will not be allowed to leave for lower than his release clause of £85million.",
      "Reports from Lisbon suggest Gyokeres is willing to go on strike to get the move he wants, a move dismissed by Varandas and the Sporting hierarchy. What seems likely is that the future of Gyokeres will be a protracted saga over the summer, unless United or Arsenal are willing to meet Sporting's valuation.",
      "On the evidence of his phenomenal form of the last two seasons, Gyokeres would appear to be worth it.",

      "Shaun Wright-Phillips has warned that Manchester United risk alienating their young talents if they opt for a sell-to-buy strategy this summer.",
      "The ex-Manchester City and Chelsea midfielder highlighted the predicament of Alejandro Garnacho, who seems to have fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim. Wright-Phillips also expressed concern over 20-year-old Kobbie Mainoo's situation, as he looks to be struggling to adapt to his manager's system.",
      "Wright-Phillips suggests that academy product Mainoo and Garnacho, who was bought for £420,000, could be seen as valuable assets. The United board appears willing to let the duo leave for a substantial fee in order to alleviate concerns over Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "Marcus Rashford, another homegrown talent, also looks set to bring in a hefty sum for United this summer. With the club facing financial difficulties after a disastrous season that saw them miss out on European football, significant player sales may be needed to boost their transfer funds.",
      "\"I don't think they should be getting rid of key players like that,\" Wright-Phillips told Betway. \"Because the same thing in many ways has happened to Kobbie Mainoo without even saying anything. He's just not been playing either and he was that golden child, as well, about a year ago.",
      "\"It's either that or they're trying to raise money from players they've not had to pay for. Because some of their selling, I'm not really understanding.\"",
      "Garnacho was limited to just 20 minutes in United's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. The 20-year-old now finds himself on the brink of an Old Trafford exit with teams such as Chelsea and Napoli linked with the Argentinian for around £50m-£60m.",
      "The young winger hit out after the humbling loss in Bilbao, branding United's season \"s**t\" and adding that he would wait to see what his future holds. Wright-Phillips believes that Amorim and United have poorly handled Garnacho's situation. \"It's a hard one because I do think he's a fantastic winger,\" Wright-Phillips added.",
      "\"I like wingers that try and take on their defenders, entertain, because that's what I based my game off –entertaining the crowd, trying to make the full-back's life hell. Garnacho does that in multiple ways.",
      "\"He was obviously hurt by the decision not to start him in the final, which, to be honest, I didn't understand either, considering he had started all the other games and played really well in most of them.\"",
      "He continued: \"But before the game, the manager's seen something tactically different – whether it worked or didn't work. When he brings him on, that's when the game changed, and it was more United than Spurs, because he was causing them all sorts of problems.",
      "\"It obviously hurt him deeply, and I think the manager should have just pulled him aside and said, 'Look, I know you were hurt, but you could have just come and said it to me, you didn't have to go public'. But he's gone public. I just think there's a better way for the manager and the club to handle it.\"",

      "The new Premier League season is still some way away, but clubs have been giving their fans plenty to get excited about. For some, that means new signings, but for others the 2025-26 kits are the main talking point.",
      "It has become a habit of some sides to debut new kits at the end of the previous season, while others wait longer. At the time of writing, fewer than half of the 20 teams in England's top tier have shared their new releases, but we'll be updating you throughout the summer as the newest home and away kits drop.",
      "There will often be variety in new kit releases, though this is more likely to come with the change strips than with the home efforts. Traditional colours aren't tampered with quite as regularly - though there are some exceptions.",
      "This time last year, we were starting to see the first of the 2024-25 kits. If you want to refresh your memory, you can look back at our complete ranking of the home and away shirts unveiled by the Premier League's clubs last term.",
      "Those of you who liked last season's efforts might be dreading what's to come, while if you weren't a fan of last year's you might be giving your team a shot at redemption this summer. Without further ado, here are the kits which have been released so far.",
      "Arsenal released their new home kit before the end of the 2024-25 season, allowing their players to wear it for the home Premier League closer against Newcastle. The adidas shirt is red with white shoulders and a red trim, and puts a gothic letter 'A' on the badge at the forefront in a nod to the 1990-91 title winning season.",
      "\"I love our new kit, it looks fresh - I'm excited to wear this in front of our incredible supporters,\" Arsenal and England defender Myles Lewis-Skelly said when the kit was released. \"Their energy lifts us and when we step out in the shirt, we feel it more than ever.\"",
      "Aston Villa's away shirt for the 2024-25 season was all white, but that will change for the upcoming campaign. The new dark away shirt made its first appearance on the final day, when Unai Emery's side lost at Manchester United to miss out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As the club explained, the new design also carries a nod to Villa's home city of Birmingham. \"The design on the shoulders is inspired by the Bullring, one of the iconic landmarks on the skyline of Birmingham and where the club’s new store opens today - meaning both fans and players alike will wear the fabric of our city,\" the club explained along with the release in May.",
      "Chelsea were the first Premier League club to release both their home and away shirts. Both were unveiled before the Blues' Club World Cup campaign, with that competition beginning in mid-June, with the blue home kit carrying a nod to London - and their specific part of the capital.",
      "\"The fabric of London is woven into every thread of our new kit, which is inspired by the capital’s iconic landmarks and creative culture,\" a club release read. \"Chelsea Town Hall is among the architectural landmarks subtly featured on the shirt, which was unveiled by Chelsea and Nike today.\"",
      "We've also now seen Chelsea's new away kit. Players from the men's and women's teams got involved in the launch of the white away shirt with red and green trim - a nod to a 70s design.",
      "\"There is an artistic feel to our new away kit, with the photoshoot taking place at Saatchi Gallery on the King’s Road and the colour palette inspired by a cult classic kit from days gone by,\" the club announced. \"Our manager from the early 1970s, Dave Sexton, introduced an away strip back then which was a tribute to Hungary’s famous ‘Magnificent Magyars’ team from two decades earlier and it evolved into a white shirt with a broad red and green vertical stripe.\"",
      "Manchester City have shown it is possible to keep traditional colours and still get a bit creative. Their 2025-26 home kit will predominantly be sky blue, as usual, but with a white sash.",
      "City also have a sash on their change strip for the Club World Cup, which is predominantly white, in a nod to their 2009-10 away kit. However, this will just be used for the tournament, with City confirming a new away kit will be unveiled ahead of the upcoming league season.",
      "Manchester United won't have a chance to show off their new home kit in Europe, having lost in the final of last season's Europa League. However, they've wasted little time showing off what they will wear next term.",
      "United's new shirt has adidas' famous three stripes in black on the shoulders, while there is also a graphic on the sleeves inspired by the club's Old Trafford Stadium. It's capped off by the words 'Theatre of Dreams' just below the collar on the back.",
      "\"The colour red is fundamental to the club's DNA. There have been many different expressions of it over the years and, for this season, we wanted to do something a little different, using the sleeves as a canvas,\" adidas' Jurgen Rank said. \"The abstract graphic stays true to the club's DNA while providing an innovative look and feel to an otherwise classy and classic jersey.\"",
      "It's black and white again for Newcastle - no surprises there - but with a twist. The classic stripes are blended with a shepherd's check for a slightly different take on the usual colours.",
      "Newcastle debuted the kit at the end of last season against Everton, when they qualified for the Champions League despite losing their home closer. The club has also pledged to donate £5 per shirt sold to the Newcastle United Foundation.",
      "\"It’s a way for supporters to not only wear the badge, and the beautiful new kits with pride, but to directly contribute to the life-changing work the Foundation does across the region,\" chief commercial officer Peter Silverstone said. \"Together, we’re making a difference – on and off the pitch.”",
      "Spurs didn't just appoint a new manager in the first half of June - they also unveiled their new home shirt. The Europa League winners now know what they will be wearing as they look to build under that success under new boss Thomas Frank.",
      "\"The 2025/26 Kit features a subtle tweak to the navy sleeves of last season, with a new grey and ashen slate pattern under the arm and the traditional lilywhite base forming the outer part of the sleeve,\" the club announced when unveiling the new Nike shirt. The kit release was accompanied by a video featuring club legend Ledley King.",

      "The former Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham City defender would often bring his football-mad son to work, where Toffees favourites like Wayne Rooney and Duncan Ferguson kindly took him under their wing. However, it was one of their opponents who Ollie was most starstruck by as a youngster - Manchester United legend Ronaldo.",
      "Mick revealed how it led to a very awkward encounter with the Portuguese forward in a corridor after a match between Everton and United. The incident, which left Ronaldo distinctly unimpressed, occurred after Ollie tasked his dad with getting his shirt signed by his idol.",
      "Recounting the episode in his book, The Smell of Football, Mick said: \"Sometimes, I must admit, when surrounded by these superstars, I just wanted to grab a pen and piece of paper and get their autographs, but this was frowned upon as being totally uncool.",
      "\"A few years ago, however, when we played United, Ollie begged me to get Cristiano Ronaldo's autograph on his brand new Portugal shirt that he had just received for his birthday. I really didn’t like to ask and did feel a bit of an anorak, but you know what it's like - you will do anything for your kids, won't you?",
      "\"I kept my eyes open after the game to try and catch sight of Ronaldo passing the medical room. Eventually, I saw him and stepped into the busy passageway, clutching the shirt. I was in my full Everton regalia, so I didn't feel too much of an intruder.",
      "\"'Excuse me, Cristiano, could you please sign this for my son?' He didn't look too pleased, but grabbed the shirt and the pen without looking up or acknowledging my existence, and started scribbling. 'Can you write, 'To Oliver, happy birthday' on it please Cristiano?' He still didn't look up but just kept scribbling.",
      "\"'It’s O-L-I-V…' I didn't get any further. He just threw the shirt back in my face where, due to the phenomenon that is static electricity, it stuck. He then walked away, leaving me with the shirt on my head.\"",
      "Mick added: \"There were a couple of the Everton press guys in the corridor that day who saw it all, and we absolutely p***ed ourselves laughing for the next 10 minutes. Never again.\"",
      "Ollie got a taste of life at United for himself as a youngster after coming up through the club's academy at the same time as the likes of Marcus Rashford. The 28-year-old spent eight years with the Red Devils before joining Rochdale in 2016 due to a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "He later signed for Rotherham, where he enjoyed a three-year stint, until moving to Wrexham for £500,000 last summer. Ollie impressed in his first campaign with the club owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, helping Phil Parkinson's side to achieve promotion from League One.",
      "He was also named as the club's player of the season after scoring eight goals in 41 league games. Mick has expressed his delight at Ollie's achievements at Wrexham after aiding them in reaching the Championship for the first time in 43 years.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "\"He got a knock on the ankle early on in the season and had to work hard to get into the side, but once he did you knew he was going to give his all to remain there. He's consistent, got a great work-rate and he'll give you everything - and fans appreciate that.",
      "\"Supporters pay their hard-earned cash and if they see players giving it their all, they'll like you. I was a bit like that in my playing days at Blackburn as giving 100 per cent every game is the minimum requirement for a footballer, whether you're playing for Barcelona or the Dog and Duck.\"",

      "Manchester United should sign Victor Osimhen this summer instead of Viktor Gyokeres. That's according to Rio Ferdinand, who reckons the Nigerian striker is a better fit for his former club. The Red Devils struggled for firepower this season, with Rasmus Hojlund finding the net just four times in the Premier League.",
      "Last summer's marquee signing Joshua Zirkzee has also failed to impress at Old Trafford, with just three league goals in 32 games. With just 44 goals registered as a team - the second lowest amount in the Premier League outside of a relegated Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester - it is clear that United need to bring a talisman to the north west in the coming months.",
      "And Ruben Amorim is eager to welcome fresh faces to overhaul his inherited squad. United have already struck a £62.5million deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, and are trying to work out terms with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Another name linked with the Red Devils is Sporting CP sensation Gyokeres, who scored 39 goals and provided eight assists to help his side clinch the Primeira Liga title this season. However, Ferdinand believes Napoli's Osimhen is a better option, given he has far more experience than the 27-year-old Swede.",
      "\"So, I think you need someone in all the good teams you see. They normally have at least one of the attacking players, normally the number nine. And you go, actually, yeah, I can pin my hat on him. I can rely on him.",
      "\"And I think Hojlund's lack of experience has been a big factor. So, a striker, I don't want any striker. I think I've said it on my podcast many times. I think a striker with experience, knows his right way around the football field, who the young ones they've invested in, like Hojlund and Zirkzee and Chido [Obi] can learn from.\"",
      "On Gyokeres, he added: \"I think Gyokeres, everyone's talking about him. Again, I think if I'm looking at the market now and I had to pick him or Osimhen, I'd probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.",
      "\"And he's shown he's done it in multiple leagues now. And he's done it internationally as well. I think he's a top-class number nine who, again, the young players will be able to learn from. I'm not saying that Gyokeres would fail. I'm just saying that if I had a preference, I would go there.\"",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres, they will have to beat Arsenal to the punch, with Mikel Arteta also linked with the star striker in a bid to bolster his own strike force for 2025/26.",
      "Gyokeres's contract has a reported £85m release clause, so the Red Devils could be forced to pay in excess for his services, given that he is contracted with Sporting until 2028. Club president Frederico Varandas also recently announced that interested parties will have to part ways with more than his £59m price tag.",
      "Osimhen, meanwhile, is unsettled at Napoli, but the club will still want big money to part ways with him this summer. A £63m deal with Al-Hilal was reportedly accepted by the Serie A giants recently, only for the 26-year-old to decide against a move to the Middle East.",
      "However, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus all thought to be interested in the striker, Manchester United will again face stiff competition for his signature.",
      "Ferdinand's comments come as he launches his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of connecting teenagers and parents in planning their futures. Speaking about the cause, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

The former Manchester United star is expected to succeed Miron Muslic, who masterminded the FA Cup win over Liverpool but left for Schalke last month.",
      "Cleverley meanwhile is out of a job having been sacked by Watford last month. He had led the Hornets to a 14th-place finish in the second tier in his first full season.",
      "Plymouth had spoken to four candidates about their vacancy with Cleverley emerging as the frontrunner. Former Arsenal star Jack Wilshere, who had been caretaker boss at Norwich, was also interviewed but looks set to miss out according to the Guardian.",

      "The Pilgrims knew their relegation was all but confirmed ahead of the final day with a hugely inferior goal difference meaning they were ultimately down. They were beaten by Leeds at Home Park which bought an end to their two-year stay in the Championship.",
      "Their demise began with Wayne Rooney at the helm. Cleverley's former team-mate at Old Trafford was handed another managerial gig in the Championship but struggled for results. He won five of his 25 games before he was shown the door just after Christmas.",
      "He left Plymouth sitting in the relegation zone and, despite an upturn in form that saw them down the likes of Sheffield United, they couldn't save themselves and will hope to bounce back at the first time of asking. They are among the pre-season favourites for promotion.",
      "Rooney has said on his stint: \"I loved my time there - I think the fans were great, the staff were great. We just hit a bad run of form and the players actually you know I can't fault them, they were trying everything. Maybe we just lacked that bit of quality.\"",
      "Rooney's successor, Muslic, appeared to take a swipe at the Evertonian and claimed that the club would never have gone down had he been in charge all season. \"I think if I'm the head coach from day one we will be far, far away from the relegation zone,\" he said previously.",

      "Amorim's side have already lost several senior stars this summer, with the club announcing their released and retained lists. Victor Lindelof, Cristian Eriksen and Jonny Evans will all leave when their contracts expire, though discussions remain over an extension for Tom Heaton.",
      "Cunha is unlikely to be the last new arrival, though. Despite failing to qualify for the Champions League - or indeed any UEFA competition - Amorim's team have money to spend.",
      "We're also anticipating a number of exits as United prepare to raise funds for further new faces. Bruno Fernandes might be staying put, but it's likely to be a different story when it comes to the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "Matheus Cunha has opened up on his love for Manchester United after joining the club. The Brazilian's first Premier League move came when he left Atletico Madrid for Wolves, but he now has the chance to pull on United's famous red shirt.",
      "“It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\" Cunha said. \"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",
      "\"I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality. I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my teammates and prepare for the season ahead. All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”",

      "“Of course, contact with Jadon is always there, in some way, because we have a very long history,” Kehl said as Dortmund prepare to begin their Club World Cup campaign. The deadline for registering players in time for the competition's group stage has already passed, and Sancho is still at Old Trafford.",

      "Recent reports have claimed the ex-Coventry City forward has threatened to go on strike to force an exit. Arsenal and Manchester United have both been heavily linked, but it appears either club will have a hard time bartering with the Portuguese champions, who are demanding £67million, despite Gyokeres reportedly being of the impression that he could depart for as little as £60m.",
      "Six years ago, Gyokeres' potential future team-mate Bruno Fernandes - who was at Sporting at the time - was of interest to United and Tottenham, but the club were reluctant to sell. Eventually, United signed him at the end of the 2020 January transfer window in a £67.8m deal.",
      "Before the Red Devils secured his signature, Ronaldo made a six-word remark where he appeared to tell Fernandes to do everything he could to leave the Jose Alvalade Stadium. Speaking to Portuguese television station TVi, Ronaldo said: \"Nobody knows why he (Fernandes) doesn't leave.\"",
      "The ex-United forward also said he had spoken to Fernandes and urged him to do everything he could to fulfil his potential, suggesting the midfielder has to leave Sporting to get to the top of his game. He added: \"Possibly this new generation will be the best at the talent level.",
      "\"But that's not enough. They have to want to. I have spoken to him [Fernandes]. I'm a captain who wants to help and be helped.”",
      "Gyokeres is no international team-mate of Ronaldo's but he can certainly relate to what the now Al-Nassr forward said to Fernandes. Ronaldo also left Sporting to join United in a £12.2m move all the way back in 2003.",
      "While Sir Alex Ferguson said United had a positive relationship with Sporting, the Scot also admitted the deal took, \"some time\" to get over the line. United failed in signing Fernandes in the 2019 summer transfer market and were close to missing out on him again the following January, but managed to secure a deal with one day left of the window.",
      "If United are to sign Gyokeres this year, they could be made to wait in similar fashion. Portuguese outlet Record understands Gyokeres was under the impression that he and the club had agreed a gentleman's agreement, which would allow him to leave if a bid of £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons was made.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently denied the existence of this agreement. The Lisbon chief said: \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Lisbon are now understood to be after £67m from potential suitors. Gyokeres has scored a barnstorming 97 goals in 102 appearances since his £20m move from Coventry City in 2023. CNN Portugal recently claimed Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya has met with Arsenal's owners.",
      "It's also understood that the north Londoners sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a move for the striker. Talks are described as being \"very advanced\" between the two sides.",
      "However, Arsenal have also been linked with a move for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. The young Slovenian has been on their radar for a long time, but the Daily Mail understands the Bundesliga giants are demanding at least £75m for his services.",

      "Manchester United have completed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. The 26 year-old Brazilian international forward has signed a contract until June 2030, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Brazil forward Cunha, United’s first signing of the summer window, said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player. Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",
      "“I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality. I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my teammates and prepare for the season ahead.",
      "“All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”  Jason Wilcox, United’s Director of Football, said: “Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window.",
      "“He has proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League as one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England during his time at Wolves, and before that in Spain and Germany.",
      "“He has all the qualities we are looking for as we seek to build a strong, dynamic and entertaining team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.”",
      "The deal had been announced initially by both United and former club Wolves on June 1. In a short club statement, Wolves declared: \"Everyone at Wolves would like to thank Matheus for his contributions in old gold and wish he and his family the best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "United prioritised a move for Cunha this summer after his exploits for Wolves in 2024-25 and their own failings in front of goal. United were the Premier League's fifth lowest scorers, while the Brazilian scored 17 goals and added six assists as he earned Wolves' Players' Player of the Season award.",
      "His flexibility also appealed, with head coach Ruben Amorim penciling in a role for Cunha as one of his two No.10s in the Portuguese's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is the top target for the other role, while United are still pushing for a new No.9 also.",
      "Cunha only signed a new contract at Molineux in February, having failed to land a big-money move in January. His new deal contained the £62.5m release clause which United have agreed to pay, but only after attempting to persuade Wolves to allow them to meet the terms of the clause over a longer period.",
      "Instead, Wolves refused to budge, and United quickly agreed to pay the full amount as per the terms in his contract with the Black Country side, meaning Wolves will see £20.83m up front, another £20.83m at the end of the 2025-26 season, and the remaining £20.83m at the end of the 2026-27 campaign."

      "Coventry City will reportedly not receive any money if Sporting CP sell Viktor Gyokeres this summer, despite having negotiated a sell-on clause in his contract. The 27-year-old striker has caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs since becoming one of the most lethal forwards on the continent in the past two seasons.",
      "Gyokeres netted a sensational 54 goals in 52 matches this term on his way to helping Sporting clinch a domestic double. Arsenal, Chelsea, Juventus and Manchester United, managed by his former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, have all shown interest in signing the Swede this summer.",
      "While he has a £84.7million release clause in his Sporting contract, it was initially thought that a £59m bid would be enough for the Portuguese champions to part ways with their star player.",
      "However, their president Frederico Varandas has since rubbished those claims, stating there is no gentleman's agreement in place to allow Gyokeres to leave for £59m. Varandas maintained that the only promise made to Gyokeres was that the club wouldn't demand his full release clause.",
      "Regardless of the price tag Gyokeres eventually leaves Sporting for, Coventry may not see any financial gain from his sale. The Sweden international spent two seasons with the Championship side following an initial loan deal from Brighton, netting 40 goals in 97 games before joining Sporting for an initial £20m.",
      "TalkSPORT has now reported that City sold their clause to Sporting last summer, waiving their right to a future transfer windfall in order to fund their own £18m transfer overhaul. The sell-on clause was said to be worth 10 per cent of any profit on the initial fee Sporting paid to originally sign the player.",
      "However, the Coventry Telegraph reported last summer that the fee was actually reduced by just five percent after Sporting paid the Championship side €1m (£843,500), in addition to the player hitting “certain objectives” over the course of the season.",
      "Initially, Coventry stood to gain 15% of any profit on the initial fee paid by Sporting if Gyokeres was sold on. This percentage was subject to change based on the player's performance, including goals, appearances and club honours, which were add-ons to the initial fee, and amount to €2m (almost £1.7m).",
      "The Sky Blues are said to have received just over £2.5m in add-ons from the initial €20m (£17.5m) fee, bringing their earnings to date up to £20m.",
      "Despite the speculation surrounding Gyokeres, Sporting's Varandas has stated no official bids have been lodged yet. CNN Portugal supported that claim while saying Arsenal are leading the chase for the striker's signature, with the Gunners being his preferred pick over United.",
      "The report read: “Arsenal are the club that Gyokeres has wanted from the very beginning. Gyokeres wants to play for Arsenal, he has stated this desire very openly to his agent. Officially, there has not been an offer yet, but there have been many contacts. This time, it seems that there will be [an offer].”",
      "Portuguese newspaper Record reported that Arsenal’s hierarchy met with Gyokeres’ representative, Hasan Cetinkaya, on Wednesday and an official offer from the Gunners is now expected.",
      "However, reports elsewhere have stated Arsenal’s preference is to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer from RB Leipzig.",

      "Mason Greenwood will play alongside former Manchester United team-mate Angel Gomes next season at Marseille. They will reunite in France five years after Gomes left the Red Devils, having once been left humiliated by former United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "Marseille confirmed this week that they have reached an agreement in principle to sign England international Gomes. The Ligue 1 runners-up, managed by Roberto De Zerbi, beat a host of clubs to his signature, with the 24-year-old reportedly signing a three-year deal at the Orange Velodrome.",
      "RMC Sport previously reported that the United academy graduate was convinced by De Zerbi's style of play and the opportunity to compete in the Champions League. Gomes had announced he would be leaving Lille once his contract expired this summer.",
      "The midfielder made the move to Lille at the end of his United contract in the summer of 2020, having been tipped for great things at Old Trafford after signing for the club back in 2006. The England U21s European Championship winner was handed his debut aged just 16 by Mourinho on the final day of the 2016/17 season, making him United's youngest ever Premier League player.",
      "But despite the trust placed in him by the current Fenerbahce boss, a 17-year-old Gomes was once brought to the brink of tears as a result of Mourinho criticising his performance in a reserve team match in front of the first team.",
      "He told the Athletic: \"I played a game for the reserves and he watched — he didn’t think I played good enough. Two days later, the first team had a game, and he took me with the team. At the pre-match, in front of everybody, he let me know about it.\"",
      "Expanding on the story in an interview with The Times, Gomes explained: \"At the time I was thinking, 'Why has he done that in front of everyone? Could he not have pulled me to the side?'",
      "\"A few of the players came up to me and said, 'He just wants a reaction from you, don't let it faze you', but in that moment, I didn't want to hear anything.",
      "'I rushed to my room and rang my dad and my brother. There's not much they could say to me really. I was almost crying. I was really young.",
      "\"It wasn't until I was older that I realised, with Mourinho, he's always looking at ways to get more out of you. I think him doing that in front of everyone showed he valued me as a player. I probably needed it.\"",
      "He added: \"It's all mental toughness. What I came to learn about Jose is he always wants you to do better. He is almost like prodding you, 'Come on, show me a bit more. Everyone's told me how good you are, but I want to see it.'\"",
      "Despite the psychological blow at the time, Gomes wishes he had been mature enough to embrace Mourinho's management style, saying: \"It wasn't until I left and I see Jose winning trophies that I think, 'Ah, I understand you. And if only I had understood you more, I would have been able to appreciate my time more with you'. But no, in the midst of little b*********s, [he was] an amazing guy.\"",
      "Gomes' departure came during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure, following Mourinho's sacking two years prior in 2018. His game time was extremely limited under Solskjaer while the then-promising Greenwood was enjoying his first-team breakthrough in the 2019/20 season.",
      "After playing a total of 320 minutes for United, Gomes left as a free agent, capping off the \"most difficult period\" of his career. Despite spending the first year of his five-year Lille stint at Portuguese club Boavista, the move to Ligue 1 served to kickstart his career. He made 134 appearances in all competitions for Lille, including 20 this season as they finished fifth in the league.",
      "He also impressed in a Three Lions shirt last year after receiving his first four caps under interim boss Lee Carsley. However, Gomes has not yet featured under new manager Thomas Tuchel.",

      "Sancho, 25, is out of favour at Old Trafford and spent the 2024-25 season on loan at Chelsea. He is at a career crossroads, though, with the Blues set to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than completing a £25m permanent transfer for the star.",
      "Despite originally being frozen out by Erik ten Hag, its understood Sancho has no future at United under the Dutchman's successor, Ruben Amorim.",
      "And with United desperate to offload several players who have been deemed surplus to requirements in order to raise transfer funds, talk of a return to Dortmund has materialised ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "The Athletic revealed Sancho's representatives had been informed of Dortmund's interest - but Kehl has said a deal for the forward is currently 'not a priority'.",
      "“Of course, contact with Jadon is always there, in some way, because we have a very long history,” Kehl ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup on Thursday.",
      "“But it’s not an issue for us right now. We have other priorities at the moment and that’s why the Sancho issue was probably played up more in the media than discussed internally.”",
      "Sancho established himself as one of Europe's brightest stars at Dortmund across a four-year spell before joining United in a £73m deal in the summer of 2021.",
      "And with his career at a standstill it was Dortmund who gave him a platform to play again during the second half of the 2023-24 campaign, where he helped his old club reach the final of the Champions League.",
      "Dortmund's reported interest in Sancho comes amid claims that a trio of Premier League clubs are interested in offering the winger a chance to kickstart his career.",
      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all said to be keeping an eye on Sancho's situation with a permanent exit from Old Trafford likely in the coming weeks. Villa took Sancho's United team-mate, Marcus Rashford, on loan for the second half of last season but a permanent deal does not appear to be on the cards, hence their interest in Sancho.",

      "The red tape has now been lifted and the transfer has been formally completed. Cunha has signed a five-year contract and is the first new face through the door at Carrington this summer.",
      "“It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player,\" Cunha said.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt. I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.",

      "If you take Cunha's comments about following United when he was a boy at face value, it shows why United will always appeal to transfer targets, regardless of the situation on the pitch.",
      "The supporters of Premier League rivals suggested United would have no pull in the summer transfer window, but top players will always want to represent the biggest club in England.",
      "Cunha received interest from other Premier League sides, but the Brazilian only entertained a move to Old Trafford. It still means something to play for United, which can be forgotten particularly after a nightmare season.",
      "The 26-year-old looked delighted in his unveiling pictures on Thursday afternoon and hasn't stopped posting about United on his social media pages. He is thrilled to have signed.",
      "Cunha didn't waste any time in posting a photo of his son in a United shirt, and his behaviour since the initial announcement of the transfer backs up his claim of \"dreaming\" about playing for the club.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has also expressed that he prefers a move to United this summer, despite interest from Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle, who are all more attractive on paper.",
      "Arsenal are Premier League title challengers, Tottenham beat United in the Europa League final and Newcastle have Champions League football, but Mbeumo prefers United.",

      "Cunha will add goals and athleticism to United's attack, meaning he ticks a variety of boxes for head coach Ruben Amorim. He scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024/25, including 15 in the Premier League.",
      "Despite strengthening their attacking pool with the addition of the former Atletico Madrid forward, United do not want their attacking additions to stop there, with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo next on their hit list.",
      "United, just over 24 hours after announcing they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha, discovered Mbeumo had chosen Old Trafford as his preferred destination this summer. United made an opening offer for the Cameroonian last week, understood to be worth £55m, but it was rejected.",
      "Nevertheless, discussions between United and the Bees have remained ongoing and the Old Trafford outfit are confident of making a breakthrough in negotiations in order to make Mbeumo their second signing of the summer. United would like to get the deal wrapped up in time for the former Troyes man to report to Carrington for pre-season training at the start of July.",
      "In addition to wanting Mbeumo, United remain hungry to sign a striker this summer. Liam Delap was United's top target to bolster their No.9 options, but they were beaten to his signature by Chelsea, meaning they are now looking elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "They have been linked with a collection of strikers in recent weeks, including Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. Gyokeres is keen to leave Sporting and Napoli want to sell Osimhen.",

      "It is thought that now his old manager is at the club, Tottenham is a more lucrative proposition for Mbeumo than it once was. This report will come as a shock for the Reds after they had been confident of signing the predominantly right-sided winger this summer.",
      "However, negotiations remained ongoing and United felt they had received enough reassurance from Mbeumo that Old Trafford was his preferred destination. The Sky report claims that Tottenham's interest remains in its infancy, with initial enquiries having been made about the forward's availability.",
      "Should United now miss out on Mbeumo, the start to their transfer window suddenly becomes a little more bleak as this would be the second high profile target they have missed out. Liam Delap was seen as a priority for the Reds at the beginning of the summer but he would eventually choose to join Chelsea instead."

      "On the day in which Matheus Cunha proudly spoke about the lure of joining Manchester United regardless of the club's current circumstances, the Reds' next priority target may be about to ruin the feel-good factor.",
      "While there could be a desire for Mbeumo to stick with a manager that he knows well, that argument feels flimsy at best. Had the forward wanted to stick with Frank, he could have done this summer by not entering discussions with the Reds.",
      "Instead, Mbeumo decided to negotiate with Ruben Amorim's men as he wanted the new challenge - all of this happened before knowing that Frank was moving to Spurs. So it could be a reason why Spurs now looks intriguing but perhaps there is something more concerning happening here.",
      "Tottenham were not in the conversation for Mbeumo prior to hiring Frank so as far as the Cameroonian was concerned, United were his only option. Now that Spurs are on the table, perhaps they look more enticing because they are in the Champions League and the Reds are not.",
      "When a player is picking their next move, they are always looking at how their career can progress from its current position and if Mbeumo's head is turned by Tottenham, it could be more down to their position in Europe than Frank's arrival. Arguably, United only have a miniscule more pull than Brentford at present due to the size of the club but it is certainly not because they are performing better on the pitch.",
      "If he was basing his decision on that, he would not be leaving the Bees. The concern for United is whether this will soon become a pattern for the Reds.",
      "They are interested in a talent, a club in the Champions League come in, United miss out. It happened with Delap, it could happen with Mbeumo, what's to stop it happening again and again this summer.",
      "If it had not already set in how disappointing the defeat to Spurs was in the Europa League final, it shall soon feel very real for the Reds if they keep being beaten to signings by clubs in Europe. Not every player is going to be like Cunha and perhaps that is something Amorim and co. need to accept."

      "To do that, he will have to be proactive in the summer transfer window and with the market reopening on Monday, it is expected the Reds will be busy before the start of pre-season. Ahead of the second part of the summer, MEN Sport has asked Google's AI software Gemini to name United's dream starting XI for the Premier League next season.",
      "According to the technology, United are realistically just two more transfers away from completing their dream scenario next season. Gemini included Matheus Cunha in the starting line-up following his £62.5m move from Wolverhampton Wanderers and he is placed alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in attacking midfield.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres is deemed to be the next high-profile transfer that United should be looking to make amid a whirlwind summer that he is having. Both the Reds and Arsenal are thought to be leading the way for the Swede with the Lisbon club reportedly under fire from Gyokeres for quoting his asking price at £68m.",
      "It is believed that the former Coventry City man was under the impression that he would be offered out for £51m this summer, something Sporting deny. With that move complicated, Gemini suggests that United could look at Napoli's Victor Osimhen as an alternative.",
      "His release clause is understood to be at a reasonable £63m with the striker having already rejected a move to Al Hilal this summer. The final new addition that AI believes United should make is in goal, with Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez named as the starting shot stopper.",
      "The Argentine looked as though he bid farewell to the West Midlands following the final home game of the season against Tottenham Hotspur. He has been tight-lipped about his future since then and it is believed Villa would be looking for £40m if they were to allow their first-choice 'keeper to leave.",
      "United have been credited with interest as they look at potential options to provide competition to Andre Onana. Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are also believed to be keen on Martinez.",
      "Elsewhere, the dream starting line-up for United is made up of players who are already at the club. The only player who will not make the opening fixture for definite is Lisandro Martinez as he continues his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury.",
      "He should be back towards the end of this year. There is also a new role for Amad to make room for Cunha as he is picked by Gemini to start at right wing-back.",
      "There is no place for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo either, despite United prioritising his signature. Gemini acknowledged that Mbeumo is likely to join United but perhaps see him at this stage as a strong player to come off the bench."

      "Manchester United signing Hugo Ekitike ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool this summer transfer window would move Ruben Amorim closer to having a completely new-look front line next season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, after completing a transfer from Wolverhampton Wanderers on Thursday, confirmed the first step of that overhaul. United director of football Jason Wilcox describes the Brazil international as \"one of the most exciting and productive forwards in England\".",
      "He \"proved his ability to succeed in the Premier League\" at Wolves, notably at Old Trafford in April. However, he is not a centre-forward, playing best as a second striker behind a focal point.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen was that for him last season, holding up play with impressive control and touch at 6ft 4in. Ekitike, in comparison, is of similar stature, at an inch shorter.",
      "The latter, however, is heralded for attacking crosses, cutting inside from the left channel and running into space behind defences akin to Alexander Isak. While there may not be as many opportunities for the latter at United as playing for Eintracht Frankfurt, the other two tendencies bode well for playing in the Premier League.",
      "Being clocked as one of the quickest players in the Bundesliga last season can only help an often slow-looking United forward line. A dozen assists across all competitions last term also hint at a developing ability to link play.",
      "That is what Cunha is due to bring, but complementing the forward like Strand Larsen would be a bonus for Ekitike, as well as being more of a threat in front of goal, scoring 22 times in his first full season for Eintracht. Cunha enjoyed the best season of his career while playing with the big Norwegian, who likewise had his second-best goalscoring campaign.",

      "Cunha and Marmoush are comparable players, with no players across Europe's top five leagues scoring more from outside the penalty area last season. Their five strikes match Bruno Fernandes, Federico Valverde, Lamine Yamal and Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The former, likely being in a more withdrawn role next season, suggests those numbers could drop. Cunha coming in ahead of the United captain suggests he can make up for any reduced productivity from range."

      "The transfer window reopens on Monday, following an initial 10-day period at the start of the month where deals were permitted ahead of the start of the Club World Cup in America.",
      "United wrapped up a move for Matheus Cunha in that initial window after activating his £62.5million release clause at Wolves and made progress on the Mbeumo deal.",
      "The second window will stay open until September 1, shutting at the earlier time of 7pm, but United will want their new recruits in the building long before then.",
      "Indeed, the Reds will aim to conduct the majority of their business this month, ahead of Ruben Amorim's squad returning for pre-season training in the first week of July.",
      "Having new signings in the building ahead of time will allow Amorim the maximum opportunity to work with the players as United aim to improve on a wretched 2024-25 Premier League season. The Reds finished a lowly 15th in the top flight and defeat in the Europa League final ended any hopes of European football.",
      "United will therefore have a lighter match schedule next term, which will allow Amorim more time to implement his methods. And doing so this summer with the new arrivals in place ahead of what will be his first full season in charge, could prove invaluable.",

      "After failing to secure Champions League qualification for next season, United's budget this summer is not as handsome as it would have been had they beaten Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final three weeks ago.",
      "In addition to signing Cunha and attempting to lure Mbeumo, who is believed to be valued at around £60m, to Old Trafford, United also have aspirations of signing a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper. The addition of a specialist right wing-back has also not been ruled out.",
      "If United are to achieve all of their objectives before the end of the summer, they are going to have to try and oversee plenty of outgoings. Although United are prepared to sell any player this summer, some are more likely to move on than others.",
      "The trio, who all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan in 2024/25, are surplus to requirements and head coach Ruben Amorim has no plans to reintegrate them into his squad.",

      "After scoring a respectable 12 Premier League goals for relegated Ipswich Town, Delap attracted interest from a handful of clubs. However, it was Chelsea's project that appealed to him most and he recently made the switch to Stamford Bridge.",

      "Naturally, the rumour mill has been in full swing lately, linking United with just about every striker who has ever scored a goal. However, some names keep cropping up more than others.",
      "Among them are Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, Napoli ace Victor Osimhen and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David, who will leave Lille at the end of this month after five years at the French club.",
      "Each of them rank among the best strikers that are set to be attainable this summer, but who United could end up with come the end of the transfer window remains anybody's guess.",
      "The club is currently focusing on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, meaning incomings could slow until United oversee some outgoings. It is no secret that player sales will dictate what else United may be capable of this summer.",
      "However, one way or another, United must sign a proven goalscorer before the window closes on September 1.",
      "With a proven goalscorer required, United know they are going to have to loosen their purse strings. Established goalscorers are expensive and everyone wants one.",
      "Over the last few years, few strikers have been as consistent in front of goal as Osimhen. The Nigeria international, who Napoli are actively looking to sell this summer, has scored 85 goals over the last three seasons, including 37 goals out on loan at Galatasaray in 2024/25.",
      "Osimhen would be an excellent signing for United. He has a proven record in front of goal, is entering his prime at the age of 26 and he has already admitted he would love to play in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think playing in one of the top five leagues in the world (Serie A) is an amazing feeling for me,\" Osimhen said, speaking back in March 2023.",
      "\"A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but now I'm in one of the best leagues in the world which is the Italian Serie A.",
      "\"I'm working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday but, like I said, it's a process and I just want to keep on this momentum and continue to do well.\"",
      "Although it has not deterred Matheus Cunha from joining United and Mbeumo wanting to join him at Old Trafford, a lack of European football next season could hinder United's chances of attracting Osimhen. He has not gone a season without playing in Europe since 2018/19.",
      "Recently the subject of interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, Osimhen is also likely to command big wages and that could be an issue.",
      "But what United do have is a crop of big-name players they want to sell, including Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine has been informed he can leave if United receive an acceptable offer.",
      "United rejected a £40m bid from Napoli for the 20-year-old in January and are expected to hold out for a higher fee this summer. Somewhere in the region of £50m-£60m would reflect a fair market value for the Argentine based on his potential.",
      "Admired by Napoli and head coach Antonio Conte, it remains to be seen if the Serie A champions will make a fresh approach for Garnacho this summer. If they have retained their interest and show a strong desire to take him to Naples, Osimhen might creep into United's thoughts when negotiating.",

      "United had an opening offer for the Cameroonian turned down last week, understood to be worth £55m, but talks between the two clubs have remained ongoing and an improved is expected to be made once the transfer window reopens next week.",
      "If the Reds extract Mbeumo from the Gtech Community Stadium, they will inherit a player who scored 20 goals in the 2024/25 Premier League campaign. Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of a 17-goal season.",
      "With that said, both would occupy starting berths in M16, immediately forcing their way into Ruben Amorim's first-choice XI. Cunha is expected to operate from the left-sided No.10 role and Mbeumo from the right.",
      "The latter predominantly plays as a right-winger at Brentford but often drifts inside, taking up central positions. His versatility means that he should easily adapt to operating in one of the two playmaker roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "As a result of Cunha and Mbeumo potentially occupying those two positions, Bruno Fernandes and Amad, who often operated as the two No.10s in 2024/25, would have to be deployed elsewhere. Fortunately, both players are versatile enough to operate from different areas of the pitch.",
      "Fernandes is comfortable operating as a No.8 and Amad is equally effective as a right wing-back. And if Fernandes is tasked with making the centre of midfield his permanent residence, he would be only too happy to do so, admitting just over a year ago that he imagined himself operating from a deeper position as his career progressed.",
      "\"In terms of passing, game organisation, defence, tactics,\" Fernandes said, speaking in March 2024. \"I have a little thought in my head that I'm going to end my career further back, because everyone who started there and went to No.10 ended up retreating on the field at the end.",
      "\"It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.\"",
      "Fernandes proved on countless occasions in 2024/25, particularly this side of Christmas, that he is a more than capable operator from the centre of midfield. He enjoyed an excellent run of form between late-January and the March international break, scoring nine times.",
      "If Fernandes is tasked with making one of the two No.8 positions his long-term role, United will have to ensure they find him a suitable midfield partner to compliment his qualities. Manuel Ugarte blew hot and cold in his first season at the club and doubts have been raised about his ability on the ball.",
      "In addition to wanting Mbeumo and a striker, United also remain keen to sign a new midfielder. However, outgoings will dictate what it possible over the course of the summer."

      "Mbeumo has been the subject of interest from the Red Devils for a long time with journalist Ben Jacobs revealing yesterday that Ruben Amorim’s side are set to make a second formal bid “imminently”.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “There hasn’t been a formal second bid placed yet. But what is happening, is there are conversations around a new number, much closer to the Matheus Cunha valuation.",
      "“And when Manchester United feel that not just that number, but the structure is competitive based on their feedback from Brentford – and all of those discussions are ongoing at the moment – the expectation, and quite imminently, is they will then put that formal second bid in with a higher percentage chance.",
      "“Hopefully from Manchester United’s point of view, that will be accepted.”",

      "‘And we reported last week that United are expected to make another offer for the Cameroon star. United are also interested in Semenyo too.’",
      "And former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown – who is still well-connected in the Premier League – reckons Frank ‘could be a big pull for Mbeumo’ this summer.",
      "Brown told Football Insider: “It’s going to be difficult to beat Man United to Mbeumo. United are well down the line on this move, and the player himself wishes to make that move to Old Trafford rather than other potential clubs.",
      "“Thomas Frank could be a big pull for Mbeumo, but United are very optimistic that they’ll be able to land the Cameroon international.",
      "“They’ve had one bid rejected and talks are ongoing with Brentford. They just need to reach a compromise over his fee and then that deal will get done.",
      "“The other factor is that Spurs won’t be able to match United on wages they could offer. So Man United are still in the driving seat to get this done, despite suggestions that Tottenham could hijack their move.”",
      "With Thomas Frank off to Spurs, we have jumped the gun on a possible Brentford exodus and reassigned five Bees stars to rival Premier League clubs…",

      "",
      "18) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "",
      "17) Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",

      "",
      "15) 🆕 Wilfried Ndidi – Leicester to Manchester United\nThe Nigeria midfielder has a £9million release clause and United see him as a good value squad addition to bolster their midfield options, especially if they sell Casemiro this summer. Which makes sense. Everton and the Saudis are also sniffing.",
      "",
      "14) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered. So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Oleksandr Zinchenko – Arsenal to AC Milan\nZinchenko has been surplus to requirements for some time and with a year remaining on his contract, Arsenal are motivated to sell. One problem: his fat salary is too rich for Milan’s taste. If they can overcome that obstacle, this definitely fits.",
      "",
      "12) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Tottenham Hotspur\nThe Cherries reportedly want £70m, which feels unrealistic. A transfer still feels inevitable and Man United, Liverpool and Spurs have all been linked and Londoners are the favourites.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. There is plenty of noise coming from Barca but nothing Liverpool can take to the bank.",

Will they pay the £60million-plus Liverpool apparently want? Only if they’re still p*ssed from their title celebrations. Saudi still seems  the Reds’ best hope of recouping as much of their £85million outlay as possible, but Nunez will have a say. Ambition, or his very own Scrooge McDuck money pit?",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",
      "",
      "8) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Sporting say they haven’t received any offers and they also insist that reports of a gentleman’s agreement for him to leave for £59million are b*llocks. Which Gyokeres disputes. This could get messy.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",

      "",
      "5) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one was moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",

      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",

      "It’s a phenomenal achievement for a club of Brentford’s size and it’s a credit to them and Frank in particular, that it would feel weird not to have them in the Premier League with their feet firmly under the top-flight table.",
      "Frank’s move to Tottenham for a supposed upward career move could raise their relegation fears, but the ever-increasing gap to the Championship should cushion their likely decline next season as Leeds United and co. face an uphill battle to buck a disheartening trend.",

      "With a large chunk of Arsenal’s summer budget likely to be spent on a striker, they may not have the financial muscle to splash out on a direct upgrade on Martinelli and if they decide to pursue an affordable option to compete with, rather than replace, the Gunners star, Schade would not be a bad shout.",
      "The 23-year-old, valued at £25m on transfermarkt amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund, enjoyed a breakout season in 2024/25 and was a consistent provider of goal involvements, with his final total of 13 in 38 games a more-than-respectable tally.",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Arsenal-bound Martin Zubimendi is the best on offer.",
      "",
      "10) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from Nottingham Forest. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "9) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 23 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked at one juncture, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract just weeks ago.",
      "That alone makes him the least likely on this list to actually move this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nPotentially available on a free transfer, Partey is in talks to extend his Arsenal contract. If he does leave, he could be the bargain of the window.",
      "This was the first season since joining Arsenal that Partey has managed to stay fit throughout, which is typical in a contract year. Had his deal expired any other summer, Mikel Arteta would probably have let him walk.",
      "Not only was Partey reliable for once, he also played extremely well, and quietly became one of Arsenal’s most important players.",

      "",
      "7) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "6) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, reportedly telling the club he won’t play for them again, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 25, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "5) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer, reportedly involving a bit of Italian culture, could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",
      "",
      "4) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80million, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",
      "",
      "3) Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nExpect to see a wave of Chelsea players spending time at Strasbourg, as Todd Boehly continues to treat the French club as his own personal Vitesse.",
      "Santos was one of the most impressive midfielders in Ligue 1 this past season and is the only returning loanee Enzo Maresca has included in Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad, with Strasbourg team-mate Djordje Petrovic missing out.",
      "Despite his huge ceiling, Chelsea seem happy to sell him to fund the next phase of their transfer binge, even if his replacement is worse and has less potential. Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and could move if Partey doesn’t extend his contract.",
      "",
      "2) Ederson (Atalanta)\nThere’s a good chance Ederson ends up in Saudi Arabia, with Club World Cup-bound Al Hilal keen to sign him from Atalanta.",
      "They won’t have him in time for the tournament and struggled to convince top targets before the first summer deadline, so he’s high on their list. The 25-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad)\nTechnically, Zubimendi is available – and reportedly has an agreement with Arsenal.",

      "Former England manager Fabio Capello has suggested that a struggling Manchester United forward is a safer signing for Inter Milan than another option.",
      "United had a terrible 2024/25 season. The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League – their worst finish ever in the competition.",
      "Their top scorers in the league scored eight goals apiece, and neither were strikers. The highest-scoring striker out of centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee was the former, who bagged four goals in 32 games – one more than the Dutchman in the same amount.",
      "There’s been heavy speculation on the future of the pair, particularly Hojlund.",
      "He has been linked with a move back to Italy – where he played with Atalanta prior to his £72million United signing – with Inter Milan, and Capello feels he’d be a good option.",
      "He wrote in Gazzetta dello Sport: ‘I’ve read a few names, from Hojlund to [Ange-Yoan] Bonny. I’m a fan of the former even if he hasn’t exactly shone at Manchester United.",
      "‘However, the Dane is a very dynamic striker, good at exploiting space. Even though he was very young, he impressed me at Atalanta. Bonny is a different kind of striker, more involved in the build-up play, but probably less ready. Shall I say it? He would be a riskier choice.’",
      "Bonny, at 21, is just a year younger than Hojlund, and just finished a Serie A season for Parma with six goals and four assists.",
      "Hojlund’s only season in Italy saw him back nine Serie A goals and four assists, but his last season in any football was an underwhelming one.",
      "In any case, it is believed that Inter might well make attempts to land Hojlund. It is believed that the Serie A side have tried to sign both the Dane and his United team-mate Zirkzee.",
      "United will reportedly not stand in Hojlund’s way, and a loan with an option or an obligation for Inter to sign him has been suggested.",
      "The Dane is believed to have given his availability to return to Italy and embrace the Inter cause. It’s suggested as a result that the Serie A side will go full steam ahead for the signing.",

      "No, not the Dave Watson of Everton FA Cup-winning fame. This is the David Watson of relative journeymanship, who ended up at Werder Bremen in 1979 after spells with Notts County, Rotherham, Sunderland and Manchester City. His red card and subsequent eight-week ban in his second Werder game – as well as an early return to England – meant he played more often for his country (four times) than his club (twice) while in Germany.",

      "In that eternal race to live off a cameo minute every other game when Kane is given a rest by being substituted late on, Abraham really staked his claim in a 27-goal debut season with Roma. But things have tailed off since for a striker whose international victims scream Three Lions heritage: Montenegro, Andorra and San Marino.",

Then 27, the winger would stay around the England set-up, earning his last six international caps in France. Not bad to say he left after 12 months, and had only been capped five times in two years with Rangers.",

After his particular brand of Fronting Up reached a crescendo at Euro 2016, Hart was bombed out of the Manchester City starting line-up by Pep Guardiola but held on to his England shirt for a while, including during that weird loan in Italy where his name was listed as ‘John’ on a team sheet that one time, despite his actual name being neither that nor Joe, but instead Charles. Fair play. No chance you get away with calling yourself ‘Hartdog’ if your name is Charles.",

      "Owen is not remembered all that fondly in Real Madrid – or any of his former clubs really – despite an impressive record of 17 goals in 26 starts. During his sole season in Spain, he retained his England place and duly netted six times in 11 matches. That included a hat-trick in a win over Colombia in May 2005 – six days after former club Liverpool had lifted the Champions League.",

He earned more caps in three years at Rangers (22) than in four with Tottenham (20), as well as 12 at Lazio and three with Middlesbrough. He was sadly never even called up while at Chinese second-tier side Gansu Tianma, despite boasting a record of two goals in four games.",

In the same summer Gazza left Tottenham for Lazio, Walker departed his Nottingham Forest home to try his luck at Sampdoria. His time in Serie A was not quite so memorable, with Sven-Goran Eriksson playing him out of position at right-back in his only year outside of England, but he did keep his international place.",

      "Two-and-a-half seasons of learning under the cojones of Simeone did absolutely nothing whatsoever to impact the England prospects of Trippier; it might even have strengthened them, considering it was somewhere around the defender’s move to Spain when Gareth Southgate decided that yeah, this man is also a left-back. It does not feel like a coincidence that he retired from international football straight after the manager resigned.",

      "Detroit Express (2), Sampdoria (20)",
      "Most will know that many of Francis’ England caps came during his spell in Sampdoria, but he also earned a couple of call-ups while on a weird kind of loan with NASL side Detroit Express. He headed to America at the end of the 1977/78 season with Birmingham, returned to become the first £1m footballer with Nottingham Forest in February 1979, then went back to Detroit that summer, never fully losing his grip on an England place.",

      "One Man Utd fan is more than happy for Liverpool to spend a fortune on Florian Wirtz in a Juan Sebastian Veron and Faustino Asprilla-flavoured gamble.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Florian Asprilla or Faustino Wirtz?\nHi guys",
      "I think Niall makes some valid points. The only caveat I have is that Arne just won the league with a squad 99% created by Jurgen Klopp. I’m therefore confident that he’ll get it right with the players he wants to add to the squad.",
      "That said, the injury to Bajetic, who I thought might be Gravenberch’s understudy this season, highlights what Niall is saying that we should perhaps be prioritising other positions. If Grav is injured, does that mean our midfield is Mac, Szobo and Wirtz? And do we then bench Frimpong, and play Bradley as the much more defensive right back?",
      "If Kevin Keegan was our manager, I’d be emailing calling the Wirtz deal our Faustino Asprilla moment. As it is, in Arne we trust (but if he changes his mind, we trust then also).\nMichael, LFC, in Hackney",
      "",
      "There was an interesting take from Niall about whether we should be splashing out on Wirtz. Then noticed Football365 already (jokingly?) heating up the Wirtz Vs Cherki debate before its even started with the 10 transfers article.",
      "All this during times when one the one hand its very exciting to be linked with a mega-money signing but there is also the worry about what happens if it all falls through…the worst possible thing… being mocked by rival fans.",
      "I remember well the mocking and jeers at Caicedo chose Chelsea over us.  At the time it was a bit depressing. Going to be honest not that sad about it now though.",
      "I was kind of with Niall that maybe its too much and we shouldn’t be offering so much for one player, but then remembered that was exactly how I felt about Van Dijk, He was too expensive and we had embarrassed ourselves. That worked out pretty well. So I reckon we trust the Liverpool system now and realise they probably know what they are doing. They definitely know more than me about what is worth spending the money on.",
      "Anyway making a team of Dan’s was way trickier than I thought it would be. I realised that Dani Pacheco is 34 now and his breakthrough season is coming.",
      "GK Danny Ward\nRB Danny Alves\nCB Dan Burn\nCB Danilo Luiz da Silva\nLB Danny Rose",
      "CM Danny Murphy against Man united or Daniele De Rossi otherwise\nAM Dani Pacheco\nLW Dani Olmo\nRW Dan James",
      "ST Daniel Sturridge",
      "Don’t think its beating many teams sadly.",
      "Some Subs: Daniel Agger, Dani Carvajal, Danilo(Other one), Danny Mills, Dani Ceballos, Danny Ings, Danny Welbeck\nDan T",
      "",
      "Interesting to see Niall, Annapolis’ take on Liverpool’s move for Florian Wirtz this morning. I’m a United fan so I always have to parse my views on the Scousers’ business and avoid the “hope this goes to shit” lens that can distort my takes.",
      "But even when (I think) I manage to do that, I don’t see this as anything other than an odd departure from Liverpool’s normal modus operandi. The Frimpong and Kerkez deals make perfect sense – signing sorted early in the window, decent value obtained, lots of potential upside and limited exposure.",
      "But paying over £110m for one player, who maybe needs to be accommodated in a number 10 role which hasn’t been an orthodox part of Liverpool’s system for the past decade, looks laden with risk. Maybe this is the beginning of Slot shifting from Klopp’s system having had the good sense to not tear everything up when he first arrived. Maybe the balance between midfield and attack can be tweaked and refined. I wouldn’t assume to know the nuances of top level football well enough to categorically state one or the other.",
      "But in the interests of speculating, it does feel a bit Veron-to-United, or maybe Asprilla-to-Newcastle. A high profile, high quality player being added while in a position of strength, but maybe an unnecessary move that creates a selection issue rather than complementing the existing squad.",
      "To my eyes, that money would be better spent on a striker who gets closer to Firmino’s old levels than Nunez has since he joined.",
      "I could obviously be proven spectacularly wrong. Wirtz might be the centrepiece of a grand plan and maybe they build successfully around him. But as a fan of what should be a rival club, I’m okay-ish with Liverpool planning to spend such a high % of their transfer funds on him. To put it in terms that fans of the other big teams might relate to: I’d feel infinitely more concerned if they were dangling that £110m+ in front of Newcastle and going heavy to get Isak.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "Am I missing something?\nAt the bottom of many of the pages I read on this very fine website a poll is running, ‘Who will win the 2025/26 Premier League title?’ and the current results are shocking, they may have changed but at the time of writing it is as below:",
      "Liverpool – 45%\nArsenal – 21%\nMan City – 14%\nChelsea 5%\nNewcastle – 5%\nOther – 11%",
      "I’m just going to rank these in the order I think the top 4 teams will actually finish next season:",
      "1st. Man City – 14% – Huh?",
      "How has Man City fallen this far in the eyes of the “informed” football public? This is a team that has won 6 out of the last 8 seasons, a team that has beaten record after record consistently since Pep took over, a team that had a manager who had quite a few personal problems to deal with this season and still finish 3rd after a meltdown and missing their best player, the lynch pin of the squad, being out for most of the season.",
      "They started rebuilding in January and have just added more quality players, a lot of people forget how this team was built, to solve problems this City team just spends £50 million on a player, if it doesn’t work out, they buy another £50 million player in the same position, rinse and repeat, look at the saga of left back till Kyle Walker signed. They have been keeping their hand in their pocket for the last couple of seasons (probably due to a 115 reasons) but don’t get this team wrong, they are willing to spend and spend big to get back on their perch.",
      "FFP means nothing to them until a punishment is given and by cementing themselves as too big to fail, the FA are more than likely to just roll over, charge them £100 million and dock them 40 points, they finish 8th – 6th on 60 points that season and then go back to winning ways getting another 3 titles until Pep buggers off and then the clone of Alex Ferguson takes over just to take the piss.",
      "How quick people forget, barring Rodri suffering from PTSD due to his injury, this team will win the title next season, just look at the team. Erling will put his other scoring boots on and get the golden boot by December (its weird that a striker who got 31 goals in 44 appearances is seen as a poor season but he is that good), Rodri is one of only 2 defensive players to win the Ballon d’Or in recent memory (last 20 years), Phil Foden is still quite talented, Cherki and Reijnders are coming, they have a shed load of underage talent (not in the Epstein way) and Ederson is Ederson and always will be Ederson. They’ve even got Oscar Bobb, who you’ve never heard of but he has one premier league medal more than you.",
      "This is Man Cities title to lose, the also rans will just have to wait till Pep goes through another divorce or for FFP to give a points deduction, which ever comes first.",
      "2nd. Liverpool – 45% – Wait, what?",
      "At the start of this season Liverpool people thought we were lucky to make it into the top four, let alone win the thing with 4 games to go. I think Liverpool were criminally underrated due to the unknown of Arnie Slot, the season before they had been trying to get the quady for Klopp and were very close (they still had a chance until the 17/03), the change of manager was the only major thing and for the first half of this season no team could touch them, Liverpool went from a team that was on default tactics on Pro Evo to the dick who spends 40 minutes setting up their team while everyone else sits around getting drunk.",
      "They were more fun under Klopp but they are now scarier, Klopps team were headstrong running though walls, if the wall didn’t go down they would still run until they knocked themselves out, Slots team has learnt to move around the wall, apart from the PSG match which they lost but were incredible in, this team always looked like it could go to another level in a match but usually won without having to do it.",
      "The transfers of Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz are statement signings, showing intent to be the next era of football, beating all in their path, sadly, like Klopps team when we bought Allison and Van Dyke, they are coming up against a juggernaut called Man City. A striker will help and Liverpool will push City all the way to the end but they will not beat them, this season wasn’t the start of Man Cities downfall, it was just a blip that happened under extraordinary bad luck, luck they have paid a lot of money to change.",
      "I understand recency bias but nearly half the people who visit this website think Liverpool will win next season, I find that insane, we might be making the right noises but you can’t forget the past, it always bloody repeats itself.",
      "3rd. Arsenal – 21% – Ha!",
      "I don’t want to troll Arsenal fans, some of my best friends are Arsenal fans but 21% HA. This team is youngish, has unbelievable talent and can beat anyone on their day, they have an attack that a Saudi team would pay a billion for and a defence that would get £750 million, they have a lot more strength than a “usual” Arsenal team and have the options to bully or out pass a lot of teams, on football manager this is the team you would want as it’d take a few shrewd signings and some really good half time team talks to be a treble winner.",
      "The problem I’ve found with this Arsenal team is the sense of entitlement, the manager and a vocal minority of the fan base, seem to have, they both have an excuse for every situation and seem to think that they deserve to win it just because they played well for 3 seasons. “If it wasn’t for a red card”, “If we hadn’t had injuries”, “If the wind had blown in a different direction”, “if the season had started at christmas…”, its just excuse after excuse.",
      "When Liverpool were always the bridesmaid they didn’t complain anywhere near the amount as some of these youtube, voice of the fan, cockgobblers and Klopp didn’t whine as much as Arteta does, he’s a sexy man with a sexy wife with a sexy life, why does he always look like someone has pissed on his chips. (Might try and turn that last line into a song)",
      "This unearned arrogance seems to have seeped into the mentality of the team, the strops the players have from time to time are apparent, a card goes against them, a VAR decision is DEFINITELY wrong or a tackle was a bit hard and they down tools, wanting to take the ball home because the beautiful game has been marred because its not the Arsenal way.",
      "If this team got a new manager (hopefully Arteta just moves on when they come third next season so the board don’t look like bad guys when they fire him) they could go from strength to strength, if he hadn’t of managed Tottenham Ange would of been great as long as he wasn’t allowed near the tactics, his infectious personality and will to win while also admitting when they are shit was a breath of fresh air and if it had been at Arsenal you could see a completely different player mentality.",
      "Another reason for my reaction is that they haven’t won anything, don’t bring up that bloody FA Cup, they are always near but in the final part of a season/cup they just fall away because they thought they’d already won it, this season would of been hilarious if Man City had got up to second, another “How does Arsenal come 3rd in a 2 horse race?” would of turned them into the new Spurs and who wouldn’t want Arsenal to turn into the new Spurs.",

      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "First summer transfer window shuts as Premier League's Club World Cup clubs, Chelsea and Manchester City, both make moves ahead of tournament; Man Utd make most expensive signing with £62.5m arrival of Matheus Cunha; main summer window reopens on Monday and closes on September 1",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 12:16, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres through intermediaries, with Ruben Amorim a big admirer of his former striker; Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games last season; United also expected to bid again for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting; Sweden international is in-demand after a sensational spell in Portugal which has sent his value soaring; Gyokeres has also attracted interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 15:13, UK",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",
