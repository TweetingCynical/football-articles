      "Ruben Amorim has already offered an explanation after appearing to upset Joshua Zirkzee during Manchester United's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa. The Dutchman came off the bench in the defeat but perhaps expected to be introduced earlier than he was.",
      "United found themselves trailing on the stroke of half-time during their trip to Villa Park after Morgan Rogers' sublime curling effort. Matheus Cunha levelled prior to the break, but Rogers added a second just before the hour mark and secured all three points for Unai Emery's side.",
      "A casualty of the loss was captain Bruno Fernandes, who suffered what appeared to be a hamstring injury during the first half but continued playing. Zirkzee was a frontrunner to replace him at the interval but United icon Gary Neville was \"surprised\" to see Lisandro Martinez come on in his place.",
      "Neville stated that Zirkzee looked upset at not being brought on at half-time, despite being introduced after 73 minutes, but Amorim provided an applicable explanation for a similar decision last season.",
      "\"I'm surprised as I thought Zirkzee would come on as he is closer to Fernandes' position,\" he said before adding: \"He [Zirkzee] doesn't look like he's too happy.\"",
      "But a not dissimilar situation occurred last campaign. Zirkzee started a tie against Newcastle in December 2024 but with United trailing 2-0 after 32 minutes, he was brought off the pitch and looked visibly distraught.",
      "Amorim explained after the match: \"You have to think about the team. The player is suffering during the game. We needed another midfielder. It was tough on me to do that. I talked with Joshua about that.",
      "\"I'm always thinking about the team. At that moment it was important for him to come out. I know that Josh is a really good guy. When he went to the tunnel, I can understand that some guys can be in a bad way but he is a really good lad.\"",
      "He added: \"It is life, and we will support Josh and continue. Newcastle were better than Manchester United. They weren't better than Josh.\"",
      "Neville also had his say during this controversial substitution, much like he did when Zirkzee was not introduced against Villa. He said: \"I know that he's earning a lot of money but there's a human being in there that's basically being cheered off by his home fans and that is brutal.\"",
      "Despite Amorim making decisions surrounding Zirkzee for the good of the team, the Dutchman continues to be linked with a move away from the club.",
      "Zirkzee was only signed in July 2024 from Bologna for £36.5million, but reports suggest he could make a swift return to Italy. Corriere dello Sport claim Roma are interested in Zirkee and the only thing currently preventing a transfer is a disparity on fees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was caught on camera hitting out at Aston Villa supporters from the dugout during Manchester United's defeat to the Premier League side. Fernandes was taking his place among the substitutes after picking up an injury during the game, which saw him replaced.",
      "With his hood up and Villa fans laughing, Fernandes could be seen turning in their direction and attempting to put them down. \"You sing more for me than for your team,\" he said.",
      "\"Don't be angry because I score always against you,\" he added with a smile. The Villans offered a sarcastic cheer as Fernandes was guided back into his seat by a member of United staff and faced the pitch.",
      "The Red Devils captain's smile may not have lasted too long as Morgan Rogers' goals on either side of Mathues Cunha's effort ensured a 10th win in a row for Unai Emery's side. Fernandes was unable to add to his own impressive record against Villa, in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "The 31-year-old has scored more goals against the Midlands club than any other opponent. United's talisman has bagged seven goals in 13 appearances and added three assists.",
      "He was left with little to smile about in defeat and did not receive a reassuring prognosis. Fernandes could be ruled out for a month.",
      "\"It's a soft tissue, I think he's going to lose some games,\" said Amorim after the game against Villa. \"I don't know for sure. Let's see. I don't know. I don't what to talk about matters you can't control.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit, so he might recover quite well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out. We will see. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.\"",
      "Despite Fernandes' absence, Gary Neville believes United were the better team against Villa. The former club captain was reassured by the performance from Amorim's side.",
      "“I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them,\" he said. “Now that’s going to continue to happen whilst they don’t have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don’t have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "“I don’t think they are anywhere near good enough to get into that top three, but what I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed, quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change – the five or the three at the back, the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front – has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That’s a good thing.”",

      "It is a problem Manchester United have not really had to deal with, but one that Ruben Amorim is now faced with: what to do without Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes is not only United’s captain and talisman, but also a near ever-present. Since signing from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, the playmaker has barely missed a game. He sat out of two matches at the end of the 2023/24 season with a knee complaint and, later, another due to illness. Otherwise he has been there, in almost every starting line-up, making 308 appearances and contributing 103 goals and 93 assists.",
      "Fernandes is inarguably United’s best and most consistent player. And he is arguably the most important player for any Premier League side, such is his complete and utter dominance of Amorim’s team. And now he’s unavailable.",
      "For how long, we don’t yet know. Amorim said he will likely “lose some games” after being forced off at half-time against Aston Villa on Sunday. Diogo Dalot described his absence – for Boxing Day’s game against Newcastle at least – as “massive”, with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt also injured.",
      "Massive just about covers it. The January transfer window is just around the corner, but Amorim has already warned against panic-buying to find cover for their skipper. “I will see what we’re going to do,” Amorim said post-match. “I think Kobbie Mainoo is out and Bruno is out. So we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses. We need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.",
      "“What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes. I’m not going to get [together] with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox] and [chief executive] Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan. If we have to suffer, the club comes first.”",
      "What is that plan? Well, Amorim is at least boosted by the return from suspension of Casemiro, who sat out of the 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign. The experienced Brazilian will no doubt return as the more defensively-minded midfielder, but the identity of his partner is unclear.",
      "Mainoo’s injury is extremely badly timed. The 20-year-old has been frustratedly sitting on the bench all season and the moment an opportunity comes, he is unavailable. Amorim has said he sees Mainoo as a more attack-minded midfielder and he might have been a good fit for the Newcastle game.",
      "A look at United’s first-team squad on their own website shows just how thin on the ground they are right now. With Fernandes and Mainoo injured and Toby Collyer and Dan Gore away on loan, that leaves Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount as the only fit first-team midfielders.",
      "Choosing two of those three looks straightforward, with Mount the best replacement for Fernandes. The former Chelsea man has tended to play as one of the No.10s in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation, but can drop back into the midfield two and has the creative instincts to push forward.",
      "Ugarte, meanwhile, is completely lacking in such instincts and has been an underwhelming flop since making a £50million move from Paris Saint-Germain in August 2024. Shockingly, United have not won any of the last nine league games in which Ugarte has started.",
      "Amorim turned to Lisandro Martinez to play the second half in midfield against Villa and the returning Argentina international did a reasonable job. But the defender clearly isn’t a like-for-like replacement and can’t play alongside Casemiro; instead he could return in defence, perhaps in place of Ayden Heaven.",
      "The final option for Amorim comes from the academy – an area he has been accused of ignoring since arriving over a year ago. Indeed, Amorim referenced Sunday’s two debutants as options at Villa Park: “I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.”",
      "Lacey is a wide forward who showed a glimpse of his talent by cutting inside off the right onto his left foot and getting a shot off against Villa. Fletcher – the son of ex-United midfielder Darren Fletcher – is a central midfielder who could earn more minutes in the coming games. But throwing him into the starting line-up against Newcastle’s Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton is a big step up and one Amorim is unlikely to take.",
      "Moving Mount back into midfield alongside Casemiro seems the most sensible option for now, even if it leaves an issue further forward, with Mbeumo and Amad away. Lacey, 18, would appear to be competing with Joshua Zirkzee for a starting berth.",
      "Potential Man Utd line-up vs Newcastle: Lammens; Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Mount, Dorgu; Zirkzee, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "They have been linked with signing a new central midfielder after failing to persuade Brighton to part ways with Carlos Baleba in the summer. The club have since been linked with the likes of Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson.",
      "But Antoine Semenyo has been the most prominent name ahead of the January transfer window. The Bournemouth star has a £65million release clause and has the interest of Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, and United.",

      "\"You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",
      "Amorim's comments come days after suggesting United may have some financial backing for January. On that occasion, he emphasised any deal would benefit a prolonged period rather than cover for the club's AFCON losses.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",

      "Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes is set to be sidelined for at least a month after picking up an injury during his team's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. The Portuguese midfielder was visibly struggling throughout the opening 45 minutes, with a substitution forcing him off at half-time.",
      "Now, according to The Telegraph, the club captain suffered a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", forcing him to be withdrawn at the interval at Villa Park. Fernandes' injury couldn't have come at a worse moment for United, with key players Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all currently away representing their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations over the coming weeks.",
      "This has already left Ruben Amorim working with a depleted squad, something that was apparent in his reliance on younger talent during Sunday's disappointing result, as he called on the likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher from the bench. Losing Fernandes represents a massive setback, particularly given his vital contribution to their recent improved performances, netting five times and providing seven assists from his deeper midfield position.",
      "Discussing the injury following the match, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see. It's an injury and sometimes it's bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game. No one is going to remember these problems, so let's cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo might finally get his moment, following demands from supporters across all corners for the youngster to be handed his opportunity, as well as the public t-shirt stunt from his brother. The academy star is yet to start a Premier League match this campaign, despite having already demonstrated his capabilities at the top - featuring for England as well as scoring an FA Cup winner for United.",
      "Mainoo was missing from the Villa Park defeat due to a minor knock sustained during training, preventing him from being the immediate replacement for Fernandes on Sunday, though he could feature in the Boxing Day encounter with Newcastle United. “I will see,\" Amorim responded when asked if the midfielder could feature in the coming week.",
      "\"I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, but we will see. We are going to find solutions. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we are going to try to win the next game.”",
      "With another fitness concern emerging, Amorim faces some crucial fixtures over the coming weeks that may see the skipper sidelined. Given United's final realistic shot at silverware lies in the FA Cup, losing Fernandes for the upcoming Brighton fixture could prove devastating, alongside his potential absence for clashes against rivals including Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "Fernandes has been typically reliable for minutes since joining United in 2020, with this being a rare occasion where he will miss out. The club captain already has over 300 appearances to his name, with 103 goals and 93 assists, showing how huge his absence could be.",
      "That said, it could be a peak into a post-Fernandes world for United and Amorim, just days on from an interview on his future. \"I've always said that I want to remain in a place for as long as I'm wanted,\" he said.",
      "\"The moment I feel that I'm not 100% wanted, then I will talk to the club and say that I want to leave. I would like to try the Spanish league because I've never played in Spain. I would like to play for one of the clubs in Italy that competes for big aims like the league title, especially because I really enjoyed living in Italy.\"",

      "Spanish media have reached a verdict after Marcus Rashford was dropped to the bench for Barcelona's win over Villarreal on Sunday. The on-loan Manchester United forward was benched by Hansi Flick, having started a cup tie in midweek.",
      "The reigning La Liga champions are putting up a valiant defence of their crown and faced Villarreal away from home in their latest league tie. Rivals and second-place Real Madrid had played on Saturday, beating Sevilla 2-0.",
      "Rashford's side faced a difficult task when they travelled to Estadio de la Ceramica, and head coach Flick preferred to hand Raphinha a starting role instead of the Englishman. This decision paid dividends as the superstar Brazilian opened the scoring after 12 minutes before Lamine Yamal's clincher just after the hour mark.",
      "Media outlets in Spain have now had their say regarding Rashford, who came off the bench in the 63rd minute in place of Fermin Lopez and enjoyed some space out wide.",
      "Rashford had a few shots on goal in his time on the pitch, but his biggest moment came in the 89th minute. He was played in one-on-one with the goalkeeper but his chipped effort was cleared off the line by Sergi Cardona.",
      "Marca were somewhat critical of the miss and wrote: \"Barça combined very quickly in the attacking third. Rashford was one-on-one with [Luiz] Junior, he chipped it but it was weak and allowed Cardona to collect the ball in the six-yard box.\"",
      "But their player ratings painted a different picture, describing him as \"dangerous.\" They also said: \"He came on in the 62nd minute. The Englishman always gives the impression of being very dangerous and only Cardona prevented him from scoring.\"",
      "The decision to supplant United loanee Rashford with the now-fit Raphinha was hailed by outlet Sport, who give the 28-year-old a lot of credit but believe his counterpart adds something extra.",
      "Sport wrote: \"No one can complain about Rashford's performance during Raphinha's absence [midweek], but the truth is the Brazilian provides an extra dimension defensively and has an essential work rate.\"",
      "They rated Rashford a 7/10 for his performance from the bench against Villarreal though and were in agreement that he was a dangerous player once introduced.",
      "Sport added: \"He's much more comfortable with space, exploiting it with long runs and powerful dribbles. He was generous in switching flanks and constantly offering solutions, always at the service of the team. His commitment and dedication were complete.\"",
      "This outlet also saw eye-to-eye with others and had nothing but praise for Rashford and how he played. AS also singled out Rashford's speed and powerful dribbling as defining attributes. They wrote: \"He used his power and speed to do a lot of damage from the left flank.\"",
      "AS continued: \"To begin with, the German manager substituted Fermín and Ferran [Torres] in the second half, bringing on [Robert] Lewandowski and Rashford. That's what happens when you have that kind of squad depth.",
      "\"But it wasn't either of those two players who decided the match. It was Lamine Yamal who pounced on a series of rebounds in the Villarreal penalty area to score the second goal that sealed the victory.\"",
      "Rashford was hailed as a \"potential game changer\" by Mundo Deportivo who like most of the media in Spain only took positives from his appearance off the bench.",
      "Using one word to sum up his match, they wrote: \"Refreshing.\" They added: \"His speed was his best asset. [Tajon] Buchanan had to grab him during a run, which earned him a yellow card.",
      "\"He had a clear chance to score, but his finishing wasn't quite there. He gave the team an attacking spark. We can't forget Raphinha's sensational performance too, as he brings speed, pressure and infectious intensity to Barça.",
      "\"And we can't forget Lamine, who tries everything and scored a goal that provided some breathing room in a crucial match for this league campaign, even though it's still only the first half of the season.\"",

There's too many players, like Dalot, that just don't do enough.",

      "Gary Neville believes Manuel Ugarte was rescued by teammate Ayden Heaven on two occasions during the early stages of Manchester United's Premier League match with Aston Villa. The Red Devils travelled to Villa Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "During the opening exchanges in the West Midlands, Morgan Rogers threatened to break the deadlock on several occasions, before ultimately doing so just before the interval with a strike from distance into the far corner.",
      "Before the breakthrough, the hosts' most promising opportunities arose from careless possession in the midfield, particularly from Ugarte. He required assistance from his colleagues on multiple occasions, with Heaven producing an impressive early showing, alongside goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "\"The problem with having Manuel Ugarte in a deep-lying position is that he's not very good on the ball, and there is an example of it. Ayden Heaven just gets that second block in that's absolutely crucial.\"",
      "Thankfully for United, despite going a goal down, Matheus Cunha dragged Ruben Amorim's team back onto level pegging just moments after they had fallen behind. Matty Cash lost possession in a precarious area to Patrick Dorgu, and the ball eventually found its way to Cunha, who confidently slotted it into the far corner from close range.",
      "They were not level for long, though. Rogers scored his and Villa's second just before the hour mark.",
      "In the aftermath of that goal, Ugarte made way for Joshua Zirkzee. That was part of a double substitution that saw Jack Fletcher come on to make his debut, replacing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Ugarte's withdrawal also came soon after the midfielder received his first yellow card of the season. He was starting just his fourth match of the season, and first since the 3-1 loss to Brentford in late September.",
      "United desperately needed three points to maintain their pursuit of Chelsea and Liverpool in the battle for top-four qualification. Victory would have drawn them level with their competitors on points after 17 matches.",
      "Villa, however, had been in exceptional form recently and arrived on the back of a nine-match winning streak heading into the weekend's fixture. Their most recent loss came at Anfield against Liverpool towards the end of November.",
      "However, they had subsequently defeated teams including Arsenal, Bournemouth, and West Ham United. It came as little surprise, then, that Unai Emery's outfit sought to establish an early tempo against Amorim's charges and exploit Ugarte.",

      "Cunha had already tied the score just before half-time, shortly after Morgan Rogers had given Villa the lead. However, United's inability to handle their hosts allowed the Englishman to restore the lead at 2-1 with just 32 minutes remaining.",
      "Shortly after, United's No. 10 was given another opportunity to secure a second equaliser. With plenty of space in the six-yard box, Cunha misdirected a header into the ground and it bounced off target.",
      "\"[It] had to be a goal. It's an absolutely brilliant pass from [Mason] Mount and a wonderful cross from [Patrick] Dorgu. On a plate.",
      "\"He's got no excuse, Cunha, he has to score.\"",
      "The Brazilian appeared devastated that he hadn't managed to capitalise on the opportunity, lying face down on the pitch until his teammates came to lift him up both physically and metaphorically.",
      "Following his miss, United were still unable to mount a successful comeback in the remaining time and thus lost the chance to draw level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea following their stumble at Newcastle United over 24 hours earlier.",
      "Roy Keane, commenting at full-time, added: \"This is where football drives you mad.",
      "\"Absolutely brilliant delivery, as soon as it leaves his foot you're thinking [this is going to be a goal], and then there's no logic to it. We can't even explain it.",

      "\"Sometimes for a player it is too easy. On target and it's a goal. Another big moment for United.\"",
      "United's troubles were added to with captain Bruno Fernandes in visible discomfort with his hamstring before the half-time break. The midfielder was eventually substituted for Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Amorim has since stated he will wait on a full analysis of the problem, though is already certain he does not wish to dip into January's transfer market as a means to remedy any long-term issues.",

      "Bruno Fernandes is facing an injury lay-off after title-chasing Aston Villa made it 10 straight wins. Manchester United captain Fernandes went off at half-time which is a huge worry for Ruben Amorim as they suffered a rare defeat at Villa Park.",
      "Incredibly, it was only Villa's second win in 27 Premier League home games against United as Morgan Rogers' spectacular double put Unai Emery's men back to within three points of leaders Arsenal.",
      "But it was a bad day for United with Amorim now concerned that Fernandes - who has missed just 17 games in five years since arriving in 2020 - will be out while he also expects Kobbie Mainoo to miss the Boxing Day fixture with Newcastle United.",
      "United boss Amorim, who said Mainoo missed the Villa game after suffering a calf injury, added: \"It's a soft tissue, I think he's going to lose some games, I don't know for sure. Let's see. I don't know. I don't what to talk about matters you can't control.",
      "\"He is a guy who is always fit, so he might recover quite well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out. We will see. No excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.",

      "Amorim went on to address United's wider injury problems, having called on two academy graduates for their debuts in the second half. \"It is really strange,\" the Red Devils boss explained.",
      "\"During this year, especially at this time, we have so many problems, but we have to cope with that. I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",

      "Unai Emery tore off his coat, swirled it above his head and then threw it away in sheer delight. Villa Park was alive, the noise was deafening as the home fans stood together to cheer another unforgettable moment from Morgan Rogers.",
      "There have been a few this season but his first of two pieces of magic in one game underlines why Emery’s Aston Villa are in the thick of this title race. No wonder Emery was excited.",
      "It is now 10 straight wins in all competitions for Villa and, even more incredibly, it was only their second win over United in 27 Premier League games at Villa Park. They are a team blitzing records.",
      "It also showed why England boss Thomas Tuchel rates Rogers so highly and the Villa forward is making a very strong case to start the World Cup even ahead of his boyhood pal Jude Bellingham. Rogers was exceptional and, most importantly, he stepped up when Villa needed him most because they were not at their best and could count themselves rather fortunate to win.",
      "Manchester United played well in large parts of the game but they lacked the game-changing, defining moments of brilliance which are supposed to be in the club’s DNA. Matheus Cunha drew them level with a brilliant, clinical finish but then missed an absolute sitter to get United a second equaliser.",
      "Even more worryingly, Bruno Fernandes went off at half-time after stretching out his leg and if he is out for any time then you fear for a United team already missing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad who are away on AFCON duty. You might have thought it could be a chance for Kobbie Mainoo but he missed the trip to Villa Park because of a calf injury.",
      "A cynic might be suspicious that his absence came just a few days after his brother wore a “Free Kobbie Mainoo” T-shirt in protest at his continued absence from the United starting line-up. But surely no manager would cut off their nose to spite their face.",
      "Ruben Amorim also needs every bit of help he can get. Another blank for £74m striker Benjamin Sesko who has yet to get going at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim cut a frustrated figure as he threw on youngsters Shea Lacey and also Jack Fletcher - son of ex-United midfielder Darren who is still on the staff - for his senior debut. But even as Villa tired, United just could not find a way back.",
      "Rogers reigned supreme again as he just looks unstoppable right now. For club and country.",
      "Is Morgan Rogers currently the best player in the Premier League? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "His first goal lit up the whole game because after Villa’s fast start, it had faded away. Then Rogers struck. John McGinn sent over a long ball, Rogers’ heavy touch nearly let it run out of play but he showed all his pace and determination to keep it in.",
      "Rogers then darted in from the left wing, cut inside and then curled a sensational shot into the top corner to give Villa the lead on 45 minutes. But, within three minutes and deep into first half injury time, United levelled.",
      "Matty Cash found himself under pressure, Patrick Dorgu got a touch to Cunha who steadied himself and then made a smart finish into the far corner. Villa were ahead again after 57 minutes.",
      "Youri Tielemans put the ball across, Ollie Watkins could not control it and then Rogers latched on and curled another brilliant shot into the far corner. Another Christmas cracker from Rogers. Sheer brilliance. Somehow Cunha headed wide from Dorgu’s cross to level again and Villa held on.",
      "United will play worse and win. This was not a day for an Amorim crisis but it was a game which highlighted the reliance on Fernandes, a growing list of absences and also Sesko’s continual struggles. In contrast, after Villa’s worst start in 28 years which left them in utter disarray, they now have an incredible and wonderful momentum.",

      "Morgan Rogers was the star of the show as Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park. The victory makes it 10 in a row for Unai Emery's side, who are keeping pace with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top.",
      "A special strike from Rogers opened the scoring on the brink of half-time. But it was quickly cancelled out by Matheus Cunha in rather fortuitous circumstances after an early Christmas present from Matty Cash.",
      "With Bruno Fernandes going off injured at the interval, United were weakened and Rogers took advantage by scoring his and Villa's second goal before the hour mark. Ruben Amorim's toothless attack were unable to draw level and saw their four-game unbeaten run come to an end.",
      "Here are five talking points from Villa Park.",
      "With Casemiro suspended, there was a good chance that Kobbie Mainoo would finally start his first Premier League game of the season. But when team news was confirmed, the 20-year-old was conspicuous by his absence.",
      "As it turns out, Mainoo injured his calf during training on Saturday and it wasn't some form of punishment by Amorim. A storm erupted this week after Mainoo's half-brother wore a t-shirt to Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth emblazoned with the text 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "Who else to open the scoring? Rogers has now scored six goals in his last six league games since the November international break.",
      "His luscious effort to break the deadlock against the run of play was the pick of the bunch, too. Collecting the ball on the left flank, Rogers glided inside and took on Leny Yoro before unleashing a curling strike into Senne Lammens' top-right corner.",
      "United's goalkeeper didn't even move. For Rogers' second, he beat Yoro again and produced a similar albeit less spectacular strike which Lammens had no chance of stopping.",
      "It'll take something unwelcome or someone special for Rogers not to be starting for England at the World Cup. Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham have their work cut out.",
      "United probably owe Cash a Christmas card. In May, his weak backpass led to Emi Martinez's sending off in a moment that changed the course of the teams' last meeting, a 2-0 win for the Red Devils.",
      "This time, the Poland international dawdled on the ball and was caught by the pressing of Patrick Dorgu. The ball fell kindly to Cunha, whose first-time finish ripped past Martinez.",
      "United, who'd dominated parts of the first half, were level just three minutes after conceding. But there was a concern, with Bruno Fernandes clutching his hamstring on multiple occasions before the break.",
      "It's not often you see Fernandes nursing an injury and even rarer to see him being substituted because of one. But a hamstring problem forced United's captain off at half-time and he was replaced by Lisandro Martinez, brought on to play in an unconventional midfield role.",
      "The Red Devils had less of a goal threat with the enforced changed, perhaps a sign of things to come. With the always hectic festive period ahead, and with both Bryan Mbeumo and Amad at the Africa Cup of Nations, Fernandes' prolonged absence would be sorely felt.",
      "A lot has been said about the Red Devils' academy in recent weeks, much of it by Amorim. But the United manager put his faith in youth by firstly subbing on Jack Fletcher, the son of ex-United star Darren.",
      "There was another debut soon after, as the highly rated Shae Lacey entered proceedings in the closing stages. But there were no dream debuts, as Villa saw out the win.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has handed Manchester United an injury blow during his side's game at Aston Villa on Sunday, coming off with a hamstring complaint.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were in desperate need of a result heading into Sunday's clash at Villa Park, not least to keep the pace with top four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea. A win in the Midlands would take them level on 29 points, while a draw would leave them two points adrift.",
      "It was a lively start to the game, with Villa close to scoring through Morgan Rogers on occasion. United also had chances through Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The deadlock was eventually broken on the brink of half-time as Rogers did get his goal, cutting inside and firing a rocket into the net from just inside the box. But Villa's lead was short-lived as United got back on level terms almost instantly as Matty Cash was dispossessed close to the United goal and Cunha found the far corner.",
      "It can be argued the scoreline was the least of United's concerns, however, as captain Fernandes appeared to pull up late in the first-half. He was able to play on until the whistle, but was clearly in some discomfort as the players made their way to the dressing room.",
      "Therefore, it was no surprise to see Amorim make a change at the break. There were limited options on the bench, with both Joshua Zirkzee and Lisandro Martinez the only two senior outfield players available.",
      "It was Martinez who got the nod, with Fernandes then pictured with his coat on making his way back to the bench before kick-off. It was a bitter flow for the Red Devils as their captain has arguably been one of their most consistent performers this term.",
      "Interestingly, pundit and former United defender Gary Neville was a little surprised by Amorim's decision to take a more defensive approach with his change. Speaking on commentary, he questioned why it was Martinez instead of Zirkzee who was called upon for the second 45 minutes.",
      "\"I am surprised because I thought Zirkzee would come on just because he is closer to Bruno's position,\" Neville argued. \"I am quite surprised.",
      "\"Zirkzee doesn't look like he is too happy with it either, but you can see there now Martinez has gone in there alongside (Manuel) Ugarte in central midfield. He played there for Ajax a few times as well, United now have a back five and Ugarte and Martinez in front.",
      "\"It was a real shock to see Bruno pull up with his hamstring because he is ever present and hardly misses a game.\"",
      "It took a little over ten minutes into the second half, but Villa were able to restore their lead to make it 2-1. Rogers, once again, found the net for the hosts with another curled effort into the far corner."

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic played under four different managers during his Old Trafford spell. Jose Mourinho brought him to Old Trafford, but it was the Portuguese's successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who Matic believes was dismissed too early.",
      "Solskjaer replaced Mourinho in December 2019, initially on an interim basis before being appointed permanently. He was the second United boss of Matic's five years at Old Trafford, eventually losing his job in 2021",
      "Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick spent time in interim charge after Solskjaer's dismissal, which came after a 4-1 loss at Watford left United seventh in the Premier League. Reflecting on the Norwegian's stint four years later, though, Matic argued United pulled the trigger too soon.",
      "“We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren’t happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly,\" Matic told FourFourTwo",
      "“I think Ole deserved more time – and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.",
      "“Of course, they made the decision to sack Ole based on his final couple of results, but he was an amazing person with the right profile for the club. He and his assistants understood football – training was perfect and had every little detail ready for us.\"",
      "Matic praised Solskjaer, in part for how he was able to keep players on board even when they weren't playing regularly. The Serbian started just four of United's 12 league games in his final season, but recognised the manager was someone who knew the club.",
      "Matic would go on to leave Old Trafford in the summer of 2022, linking back up with Mourinho at Roma. He then spent time in France, playing for Rennes and Lyon, and is now back in Italy with Sassuolo.",
      "Solskjaer took time out after leaving United, eventually ending his exile from management when he took over at Besiktas midway through the 2024/25 season. He was dismissed by the Turkish club in August, though, and spoke in November about a potential return to the dugout.",

      "Manchester United's skipper Bruno Fernandes reportedly has a release clause in his contract that is only applicable to clubs outside the Premier League. Since joining from Sporting in January 2020 for just under £50million, the Portuguese midfielder has become a key player for the Red Devils.",
      "He was appointed captain by ex-manager Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has since racked up over 300 appearances for the club. Under the guidance of Ruben Amorim this season, Fernandes has netted five goals and provided seven assists in his 17 outings across all competitions.",
      "His importance to the team is undeniable, but there was a chance he might not have been at Old Trafford this season if certain members of United's top brass had their way last summer.",
      "Earlier this month, Fernandes dropped a bombshell, revealing that some were trying to push him out of the club during the previous transfer window after a hefty offer came in from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Despite the prospect of a significant salary increase, Fernandes chose to stay at Old Trafford, with Amorim also keen to retain him, despite apparent opposition from higher up.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he recently confessed to Canal 11. \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, I always play, good or bad.",
      "\"I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Following the interview, which has once again cast doubt over Fernandes' future at Old Trafford, it has now come to light that the midfielder may have an exit clause written into his deal.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, the clause can only be activated by clubs outside England. \"There is a release clause in the contract of Bruno Fernandes,\" Romano revealed in his latest YouTube video.",
      "\"And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It's only for clubs abroad. It is slightly over €60million (£52.5m). So, nothing is imminent.",
      "\"Nothing is happening. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on the interest from Saudi because I think from Saudi, they can return for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Then it's going to be up to Bruno, up to Man Utd again. Let's see what's going to happen before or after the World Cup.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United are gearing up for Sunday's Premier League clash against Aston Villa. A triumph in the Midlands will bring them on par with Liverpool and Chelsea, each holding 29 points.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has not ruled out January transfers for Manchester United and only wants players who can strengthen his team even after Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON. That is not always a simple task, but it could help the Portuguese coach kick on this season.",
      "United could go into Christmas in fifth place with a victory over Aston Villa, and new signings could offer a timely boost for Amorim, having already strengthened his squad in the summer with Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. Perhaps other areas now need attention.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said when asked if money was available for the transfer window. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Antoine Semenyo may be top of the agenda, given the opportunity his £65million release clause provides. The Bournemouth star favours a move to Liverpool, but already met Amorim last summer.",
      "The Portuguese coach is interested in fielding Semenyo as a wingback should he arrive and is said to be unconvinced by his current options. That could see an aggressive set of wingbacks in Amad and Semenyo, when the United boss returns to his favoured formation.",
      "The duo would flank a back three of Leny Yoro , Mathhijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez, who would play in front of Senne Lammens. Luke Shaw would be a stiff contender for a spot, but Martinez's passing may give him an edge.",
      "United's midfield could see further additions, with the centre of midfield a priority area for the club. The Guardian reports that Ruben Neves is an option as his contract in Saudi Arabia winds down.",
      "Neves, 28, would cost in the region £20m but could bring significant wage demands after commanding £350,000-a-week. Conor Gallagher could prove to be an alternative option, while it is claimed United are interested in Bournemouth ace Tyler Adams.",
      "Neves would be a strong candidate to start alongside Bruno Fernandes and to keep possession ticking. Tyler Adams may offer more robustness, but is out injured currently, and a second midfield addition may only open the possibility of Old Trafford exits.",
      "A fron three was decided by United's significant summer business. Mbeumo and Cunha will provide plenty of support for Sesko if he can keep Mason Mount of the side.",
      "Possible United lineup: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Neves, Fernandes, Semenyo; Mbeumo, Sesko, Cunha.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Germany star Karim Adeyemi will be hit with a fine by Borussia Dortmund following his reaction to being substituted against Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday. The 23-year-old has been linked with a Premier League switch, making it clear he favours Arsenal over Manchester United, but for now remains at Signal Iduna Park",
      "Controversy has followed Adeyemi around of late. The forward, who is represented by Jorge Mendes, recently issued an apology after being fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons (a knuckeduster and a taser), claiming they arrived in a ‘mystery box’ he ordered online.",
      "Adeyemi has six goals and three assists to his name this season, and has either started or come off the bench in every one of Dortmund's Bundesliga games. He lasted an hour against Gladbach on Friday but appeared none too happy about being withdrawn by manager Niko Kovac.",
      "Sporting director Sebastian Kehl intervened when Adeyemi attempted to walk straight down the tunnel. Speaking to Sky Germany after the game (via Yahoo), Kehl explained the situation in more detail while confirming a fine was incoming.",
      "“I told him: He’s not going to the locker room, he’s sitting there,“ Kehl said. ”The substitution was totally justified. Karim didn’t play well. He will be punished for it. I don’t want to see that reaction and neither does the coach or anyone else. It’s not right, and Karim knows that too.",
      "“We’ve discussed this issue intensively with the team in recent weeks. If a player is unhappy, he can express it in the locker room or in the next day’s training session.“",
      "Kovac, meanwhile, said the substitution was performance-based and might even have happened earlier. \"I could have made the substitution at halftime, but I didn’t want to. I wanted to give him another chance,” the Croatian said.",
      "Dortmund led early against Gladbach through Julian Brandt but had to wait until the final minute for Maximilian Beier to make the points safe. It means Kovac's side sit second heading into the winter break, albeit still some way adrift of league leaders Bayern Munich.",
      "“I’m very happy that we won. At the end of the day, it was deserved,\" Kovac said. \"We only allowed Gladbach one dangerous chance and missed one or two really good chances ourselves.",
      "\"We started well, but then didn’t do so well in the last 15 minutes of the first half. Gladbach came back a bit then. In the second half, it was an open game. We have to continue to work hard, stay focused, work together with the ball, but also against the ball. Then this team definitely have what it takes to finish in the top four.”",

      "Manchester United may have seen Alejandro Garnacho as one of the club's future stars, but the player clearly had other ideas.",
      "Chelsea snapped up Garnacho from United in August for £40 million following a breakdown in his relationship with Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim. Just over a year earlier, in December 2024, United had celebrated Garnacho after the 21-year-old winger was crowned FIFA Puskas Award winner, highlighting the club's deep appreciation for their player.",
      "Despite the affection shown to Garnacho by the Red Devils, it seems the feeling wasn't entirely mutual, with Garnacho showing no remorse about departing the red half of Manchester. The Argentine claimed the award for his spectacular goal against Everton in November 2023, when he executed a remarkable overhead kick.",
      "After the strike was recognised as the finest goal scored anywhere on the planet between August 2023 and August 2024, United made sure to praise their young talent. Their message suggested a lengthy future together lay ahead.",
      "A United statement said: \"Congratulations to Alejandro Garnacho, who is the winner of the FIFA Puskas Award for 2024. The Manchester United winger has been recognised for the stunning, acrobatic bicycle kick he netted at Everton in November 2023. Well done to our No. 17, and thanks to all those who supported him. It's a goal that we'll cherish for years to come.\"",
      "Garnacho, even followed the footsteps of his idol Cristiano Ronaldo to become only the second United player to win the award after the Portuguese superstar, is now donning Chelsea blue. Ronaldo was the first recipient of the award back in 2009 for his long-range goal against FC Porto during the 2008/09 season while playing for United.",
      "A year later, Garnacho has swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge and he's not looking back. The winger candidly admitted that his departure from United wasn't a heart-wrenching affair.",
      "He even suggested that leaving United was a necessary move for his career progression. When asked if he had any regrets, Garnacho simply responded, \"No.\" Probed further about whether he felt any sadness over how his time at United concluded, he reiterated: \"No.\"",
      "He added: \"Sometimes in life you need to change things to take a step forward or improve as a player,\" Garnacho explained. \"It was the right moment, and the right club. So it was an easy decision.\"",
      "Upon joining Chelsea, Garnacho didn't hold back in praising his new club during an interview with the official Chelsea media channel.",
      "\"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special,\" he said. \"We're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "During his time at United, Garnacho made 144 appearances, netting 26 goals and providing 22 assists. While he views his move to west London as the best decision for his career, his farewell message to United suggests he still holds some fondness for his former club.",
      "Garnacho, who has netted four goals and provided two assists in 18 appearances for Chelsea, said: \"After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my team-mates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had. I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what's to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",

      "Sunday, December 21, 2025, will forever be a special day for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey, regardless of Manchester United's defeat at Aston Villa. The 18-year-olds will never forget their professional debuts, especially coming for United on a big Premier League stage.",
      "It's an interesting time for two academy graduates to be adding their names to a historic list of youngsters making the step up to the first team as well. Ruben Amorim threw them both on at Villa Park with resources stretched to breaking point, and he did so having been critical of the academy in recent weeks.",
      "The relationship between Amorim and those nurturing the stars of the future could be strained after recent comments, with the head coach not always giving the impression he was happy with the quality or the attitude of those being developed.",
      "However, in the West Midlands, he demonstrated that he was still willing to turn to them when needed. Fletcher came on with 17 minutes remaining and Lacey got the final six minutes, having been an unused substitute on four occasions recently. Both can be happy with their brief cameos.",
      "There could be more opportunities to come. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day, but United will be without seven first-team players, with Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo all set to be out. That could hand more squad places to academy kids.",
      "As good as Fletcher and Lacey might be feeling this morning, however, they have been warned that making their debuts is far from the end of the road and after Amorim's recent comments, they will know hard times could be ahead as well. Even for the best players, the path is very rarely smooth.",
      "That is the point Amorim made a week ago when he cited the debuts handed out to Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, who played for United at the ages of 18 and 17, but now find themselves going through different periods. Amass is playing well for a struggling Championship side and Chido is having a more difficult season at academy level.",
      "Both players reacted badly to those comments, posting photos on Instagram of successful moments in recent months, only to then delete them. Amorim was unflinching in his criticism last week, but made the valid point that it can be dangerous to cosset young players and that sometimes they need to go through tougher spells as part of their development.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids,\" he said. \"We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "Those are words that Fletcher and Lacey should remember. A month from now, the injured players are likely to return, and the Africa Cup of Nations trio of Mazraoui, Amad, and Mbeumo will be back. With a fully fit squad to pick from, Amorim won't be calling on Fletcher or Lacey.",
      "They have had a taste of first-team football for one of the world's biggest clubs, but very soon they will be playing academy football again or having a loan spell in the EFL. When that happens, they should take Amorim's comments on board. They have enjoyed a memorable day in their young careers, but the hard work has barely even begun.",

      "Manchester United are unlikely to sanction a January departure for Joshua Zirkzee until their injury crisis has eased or key players have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations. Roma are keen to sign the forward next month as Gian Piero Gasperini looks to strengthen his attacking options.",
      "A deal isn't thought to be as advanced as reports in Italy have suggested over the previous 24 hours, but the Serie A giants are keen to sign Zirkzee during the window as they explore a loan or permanent deal. Even if a move was to accelerate, United are reluctant to lose an attacking option at a point when their resources are so stretched. Zirkzee came on for the final 17 minutes against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "United lost Kobbie Mainoo to a calf injury in training on Saturday and then saw Bruno Fernandes limp off at half-time at Villa Park. Both players will miss the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle and while there is hope Mainoo could be fit for the clash with Wolves, Ruben Amorim expects Fernandes to miss a few games.",
      "That is a blow when he is already without attacking options in Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, who are away with the Ivory Coast and Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). It means the only true attacking options available to Amorim are Zirkzee, Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo's absence will depend on how far their nations get in AFCON, but they are both among the favourites and the final weekend of the tournament is played on January 17 and 18. Amorim will give an update on Fernandes' fitness at his press conference on Christmas Eve to preview the clash with Newcastle.",
      "United are working on an attacking signing in January as they eye up a move for Antoine Semenyo. The Bournemouth forward has a £65million release clause in his contract, but United face competition from Manchester City and Liverpool for the 25-year-old.",
      "That clause is only active in the first couple of weeks of the window, so any deal could happen quickly. Should United land Semenyo, it could also free up the possibility of Zirkzee then joining Roma.",
      "Zirkzee, 24, has struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford since his £36.5million move from Bologna in July 2024. He has managed just eight goals and three assists in 60 games for the club and has started just 17 Premier League games.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim defended Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Benjamin Sesko after the team's 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa. United left Birmingham empty-handed on Sunday following two goals from Morgan Rogers.",
      "Yoro gave Rogers yards of space for the opening goal of the game, and he was at the scene of the crime again when the in-form England international fired his side back into the lead. Heaven was tested against the experienced Ollie Watkins, while Sesko missed two chances in quick succession in the first half on his first start since recovering from a knee injury.",
      "Discussing Sesko in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: \"He is returning to competition, really fast, he is going to improve a lot, the idea was 70-75 [minutes], he stopped for a while, we are trying to help the players.\"",
      "When discussing whether United conceded similar goals at Villa Park, Amorim defended Yoro and Heaven, saying: \"Sometimes we can suffer goals and concede. When you want to press and they kick the ball, Rogers can go both sides, it is really hard to defend a player like that one against one.",
      "\"We had some games against Nottingham Forest, Ayden [Heaven] and Leny [Yoro] defend one against one most of the time, Luke Shaw is the same. It is not just if you suffer goals, but the way. Sometimes the details can change the narrative.\"",
      "United had the opportunity to move up to fifth in the table with a victory against Villa, but they will head into the Boxing Day game against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the league.",
      "Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury in the first half of the game. \"I think it's soft tissue so it's going to be a while. We'll see,\" the United boss said.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could return to face Newcastle, he added: \"Kobbie Mainoo is out, Bruno is out, so we'll see. No excuses, we'll try to win the next game.\"",

      "The January transfer window is fast approaching and Manchester United could be one of the busiest Premier League clubs over the next month.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are expected to dip into the market to strengthen their squad, with Antoine Semenyo at the top of their wanted list after impressing for Bournemouth. Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool are among the others that are interested in the Ghanaian.",
      "Elsewhere, United are searching for at least one, if not, two central midfielders. The Reds tried to sign Carlos Baleba in the summer but he ended up remaining at Brighton. While Amorim's men could return for Baleba, they have also set their sets on both Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "As for outgoings, there are a number of players that could leave Old Trafford. Kobbie Mainoo is one, with the 20-year-old midfielder said to be keen on a permanent United exit. Joshua Zirkzee is another, as Roma and AC Milan continue to track his situation following a difficult start to life at the Reds.",
      "Stay tuned with the latest United transfer news and rumours throughout the morning here....",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "Italian newspaper Il Messaggero have reported that Man United would only let Joshua Zirkzee depart the club in mid to late January, when Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will be back from AFCON.",
      "AS Roma are keen to sign the forward, though they are also considering Atletico Madrid's Giacomo Raspadori. The Serie A side have put forward an inital loan fee worth €5m and an option to buy of €30m, although United are said to be keen on €50m.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Liverpool are prepared to stop pursuing Antoine Semenyo, which would put the winger in a more favourable position to sign for Manchester United.",
      "United want to bring Semenyo to Old Trafford in January but face competition from a number of Premier League rivals, with Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool said last week to among them.",
      "But if Liverpool now drop out of the race for the Ghana international, it would give United a major boost to get a deal over the deal.",
      "If Antoine Semenyo were to sign for Manchester United, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has suggested his arrival would be directly linked to Joshua Zirkzee's exit.",
      "The Dutchman has been left frustrated with his lack of game time this season and in a World Cup year, he is open leaving United in January. A return to Serie A is being discussed and progress on a potential move to Roma is moving fast.",
      "Manchester United have made a 'significant effort' to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth and have presented what is described as an impressive package that includes substantial terms and a key role under Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "United are 'serious' about signing Semenyo and the club has explained its vision to the player about how he would sit into their system.",
      "According to transfer journalist Matteo Moretto, Roma want to add Joshua Zirkzee to their squad in the first week of January, and it's claimed they are 'nearing an agreement with Manchester United'.",
      "While it was previously revealed that United do not want to lose Zirkzee before January 18 due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), this date has now moved forward three days.",
      "Zirkzee is thought to have 'expressed his appreciation' for a move to Rome, with the Serie A club aiming to complete a loan transfer with an option to buy.",
      "Marcus Rashford is closing in on a permanent move to Barcelona. The Catalan club is 'inclined' on signing the 28-year-old for good once his loan move expires, according to Mundo Deportivo.",
      "Rashford has impressed since he signed for Barca on loan in July and the club are said to be pleased with his progress. He has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances so far this season.",
      "According to the Times, Brighton are not planning on selling Carlos Baleba until at least 2027, damaging Manchester United's chances of signing the Cameroon international next year.",
      "An approach from United for Baleba was rejected during the summer, and the club was informed that a bid of more than £100million was required for Brighton to even consider a sale.",
      "But Brighton are now prepared to hold on to Baleba for at least another 18 months, even if United decide to dip back into the market and attempt to sign him in 2026.",
      "Bayern Munich have been preparing to offer £43.8m for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, it has been claimed.",
      "Bayern are described as long-term admirers of Fernandes, but may need to wait to determine if he will be fit by the end of January or if they will have to postpone their plans until the summer.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer news blog on this fine Monday morning.",

      "Manchester United lost 2-1 to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday. Villa took the lead through Morgan Rogers just before half-time, but Matheus Cunha produced a practically immediate response.",
      "The score was level at the break and Bruno Fernandes was brought off after picking up an injury. Lisandro Martinez was selected to replace Fernandes and he stepped into a midfield role.",
      "Rogers restored Villa's lead in the 58th minute to claim the three points for his side.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed:",
      "Cunha hands on his head",
      "Benjamin Sesko was sent through on goal twice in quick succession in the first half and he failed to finish on both occasions. Sesko could have struck the ball quicker - that has been a recurring theme since his arrival from Germany - for the first chance, and he tried to round Emiliano Martinez for the second opportunity.",
      "It was the wrong decision from Sesko. He could have lifted the ball above Martinez if he'd decided to hit it first time, but he tried to take it beyond the goalkeeper and his touch was heavy.",
      "Cunha was responsible for playing Sesko through and he reacted by putting his head in his hands. The Brazilian's reaction said it all - he knew Sesko had wasted a massive chance to go ahead.",
      "Sesko seems to want an extra second on the ball in the box. He got that time in the Bundesliga, but the Premier League is a different beast. He must sharpen up on his decision-making.",
      "Amorim unhappy with Yoro",
      "Amorim dished out constant instructions to Leny Yoro during the Bournemouth game, and footage of one of their interactions went viral on social media. Amorim was speaking about Yoro in his mother tongue, but you did not need to speak Portuguese to work out that he was not happy with the defender.",
      "Yoro was on the receiving end of further instructions against Villa. \"Leny!\" Amorim shouted in the 14th minute, seemingly wanting him to provide width when Ayden Heaven was on the ball in the centre.",
      "Moments before, Yoro had been all over the shop when Ollie Watkins had been played through. The 20-year-old has not been at his best this season, but it's important to note that he looked settled on the left side of the back-three in the spring, and he may be getting to grips with playing on the right.",
      "The warning signs were there, and Yoro was at fault for Villa's opening goal. He gave one of the most in-form players in the league, Rogers, yards of space around the box and was punished for that mistake. Then Yoro was at the scene of the crime again when Rogers scored his second of the game.",
      "The wild Emery celebration",
      "Unai Emery reacted to Rogers' second goal by throwing his coat into the air. Amorim angrily looked at the floor, and a steward picked up the Spaniard's coat before handing it back to him.",
      "Emery's celebration helped to whip up the crowd around the dug-out. Villa Park found its voice again - the home crowd had become frustrated earlier in the game - and roared their side on.",
      "The United section could still be heard, though, chanting \"you've only come to see United\" and \"if Fletcher scores, we're on the pitch\" following the introduction of Jack Fletcher with 20 minutes remaining.",
      "United have won three times on the road in the league this term and the travelling fans deserve better.",
      "Mount tried to set the tempo",
      "Mount has described himself as the \"catalyst\" for the team's press and his energy was important on Sunday, particularly in the opening exchanges when Villa made an aggressive start to the contest.",
      "The hosts fashioned a few opportunities, and Rogers came within inches of scoring. United needed to match the tempo of the opposition, so Mount made a crunching challenge on Ian Maatsen. Mount did brilliantly to get across to Maatsen, and the execution of the tackle was perfect.",
      "The midfielder received a huge cheer from the away section. Mount was subsequently spotted giving instructions to Sesko, and he was seen pleading to the referee over something when United conceded before half time.",
      "United need more players with the same desire as Mount.",
      "Heaton's message for Lacey",
      "Amorim has copped some flak for his handling of academy players, but he introduced Fletcher and handed a senior debut to Shea Lacey with just over six minutes remaining at Villa Park.",
      "Tom Heaton passed on some words of encouragement for Lacey as he got ready to make his debut, tapping him on the chest as if to say \"go out and there and show what you can do\".",
      "Lacey received a warm reception from United fans when he stepped onto the pitch, and he could get more opportunities over the next few weeks due to United missing players at the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "Ruben Amorim insists Manchester United won't rip up their January transfer plans despite losing captain Bruno Fernandes to a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes joined fellow midfielder Kobbie Mainoo on the injury list after he withdrew on the eve of the game.",
      "Fernandes clutched his hamstring late in the first half at Villa Park and was forced off at the break, with Amorim confirming it was a soft tissue problem. Mainoo injured his calf in training on Saturday and couldn't be part of the squad.",
      "Both midfielders are expected to miss the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle when United will find resources stretched to their limit. Casemiro will return to the side after serving a suspension against Aston Villa, but the out-of-form Manuel Ugarte is the only other fit senior central midfielder.",
      "Amorim will look for solutions against the Magpies, but insisted he won't use the injuries as an excuse. Lisandro Martinez came on in midfield against Aston Villa and Jack Fletcher made his first-team debut from the bench.",
      "“It’s a soft tissue, I think he’s going to lose some games, I don’t know for sure. Let’s see,\" Amorim said of Fernandes.",
      "“I don’t know. I don’t want to talk about matters you can’t control. He is a guy who is always fit so he might recover quite well.",
      "\"I think Kobbie might be out [against Newcastle], Bruno is out, so we will see, we are going to find solutions, no excuses, we need to win the next game and we will try to win the next game.\"",
      "United are reluctant to make a move for a short-term target in January, and Amorim has confirmed that he wants to stick to the long-term plan and wouldn't be asking director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada for a sticking plaster solution.",
      "They are set to make a move for Antoine Semenyo when the window opens, with the attacker set to leave Bournemouth next month, but a move for a midfielder might have to wait until the summer.",
      "\"What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes,\" said Amorim. \"And then here we go again with a lot of mistakes. I'm not going to get with Jason under Omar and I'm going to say we need a lot of players because we have a plan.",
      "\"If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in the moment that we need points, but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. Of course, you can feel that in this moment we are going to struggle, but we'll see.\"",

      "United had edged the first half but some casual defending from Leny Yoro allowed Morgan Rogers to cut inside and bend a stunning finish past Senne Lammens. The visitors were level a few minutes later. Patrick Dorgu nicked the ball off Matty Cash and Matheus Cunha found another excellent finish.",
      "The game was delivering spectacular moments and Villa found another when Rogers again whipped a brilliant finish into the top corner.",
      "Here are how the United players rated at Villa Park:",
      "Senne Lammens: Powerless to stop either goal and a solid enough game aside from that. One good first half stop from John McGinn, although might have pushed it wide of goal. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Awful for Rogers' first goal when he never made any attempt to get close to the brilliant playmaker. Looked scared to make a tackle for the second. 4",
      "Ayden Heaven: Stood up well to the challenge posed by an experienced England international. Some good moments against Ollie Watkins and edged that battle. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Saw play go down the other flank. Tidy enough in possession but didn't have an awful lot to do at times in the game. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Offered an outlet and got involved in the game but looks better on the left from an attacking point of view. Two poor, floaty crosses on his left foot. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Just not good enough in possession to hold down a place in this team. Moved further forward after Bruno Fernandes went off and looked ill-suited to that role. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Looked in trouble when he stopped the game to grab his hamstring. Still had a shot after that but his absence is going to be massive. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Settled into the game on his return to the team and looked more assured than he has done for a long time. Good work for Cunha's goal and created another chance. 7",
      "Mason Mount: Busy throughout the game. Won possession well in the first half, created a chance for Benjamin Sesko and stood up in the second half. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Again United's most dangerous player and has really come to the party over the last week. Took his goal well but should have got a second. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Wasted two good first-half chances and didn't do enough to rattle Victor Lindelof, who is normally uncomfortable against physical strikers. 5",
      "Substitutes:",
      "Lisandro Martinez: In an unfamiliar role but started well and was good on the ball. Looks a better option there than Ugarte. 7",
      "Jack Fletcher: Solid on his debut. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Quiet. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: Little time to make an impact but hit a late shot at Martinez. 6",
      "Subs not used: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson, Tyrell Malacia, Bendito Mantato",

      "Pundit Roy Keane believes Manchester United attacker Matheus Cunha \"defied logic\" during their narrow 2-1 defeat away at Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were in desperate need of three points at Villa Park in order to keep pace with their top-four rivals. The defeat means they remain seventh in the standings, a point behind Sunderland and three adrift of both Liverpool and Chelsea.",
      "Despite a promising start against Unai Emery's side, a moment of magic from Morgan Rogers on the brink of half-time broke the deadlock. United, though, reacted quickly and got themselves back on level terms just minutes later courtesy of an effort from Cunha.",
      "Rogers was the man of the moment again in the second half, producing another impressive finish just before the hour mark. Amorim’s men were ultimately unable to claw their way back once more, despite creating a handful of clear-cut chances.",
      "While the overall performance was somewhat disappointing given the result, Keane was impressed with Cunha’s work going forward. The Brazilian may have missed a glaring opportunity to level things up in the second half, but the ex-United defender has no doubts about his overall quality.",
      "\"And then he misses a sitter in the second half, which defies logic really, it's hard to see how he missed that.\"",
      "Sunday's loss was the sixth time in eight games United have dropped points. Since the beginning of November, the Red Devils have drawn four, lost two and won two in the Premier League.",
      "While they may have deserved more than defeat at Villa Park, Keane refused to buy into the idea that they were simply unlucky. Ultimately, they are giving too much away to their opposition, something that was highlighted a week prior to the Villa game in a chaotic, end-to-end 4-4 draw at home to Bournemouth.",
      "Discussing United's performance more generally, Keane added: \"I wouldn't say they were unlucky - they gave up two goals. They've conceded six goals in the last two games, and that's not good enough.",
      "\"We praise them going forward, and they are more of a goal threat, but with the amount of chances and goals they're giving up, you can't make progress. United can dig deep, they showed that again today, but they need to be more intense when they’re defending, they need more pride there.",
      "\"You can't give up six goals in two matches and expect to get results because you're making it too hard for yourselves. Out of possession, they are nowhere near good enough.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo cannot be held responsible for his brother’s decision to wear a \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" t-shirt to a Manchester United game, according to pundit Micah Richards.",
      "It has been a difficult season so far for the young midfielder, with his influence at United waning significantly under the current head coach. Having initially made a breakthrough into the first team under Erik ten Hag, eventually earning a call-up to the England squad, Ruben Amorim has since persistently opted for alternative options in midfield.",
      "Mainoo was heavily linked with a departure from Old Trafford on loan during the summer, but the club's hierarchy rejected offers for the player. They cited their belief in the academy graduate and their desire for him to stay and fight for his place at the club.",
      "Unfortunately, little has changed in the months that have followed, and game time has been hard to come by for the 20-year-old. His hopes of securing a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England World Cup squad are dwindling by the week. He has made 12 appearances in all competitions, but his minutes total a mere 302, while he is yet to start a game in the Premier League.",
      "With the January window now approaching, it is no surprise to see Mainoo once again linked with a move away from the club. It remains to be seen whether the player will get his wish, with Serie A side Napoli rumoured to still be circling, but his brother made his feelings clear over what should happen next month as he controversially opted to wear a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt to United's 4-4 draw against Bournemouth last week.",
      "\"[Amorim] used a word about players and entitlement and I don’t think it's that,\" Richards said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"And I don't think you should be judged on what a family member says or does, you know?",
      "\"Because come on, how many times when you're playing and people say 'oh, he should be playing, he should be starting' or 'the manager is missing him out' and yes it brings pressure to the club, it brings pressure to the fans and the manager.",
      "\"Whether you think his brother Jordan did the right thing or the wrong thing, that shouldn't be held against the player. The wider point on Mainoo is he should be playing more minutes and if the manager doesn't want to play him, then he has to move on. It's as simple as that. He was starting for England, was it 18 months ago.",
      "\"I think the system goes against him a little bit because he [Amorim] likes Casemiro, he's gone with [Manuel] Ugarte against Villa. Bruno Fernandes is playing more holding, so when you're challenging with Fernandes, you're not gonna get in, but he's certainly got a role to play for Man United.",
      "\"I think it would be better still if he could find a way to get into the team, just got to keep working hard, but if it comes to January and he's got no more minutes then he has to look at it, simple as that.\"",
      "Fortunately for Mainoo, Amorim shares the sentiment on it being his brother's responsibility alone and his actions will not hinder the midfielder's game time. The Portuguese coach cited an incident he experienced with his own brother at Sporting as a reason for his viewpoint on the situation.",
      "\"He's a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility,\" Amorim said to the media last week. \"He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, so I'm just focused on that.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something in the internet and I have to answer for that. My explanation is, 'He has his life, he has his opinion, it's nothing to do with me', so I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",

      "Diogo Dalot was \"happy\" for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey after the pair made their first-team debuts for Manchester United. Ruben Amorim has lost players to the Africa Cup of Nations and was without Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo at Villa Park, which meant a youthful bench was named.",
      "Fletcher was introduced in the 72nd minute to replace Benjamin Sesko. The son of former United midfielder Darren Fletcher has made huge progress in the academy and was rewarded with a debut.",
      "Lacey replaced Leny Yoro to play the final five minutes of the game. The 18-year-old has long been tipped to make a senior debut, and he was handed an opportunity by Amorim.",
      "Dalot told MUTV: \"This is the moment, we have so many players missing that this is the opportunity for those who didn't had so many chances to step up now and show why they deserve more minutes.",
      "\"I'm very happy that they could make their debuts. Hopefully in the next game they are available and can help us.\"",
      "The Portugal international also discussed the team's performance, adding: \"I think we need to find a way to win the game. The goals we conceded were moments that we could have avoided, but overall I think we did enough to get at least get a point or win.",
      "\"We created enough, we could have been more clinical, but we need to find that consistency, especially when defending our goal, to prevent us from conceding so many goals.",
      "\"It's the fine margins which decide a game, and today was one of them. These are the moments that we need to find a way to make it go to our side, not the opponent's side.\"",
      "When Amorim was asked about the two debuts, he said: \"Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",
      "\"I am a manager for six years and even Sporting is all about the academy, so it's about the history. Every manager wants to bring players through from the academy and not spend money because this gives value to the manager.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker was seen struggling through the first half of the match, with the second half seeing him replaced by Lisandro Martinez, who took up the midfield role instead.",
      "The injury for Fernandes comes as a blow to Man United at the worst possible time, with three game-changers in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all away on international duty with their respective nations for the Africa Cup of Nations over the next month or so.",
      "That has already seen Ruben Amorim dealt a depleted squad, which was evident with his reliance on younger players in the defeat on Sunday.",
      "The loss of Fernandes is a particularly huge blow, considering how crucial he has been to their recent uptick in form, picking up five goals and seven assists from his deeper midfield role.",
      "Speaking about the injury after the game, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see.",
      "\"It's an injury and sometimes it’s bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game.",
      "\"No one is going to remember these problems, so let’s cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may finally be given a chance to shine, after calls from all sections of the fanbase for the youngster to be given an opportunity.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite previously proving himself at the top level, which has raised plenty of eyebrows.",
      "Mainoo was absent from the defeat at Villa Park, due to a minor injury picked up in training, which meant he couldn't be the immediate Fernandes replacement on Sunday, but could be for Boxing Day's clash with Newcastle United.",
      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "In his absence comes a chance for someone to step up and make themselves a hero, however.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

The tournament in Morocco kicks off on Sunday with the host nation taking on Comoros. The final takes place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18.",
      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "Meanwhile, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to fall at the group stages - meaning he could be available for United again away at Leeds on January 4, should that come to pass.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "The Supercomputer also predicts that Senegal will oust Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a resounding 3-0 win. However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction reckons Amad is also likely to return at a similar time to Mazraoui for the Arsenal game in late January.",
      "In what could be the tournament's biggest upset, Egypt and their star player Mohamed Salah are predicted to fall to Comoros with a 1-0 loss in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "It’s Christmas, isn’t it? Just about? And what does Christmas mean? That’s right, recriminations and family in-fighting. But also gifts and presents.",
      "The more traditional footballing application is for defensive and goalkeeping howlers at this jolliest time of the year to be called early Christmas presents. Guglielmo Vicario has certainly embraced his designated role as this year’s Banter Santa.",
      "But there’s another way Christmas gifts can manifest. There are certain players who’ve just received one in the shape of an unexpected chance to re-assert their claims on a more significant role over the weeks ahead after recent events.",
      "",
      "To be clear from the outset, we’re not saying anyone here is wishing injury upon a team-mate. Obviously not. But one man’s setback is always another man’s opportunity, and the injury Alexander Isak suffered in the process of scoring for Liverpool at Tottenham over the weekend has certainly cleared Ekitike’s path for the foreseeable.",
      "At the very least, Isak’s apparently lengthy absence provides clarity for all concerned. The framing of the striker situation at Liverpool now becomes entirely different, with even the decision to spaff so much of their resources (time and financial) on two strikers suddenly looking less mad than it has for most of the season to date.",
      "Ekitike is now the first-choice striker for an extended period of time, and in truth it’s a deserved status based on the relative performances of him and Isak across the season. On every metric outside sunk-cost, Ekitike appears the more deserving recipient of a lengthy shot at really establishing himself as the number one number nine. Isak isn’t even a palindrome, for goodness’ sake.",
      "",
      "Christmas is a time for miracles, and truly we witnessed one at Villa Park on Sunday. No, not Aston Villa’s seventh straight Premier League win, an event now entirely expected by all, but a soft-tissue injury for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This is quite simply an event that does not occur. So alien was it that neither Bruno nor his manager even seemed to realise he’d pulled his hamstring and did nothing about what was a very obvious situation until half-time as Bruno limped around for 10 minutes in baffled confusion at this unusual sensation in the back of his leg.",
      "Bruno’s reliability is legendary. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a row for Man United. He has been at the club for 221 Premier League games and played in 212 of them. If he didn’t occasionally get himself suspended, those numbers would be more insane still.",
      "He has played well over 3000 minutes of Premier League football in each of his five full Premier League seasons. The maximum a player can rack up is 3420.",
      "So what is about to happen is simply unprecedented. Manchester United are going to play a significant number of Premier League games at what is even for them in their quiet little season a busy period. We truly don’t know what that looks like.",
      "What it definitely is, though, is a huge opportunity for Mason Mount. He has proved rather nicely over recent weeks that he can play alongside Bruno Fernandes, something that was previously extremely doubtful.",
      "But now he has the chance to prove he can actually step in as United’s string-puller-in-chief in the absence of a man who is quite simply never absent.",
      "The ramifications of how that pans out are pretty significant. For Mount, for United and quite conceivably for England. A quick look at how Thomas Tuchel has operated thus far as England manager suggests he won’t need much encouragement to turn to a player he already knows well.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "The whimsical point to make here is to wonder just how much of a gift getting more chances to perform for Thomas Frank’s Tottenham really is. The prospect of a January escape really might have been more beguiling.",
      "But it does look less likely now with Frank now having to desperately find some way to restore some kind of attacking threat to his team in the upcoming absence of the suspended Xavi Simons.",
      "The Dutchman has been far, far from perfect in his first four months at Spurs. But he has also been far, far from the biggest problem during an increasingly gloomy time that does now look like it really could be a miserable sleepwalk into actual relegation trouble in a season where, unlike last year, such a thing actually exists for real.",
      "Spurs have won only eight games in all competitions since Xavi arrived from Germany late in the window. Xavi has started every one of those eight games.",
      "If that record of being unable to win without him remains in place after the next three games, it is surely inconceivable that Frank remains in place. And the relegation threat will be very, very real indeed.",
      "Johnson has been one of the biggest losers from Ange Postecoglou’s departure. He has a particular set of skills that, more than just about anyone else in the Spurs squad, were ideally suited to Angeball.",
      "His ability to arrive late into space on one side of the penalty area as a cross arrived from the other was often underappreciated. There’s a bit of Sterling Lite about it; it doesn’t necessarily look that impressive even when it’s very effective.",
      "But if it was as easy as it looks, then more players would do it wouldn’t they? Unfortunately, creating chances isn’t really something Frank’s Spurs do. Even more so when Xavi is absent. So Johnson might be getting the most dubious of gifts; a chance to impress under conditions that set him up to fail.",
      "That, though, brings us back to the very start. At least it might hasten his departure from this godforsaken club, and that might be the best gift of all, in a way.",
      "",
      "We kind of think it might actually end up being Kai Havertz who gets the greatest gift, assuming that the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis of a return late this year or early next is accurate. And for goodness’ sake, when has the Arsenal medical team’s prognosis ever been off?",
      "But he’s not back yet, and we must accept the small chance he won’t be for a while. And there is also simply no way we’re grown-up enough to pass up the opportunity to bring a player literally called Gabriel Jesus into a feature we’ve given a lazy Christmas-based hook.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres may have scored the winning goal from the penalty spot at Everton, but he remains Floppy McFlopface. His goal returns aren’t disastrous, but nor are they anywhere near sufficient to make up for the sheer paucity of his wider contribution. These are not Erling Haaland numbers. They’re not even Richarlison numbers.",
      "Jesus is certain to start against a suddenly porous Palace in the Carabao this week and has a clear opportunity to stake a claim to start against Brighton after Christmas. It is not at all outlandish to suggest Gyokeres could be Arsenal’s third-choice striker by February.",
      "",
      "Has struggled to make a significant impression this season since his loan move from Flamengo became a permanent one. But there are just a couple of encouraging signs.",
      "He came on at half-time after a disastrous opening 45 minutes against Newcastle and things at least got a bit less sh*t from there.",
      "And after replacing the injured Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the early stages of defeat against Chelsea, he retained his starting spot against Arsenal. Could now get the chance to turn a season of frequent but generally brief cameos into something more substantial in the games ahead, most of which will be against teams who are not Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified.",
      "The bar for atrocious West Ham defending against Manchester City was set remarkably high by Roger Johnson but Max Kilman likes a challenge, so to speak.",
      "Dean Henderson slips further down a ranking he topped not long ago, while Sunderland’s stopper returns once more to the summit…",
      "With Viktor Gyokeres continuing to struggle for Arsenal, he is among a sextet of Big Six starters doomed for a prolonged snub and/or exit in 2026…",
      "Morgan Rogers is rated as the 33rd best player in the Premier League this season, so he won’t get near this XI.",
      "Manchester United lost to Aston Villa but fans are actually happy; the margins are now fine rather than gaping chasms."

      "The Red Devils signed Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5m in July 2024 as Erik ten Hag looked for attacking reinforcements.",
      "However, Ten Hag left just months later and was replaced by Ruben Amorim with the Netherlands international struggling for game time in recent months.",
      "Zirkzee was in and out the starting XI last season under Amorim but their summer reinforcements in attack have seen the Dutchman drop further down the pecking order at Man Utd.",
      "If Man Utd can get another attacker in the building over the January transfer window, it seems likely that Zirkzee will be allowed to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Giving an update, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd are unlikely to green light a deal at the start of the window with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Aston Villa 2-1 Man United: Rogers, Amorim, title deeds and rocking-horse sh*t",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “I can reveal that a meeting took place last week between Roma and the agents of Joshua Zirkzee, with further progress made in conversations this week.",
      "“Roma consider the player a top priority, and manager Gian Piero Gasperini is pushing to bring him in as early as January.",
      "“Manchester United, however, are reluctant to give the green light at the start of the window. With several absences already – including Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo heading to AFCON, Bruno Fernandes injured, and Kobbie Mainoo unavailable – United are short of options.",
      "“From the player’s side, Roma are making progress. Zirkzee is open to the move, attracted by the promise of regular football, a central role, and the chance to shine again in Serie A, where he previously impressed with Bologna.”",
      "And now Italian publication Il Messaggero has claimed that Roma have made an ‘offer’ of €5m for the loan deal in January, plus another €30m in June to make the deal permanent, while a potential €5m Champions League qualification bonus would take the deal to €40m in total.",
      "The report adds that it ‘represents an acceptable compromise (considering the €42 million paid to Bologna, plus almost €18 million in additional costs) for a player who also sat on the sidelines against Aston Villa yesterday.’",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker recently claimed that Zirkzee was “nowhere near the level” of summer signing Benjamin Sesko, who has disappointed so far this season.",
      "Parker told AceOdds.com: “He is nowhere near the level of Sesko, who is very unselfish and makes all the right runs, and we also see now how big of a gap there is between the two of them. Zirkzee is just miles away from what is expected when you play at Man United.",
      "“It’s quite ironic actually, that Zirkzee is now playing more because Sesko is injured, but I think Zirkzee would rather want Sesko to be ready and play ahead of him, so he can get his loan move away in January. He might miss out on it now because of Sesko’s injury.",
      "“I don’t like what I am seeing from Zirkzee at all. Everything about him is trying to be flashy and it just doesn’t work. He has to be frustrated, because nothing works out for him. He looks like he is frustrated, and I totally get it, but at the end of the day it is his own fault.",
      "“I am wondering at times what they actually saw in Zirkzee. Fair enough, he is alright on the ball and his touch is decent, but he is just not going to make a difference for Man United ever.”",

      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been labelled an “insufferable man” by the brother of former Red Devils team-mate Ryan Giggs over his commentary against Aston Villa.",
      "Morgan Rogers scored two brilliant goals either side of a Matheus Cunha equaliser as Man Utd lost 2-1 at Villa Park in a game they were unfortunate not to take something.",
      "Man Utd lost Bruno Fernandes to injury at half-time with Lisandro Martinez, who has only recently returned from injury, replacing the Portugal international in midfield.",
      "Neville initially suggested that Amorim shouldn’t play Martinez, who has been deployed mainly as a centre-back in his time at Man Utd, in midfield.",
      "Those comments riled the brother of Man Utd legend Giggs, Rhodri, with the Welshman branding Neville an “insufferable man” over his comments on Martinez, who has played in midfield for Ajax and Argentina before.",
      "He wrote on X: “Just commentating. It baffles me how Neville can give advice about coaching. You was terrible at that. Just commentate on the game you insufferable man.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Aston Villa 2-1 Man United: Rogers, Amorim, title deeds and rocking-horse sh*t",
      "“Management yes, but coaching no. The first comment was, ‘I wouldn’t have put Martinez in midfield’. Halfway through the 2nd half, he says Martinez has been the best player on the pitch. If he knew his football he’d know Martinez had played in that position for Ajax and Argentina.”",
      "Man Utd legend Neville was eventually impressed by Martinez’s performance in midfield and praised the Argentina international.",
      "“United are playing really well and look the more comfortable team in the first 10 minutes of the second half.”",
      "Man Utd praised Amorim’s side for a “really good performance” against Aston Villa and is excited for Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to return from the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "“Now that’s going to continue to happen whilst they don’t have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don’t have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "“What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That’s a good thing.",
      "“I’m happy that the manager is adapting to what’s happening out there because of what’s happening with AFCON, but also I think there’s an element where he couldn’t carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "“More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble – more of what we’ve seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you’ve seen here.",
      "“Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they’ve missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "“Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked – more than tweaked – and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.”",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made as many saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet following at Brighton",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 10 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham before returning to help beat Man Utd.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help him displace this fella…",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals.",
      "",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appear to know nothing of.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a penalty save at Wolves – even if he conceded it – sees the Irishman climb towards respectability.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider. And beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Since then, performing roughly as expected, even if many remain unconvinced.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper, who falls to the bottom of this ranking after conceding four at Old Trafford. United’s 3.3 PSxG was not as damning on Petrovic as Casemiro’s header that seemed to terrify the Serbian.",
      "At this festive time of giving, there are a handful of Premier League players who’ve just received a chance they might not have been expecting.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified.",
      "The bar for atrocious West Ham defending against Manchester City was set remarkably high by Roger Johnson but Max Kilman likes a challenge, so to speak.",
      "With Viktor Gyokeres continuing to struggle for Arsenal, he is among a sextet of Big Six starters doomed for a prolonged snub and/or exit in 2026…",
      "Morgan Rogers is rated as the 33rd best player in the Premier League this season, so he won’t get near this XI.",
      "Manchester United lost to Aston Villa but fans are actually happy; the margins are now fine rather than gaping chasms."

      "But we do once again find ourselves with a pretty clear favourite to become the fifth manager out on his ear this season, with Thomas Frank in big, big trouble after Tottenham’s abysmal showing in a 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest and subsequent 2-1 loss with nine (yes, NINE) men against Liverpool.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, while Scott Parker and Daniel Farke also remain in trouble and ongoing doubts around West Ham’s ability to drag themselves out of the bottom three have to raise the possibility of both the Hammers and Nuno Espirito Santo looking for a second new appointment of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Victory over Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 11 wins in 12 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves, but derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of three consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the potential novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",

      "Aston Villa ended a year in which they’ve turned Villa Park into a fortress with victory over the one team that has never had reason to fear a trip here.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ double in a hard-fought 2-1 victory keeps Villa – who were not at their best – on the tails of Arsenal and Man City at the top of the table and perhaps (but only perhaps) more significantly extends their lead over any other Champions League chaser to a chasm-like seven points.",
      "Unai Emery and his side really are on the road to something special, while there was encouragement, frustration and a brand new quandary for Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) For all but the youngest Man United fans, there will have been something uncannily familiar about this game. An away team coming to a team on a formidable winning run and throwing absolutely everything at them, arguably having the better of the game on the balance of the 90 minutes, and then going home with absolutely nothing.",
      "Old Trafford saw more games like this than any of care to remember in the 1990s and 2000s. That Villa Park is now the venue for such behaviour really is quite something. For the first time since before that era of United dominance – before the invention of football in 1992 even – Villa have won seven top-flight matches in a row. Things are happening here.",
      "",
      "2) It shouldn’t really need reaffirming about a team that’s just won seven in a row – and 11 in 12 – but Aston Villa absolutely are in a title race now right up until they aren’t. What’s happened since the late winner against Arsenal goes against all narrative tradition for the unexpected team that suddenly inserts itself into a title situation with a thunderously significant and dramatic victory over a team that in that one moment suddenly becomes a direct rival.",
      "Falling behind at West Ham last weekend could have ended the title charge as soon as it began. The visit of a Man United team that had lost to Villa here once in 30 years could have ended the title charge. But on Villa go.",
      "If we can still talk about them as we are now in nine days’ time after trips to Stamford Bridge and the Emirates…",
      "",
      "3) What’s absolutely true for now, though, is that Villa have placed themselves into a leading pack with Arsenal and City – on merit – and thoroughly distanced themselves from the chasing pack. The gap to fourth place is now seven points. It’s an astonishing position they find themselves in, especially after the way the season started with the now-infamous five-match streak without a win – four matches without even so much as a goal.",
      "Wins for Arsenal and City on Saturday denied Villa the chance to hurt them, but Chelsea’s dropped points at Newcastle offered the chance to put real distance between them and the chasing pack. Taking that chance in the manner they did must be enormously pleasing for Unai Emery and his team.",
      "",
      "4) Hardly revelatory to highlight Morgan Rogers as the star attraction here. Two stunning goals added to a collection of stunning goals this season, Leny Yoro given an absolute torrid, and a first-half trick duly repeated in the second.",
      "He is the main reason Villa’s title challenge might have some legs. Villa are a very good side expertly trained and prepared by a brilliant manager; that puts them in position to do something special. But the kind of special they’re now in position to dream of requires individual players of individual brilliance within that rock-solid framework.",
      "Villa would still be a good team without Rogers, but they wouldn’t be viable title contenders or anything like it. With the possible exception of Emi Martinez, we’re not sure that’s true of any other single player. Rogers is the difference maker for Villa, a man who produces moments like these to turn what was by their own now lofty standards a sub-par overall performance into three more points against an avowed bogey team.",
      "",
      "5) Rogers also produces these moments when they really count, too. These were his first Villa Park goals of this Premier League season, but this is more praise than criticism. All his other goals in the league this season have come in victories from behind away from home. Vital goals at vital times in the toughest situations.",
      "That applies just as much here, with both his goals sublime on their own aesthetic and technical level but also coming at vital times where Villa appeared to be second best.",
      "",
      "6) That fact will be only part of what frustrates Ruben Amorim about what was genuinely one of his more impressive games as Man United manager; for all Rogers’ brilliance with both goals they were also avoidable from a United point of view.",
      "Yoro had a desperately poor game in a generally sound United effort achieved despite great adversity. Yoro’s futile struggle to get to grips with Rogers was a key contributor to both goals, but especially the first.",
      "",
      "7) There’s no real shame in being beaten by the threat and talent Rogers possesses; but there is in apparently being unaware of its existence.",
      "With time ticking down in a first half United had rather impressively controlled, John McGinn fizzed a thigh-high pass out from midfield to Rogers on the left. His first touch was good enough to keep the ball alive but no more.",
      "Yet as Rogers buzzed over towards the touchline to retrieve it, Yoro merely ambled in that general direction. By the time Rogers had danced inside onto his right foot and curled a shot inside Senne Lammens’ far post, Yoro still hadn’t twigged what was happening. Still hadn’t got close enough to even pressure the shot, never mind actually prevent or block it.",
      "It takes nothing away from the brilliance of everything Rogers did to note he was given a bizarre helping hand by some astonishingly passive defending against Villa’s most conspicuous threat.",
      "",
      "8) And then it all happened again, in much the same way and in with the general flow of the match at that point feeling much the same. Absolutely maddening for Amorim.",
      "",
      "9) If only for the obvious reason that the United boss had got so much right. A great deal of it was firmly in ‘needs must’ territory but that is often the fire where the greatest solutions are forged.",
      "With Casemiro suspended and Kobbie Mainoo unavailable through injury, Manuel Ugarte was handed a start in United’s midfield almost by default.",
      "His jarring lack of quality on the ball remains a massive issue, and there was one conspicuous moment in the first half where Youri Tielemans picked his pocket all too easily, but he did at least perform a semi-functional destroyer’s role as the deepest point of a midfield triangle that, in the first half at least, featured Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes as its more advanced corners.",
      "",
      "10) This is not the first time in recent weeks that Amorim has moved away slightly from his trademark rigid and unshakeable adherence to 3-4-3 and it is most welcome. The acknowledgement that more bodies were needed in the middle of the park against an opponent of Villa’s quality is a sign of self-awareness. That’s a strength, not a weakness.",
      "And it worked, it really did. It might be a stretch to say United dominated the first half, but they certainly controlled it, and went in deservedly level after Matheus Cunha profited from Patrick Dorgu’s good work in for once pressuring Villa into a mistake as they looked to play through the United press.",
      "Matty Cash is so often such a reliable conduit for Emi Martinez to start such proceedings, but was badly caught out this time.",
      "",
      "11) Yet by the time of those goals at the end of the first half, another potentially seismic moment for United’s whole season had already occurred. Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury. It cannot be overstated what a big deal that is, both in its potential impact on United’s season and sheer rocking-horse-shit rareness.",
      "Fernandes is that rare player seemingly capable of just playing all the football all the time with almost no ill-effects. Indeed, he seemed so perplexed by the entire concept of doing a hammy that he was unwilling to accept it had happened. Or perhaps unaware of what that painful sensation in his leg even was.",
      "He limped and laboured on until half-time despite it being obvious to every single other person among the 40,000 inside Villa Park what had just happened.",
      "",
      "12) His half-time withdrawal marked just the third time he had failed to reach 90 minutes in a Premier League game this season. In the previous two he came off after 85 and 87 minutes.",
      "He has cleared the 3000-minute mark in the Premier League alone in each of his five full seasons at United. He has never missed more than two Premier League games in a season through injury.",
      "In all he has featured in 212 out of 221 Manchester United league games since joining in the January transfer window of 2020. It’s a remarkable effort.",
      "And if today’s injury is anything like what it looked like – and Amorim did not sound at all cheery about it post-match – then he and United could be entering whole new territory.",
      "",
      "13) Every crisis presents an opportunity, though. This freakishly unusual Fernandes setback was spectacularly ill-timed for United and Amorim. As the United boss scoured a substitutes’ bench denuded by AFCON, injuries and suspensions, he will have seen precious little option.",
      "One was Joshua Zirkzee, the only outfielder among the United replacements to have started a game in the Premier League this season. That was the obvious option, but an imperfect one for the task at hand given United were level at what is currently the toughest ground to visit in the country and had secured their foothold in the game on the back of winning that midfield battle.",
      "",
      "14) Amorim went for Plan B and Lisandro Martinez, himself on the road back from serious injury but with midfield experience from his Ajax days. He did a fine job. The orientation of the triangle altered slightly; there were now two deeper-lying points in Ugarte and Martinez with Mount more advanced.",
      "If one wanted to be mischievous, one might suggest Martinez’s 45 minutes in the role offered a more compelling case than Ugarte’s 73 before he duly made way for Zirkzee as United chased another equaliser.",
      "At the very least, Martinez has put himself into the conversation should Fernandes’ absence be a lengthy one. He might even have got himself a goal and you’d certainly be surprised now to see Amorim revert back to his previous midfield shape for future games in and around this tariff of difficulty.",
      "",
      "15) The other obvious opportunity comes for Mason Mount. His whole Man United career has been defined by Bruno Fernandes’ sheer reliability in terms of both appearances and output. Even in recent weeks when he has proved rather nicely that he absolutely can play alongside United’s star man it has been in a support-act kind of way.",
      "But with Mount playing the best football of his United career in that time and now seeing the field quite literally cleared for him, we do wonder. He’s something of a forgotten man but 2026 could yet prove a big one for him with both club and country; we know Thomas Tuchel doesn’t need much excuse to call up players he knows he can trust, and few Englishmen are more firmly inside that particular circle than Mount.",
      "",
      "16) The final word has to go to Villa, though, who have completed an extraordinary year with an extraordinary set of home numbers. In all competitions they played 27 games at Villa Park in 2025. They won 22, drew four and lost only one.",
      "Among the teams beaten here this year have been both their current title rivals, six of the other seven members in all of what we’ll reluctantly and frankly inaccurately label the Big Eight, as well as the literal best team in Europe.",
      "And it really does set up the possibility of 2026 being even more memorable."

      "Ruben Amorim‘s team were the better side for large portions of this game, but they lacked cutting edge and were punished for a couple of defensive errors.",
      "Rogers netted a remarkable solo goal to break the deadlock, but centre-back Leny Yoro did not do enough to close down the attacker.",

      "“I thought, ‘Uh oh, you could be in trouble here’, because Rogers can do that.",
      "“There’s no doubt Leny Yoro has to get out quicker, he has to make sure confronts him outside the box.",
      "“But once doesn’t, Rogers still has a lot to do and my goodness me does he do it!",
      "“They’ve been really average in this first half, Aston Villa, but Morgan Rogers is having a very special season and that is a really, really wonderful goal.”",
      "Neville added: “I’ve played that position and when you play against a special player you have to edge over, if the touch is off you need to get out close and harass him, you can’t drift.",
      "“He just ambled, Yoro, which was a big mistake.”",

      "As Ruben Amorim looked on the brink of the sack after Manchester United’s loss against Brentford in September, a key factor behind his exit would have been his blank refusal to adapt to get the best out of his squad.",
      "This same issue contributed to Man Utd‘s damaging 1-0 home loss to 10-man Everton, with his side’s attack held back by the rigid focus on the head coach’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "However, in recent weeks, Amorim has finally relented, with the tweaks to his formation and playing style bearing fruit for the Red Devils.",
      "The absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui due to the African Cup of Nations, on top of Man Utd’s issues with injuries and suspensions, have somewhat forced Amorim’s hand, but it has seen him proactively find solutions to nullify opponents and maximise the output from the players at his disposal.",
      "There was more evidence of this against in-form Aston Villa, who went into Sunday’s game on a run of nine straight wins in all competitions, as Amorim opted to match Unai Emery’s side with more bodies than usual in the middle of the pitch.",
      "Man Utd supporters would have let out an audible gulp upon seeing Manuel Ugarte in the starting XI against Villa, with the club losing all of the last six Premier League games when the £42m flop has started.",
      "Before the game, we speculated that this could be Ugarte’s final chance to prevent a January transfer, and the declining midfielder, who is desperately poor in possession, failed to take his latest opportunity.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd still won the midfield battle in the first half and dominated against a flat Villa, with Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha overpowering their opponents.",
      "READ: Who will sign Semenyo in January and what will the four rejected sides, including Man Utd, do instead?",
      "The two sides exchanged decent chances in the opening ten minutes before Man Utd took control of the game, but it was Aston Villa who took the lead.",
      "It was a goal that really came from nowhere, with man of the moment Morgan Rogers producing his latest of many stunning solo goals.",
      "Rogers left onlookers gushing just from keeping the ball in play with a couple of sublime touches following John McGinn’s well-hit crossfield pass, but he did not stop there. With the help of Leny Yoro, who Gary Neville said was “ambling” in a “big mistake” as he carelessly opted against keeping the Englishman on his weaker left foot, he drifted inside and curled home a sensational effort into the far top corner.",
      "It would have been harsh on Man Utd if they trailed at the break, and they didn’t as Matty Cash was punished for being sloppy, with Patrick Dorgy alert to challenge the right-back and set up Matheus Cunha, who clinically converted past Emiliano Martinez from inside the penalty area.",
      "Amorim cannot be faulted for his role as his changes saw Man Utd get the better of Aston Villa for large portions of the day, though he and his side are hamstrung by key players being unavailable.",
      "Their bench against Aston Villa included two goalkeepers and five youngsters, with their situation worsened by captain Bruno Fernandes appearing to pull his hamstring.",
      "Amorim stuck to his working system as Lisandro Martinez replaced Fernandes in midfield at half time, with Man Utd’s weak bench further evidenced by Joshua Zirkzee and teenager Jack Fletcher being their next two substitutions.",
      "Despite this, the game’s flow after the interval was similar to the first half as Man Utd had the better of the action, though Aston Villa’s great equaliser proved the difference.",
      "Villa are the form team in the Premier League, but they struggled to hit their usual heights against bogey team Man Utd and had to rely on the brilliance of Rogers to get them over the line.",
      "His second goal was never going to be as good as his first, but it was a strong follow-up; he latched onto a loose ball in the penalty area following good play from Ollie Watkins and Youri Tielemans and curled home into the corner of the net via another poor challenge from Yoro.",
      "Man Utd’s push for an equaliser came to no avail as Aston Villa defended strongly, with Rogers’ special brace securing their tenth win in a row that leaves them only three points adrift of the top of the table at Christmas.",
      "In the aftermath of this match, reckless media outlets will try to tell you that this loss has added fresh fuel to the ‘Amorim sack’ conversation, but on this occasion, this would be particularly unjustified.",
      "Actually, Amorim’s decisions contributed to Man Utd besting Aston Villa in every department aside from the scoreline, which warrants praise, not ridicule, given the immense form of the hosts and the sheer lack of options at the head coach’s disposal.",

      "Shaw should be a good fit for Amorim’s system due to his ability to operate in various positions, but his best days are clearly behind him as he has been a real weak link in Man Utd’s defence this term.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that “more than ten” clubs are looking to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils looking to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window, which could knock Mainoo even further down the pecking order.",
      "Amorim, much to the annoyance of the Man Utd board, publicly declared that Mainoo would be serving as a back-up option to captain Bruno Fernandes this season.",
      "That saw Mainoo seek a loan move away from Old Trafford before the end of the summer transfer window before being talked into staying by Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "After making no Premier League starts so far this season and 11 substitute appearances, Mainoo is once again looking to leave Man Utd on loan in the winter market.",
      "Mainoo’s brother came to their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth last weekend with a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ t-shirt on but Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim doesn’t hold that against the player himself.",
      "READ: Premier League player stats: Bruno Fernandes the top playmaker as Anderson shines for Forest",
      "Amorim just wants the Man Utd midfielder to kick on, he said: “He’s a shy boy, but it’s not his responsibility. He’s responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, so I’m just focused on that.",
      "“I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something in the internet and I have to answer for that.",
      "“My explanation is, ‘He has his life, he has his opinion, it’s nothing to do with me’, so I will do the same with Kobbie.",
      "“Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that it’s not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.",
      "“I remember (Cristiano) Ronaldo was on the bench, (Wayne) Rooney was on the bench sometimes. (Juan Sebastian) Veron was not playing.",
      "“I remember all the history of Manchester United and (there is) nobody this didn’t fall (to), so let’s continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.",
      "“Believe it or not, I just want to want to help the team to win and help Kobbie to be a better player.”",
      "And now Romano has revealed that there are more than ten clubs looking to sign Mainoo with the England international seeking a way out of Old Trafford on loan before the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim made clear that the shirt, ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo,’ that the brother of Mainoo, Jordan, was wearing, he didn’t see that, but he also said, I’m not going to sanction or punish Mainoo because of a shirt he was not even wearing, it was someone else from his family.",
      "“It’s not that Kobbie is going to play because of that, or he’s not going to play because of that, so no consequences. What I can tell you is that Mainoo, in his mind, still has this desire to play more, still has this intention to go on loan, still has this plan to go play, develop, grow and then return to Man Utd.",
      "“It’s an opportunity for Man Utd to have a better player in the near future. It’s an opportunity for the player to have a chance to go to the World Cup 2026 with England. So far, he has started zero games in the Premier League, and Kobbie doesn’t want to be in this situation also for the second half of the season.",
      "“We will see how the conversations will go because this story is up to Man Utd. From Napoli, they are really hoping for a solution. Napoli want Mainoo. It’s more than 10 clubs, but Napoli, after [Scott] McTominay, after Rasmus Hojlund – they are both doing very good there – hope that they can have the opportunity to get also Mainoo from Man Utd.",
      "“But this will be up to Man Utd and Amorim. So, Mainooo is waiting. Napoli are waiting. They are waiting to see what Man Utd will do. At the moment, still no sort of green light.”",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been labelled an “insufferable man” by the brother of former team-mate Ryan Giggs over his commentary against Aston Villa.",

      "It’s starting to look more when than if for Thomas Frank as Spurs head for serious relegation trouble after his moribund leadership.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Bruno Fernandes’ release clause at Man Utd stands at “slightly over €60m”.",
      "The Portugal international has often been one of the bright sparks in a difficult few years for the Red Devils under Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim could only guide Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last term and there were rumours that Fernandes could be sold last summer in order to fund a rebuild.",
      "Despite rumours of a potential £100m move, Fernandes remained at Old Trafford and has been effective again with five goals and seven assists in 16 Premier League appearances.",
      "However, Fernandes revealed earlier this week that he was “hurt” by the feeling that the Man Utd hierarchy would have gladly sold him for the right money in the summer.",
      "In the interview, the Man Utd midfielder said: “Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be. I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",
      "READ: Premier League player stats: Bruno Fernandes the top playmaker as Anderson shines for Forest",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”",
      "That has raised the possibility of a move in January for Fernandes and Romano has revealed that he has a release clause in his contract at Man Utd for €60m for non-Premier League sides.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",

      "Ryan Giggs feels there is a “massive plus” at Manchester United despite the club losing some of their key players to the African Cup of Nations in December.",
      "United played their last game with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in the squad for a while, in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday. Noussair Mazraoui was not even able to play that, with Morocco not allowing the Red Devils to pick him in the squad.",
      "The aforementioned trio have left for AFCON, with the earliest date they are likely to return the beginning of January, as the group stages end on the final day of December.",
      "Mbeumo has been one of United’s very best players this term, and the other absent players have also been of use.",
      "As such, the seventh-placed Premier League club will be somewhat worried about their fixtures without the trio, given there are a couple of tough tasks in their next two games: Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "United legend Giggs feels there’s cause for optimism despite losing three top players, though.",
      "“[Benjamin] Sesko is now back, which helps. But it’s definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it’s going to be tough.",
      "“But with Sesko coming back, [Matheus] Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "“I’m not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don’t go through the group stage, and we don’t miss them for too long.",
      "“The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that’s a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they’re playing regularly.",
      "“And now we’re starting to see the Mason Mount that we’ve seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He’s a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you’re a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.”",
      "At this festive time of giving, there are a handful of Premier League players who’ve just received a chance they might not have been expecting.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been labelled an “insufferable man” by the brother of former team-mate Ryan Giggs over his commentary against Aston Villa.",
      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has urged Kobbie Mainoo to “have patience” given his current role at the club, but admits many feel he should be playing more often.",
      "Ruben Amorim picked out one Manchester United star for particular praise following his performance in the win against Wolves on Monday night.",
      "It’s June 17 and Mason Mount is starting under Thomas Tuchel in England’s first game at the World Cup and everyone is absolutely fine with it…",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane hit out at his former club after their disappointing 1-1 home draw against West Ham United on Thursday night."

      "Monday 22 December 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Chelsea in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City are one of those clubs that are firmly in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January, with some insiders believing they are the strongest contenders for his signature.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were wiling to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open for Stefan Ortega to leave.",
      "Longer-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are the other club firmly in the running to sign Antoine Semenyo - a player of long-term interest to the club. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is one of long-term interest and the one they have been trying hard for lately - but they look increasingly likely to miss out to the competition. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "If they do not get Semenyo it does not mean Spurs will necessarily try to sign another out-and-out left-winger. It could instead be a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026."

      "Gary Neville on Ruben Amorim's change in Man Utd approach: \"I'm happy he's adapting... he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton. That would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job\"",
      "Monday 22 December 2025 06:11, UK",
      "Gary Neville feels Ruben Amorim has given himself a blueprint to move forward after a notable change in style this week - but Roy Keane remains unimpressed with \"one of the worst teams in the league\" without the ball.",
      "For the first time in his tenure, Amorim has visibly moved away from the rigid 3-4-2-1 formation he had previously stuck with both at Old Trafford and across his managerial career, displaying a level of flexibility which had previously become a bone of contention for Manchester United supporters.",
      "After deploying a hybrid back four in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth, United put on another improved display despite losing 2-1 to in-form Aston Villa at Villa Park and deserved more than they got for the second game in succession.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: \"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them.",
      "\"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.",
      "\"I'm happy that the manager is adapting to what's happening out there because of what's happening with AFCON, but also I think there's an element where he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "\"More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you've seen here.",
      "\"Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they've missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked - more than tweaked - and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.\"",
      "Keane was similarly impressed with Man Utd's attacking output, with Amorim's side only outscored by Manchester City this season, but felt that was little excuse for the ease with which they were cut apart for both of Morgan Rogers' fine strikes in their latest defeat - their fifth from 17 league games.",
      "Leny Yoro was singled out for criticism for a lack of intensity in closing down Rogers when he first received the ball before cutting inside and netting a stunning opener, while Keane was just as frustrated by Diogo Dalot's attempts to block a cross leading up to his second.",
      "\"You can have all the talent in the world, but you have to roll your sleeves up and when the game gets a bit tight you say you're going to do your bit for the team,\" he said on Super Sunday. \"This isn't a tricky winger, it's just a little shimmy. He's like yeah, have a cross. This ends up being the winning goal.",
      "\"It's not like someone's done a brilliant trick or run at him with real pace. You get down low, you get your body in position. You say if you're going to get a cross in, you're going to have to do remarkably well.",
      "\"There are too many players who don't do enough. Not just Dalot. In the last two games Man Utd have conceded six goals. What chance have you got? Newcastle are coming up in a few days, they'll come to Old Trafford and enjoy it, they'll have runners.",
      "\"These are the ugly bits of football. We know you've got the other bits, but you've got to do the ugly bits. That's what all the top teams do.",
      "\"But you can also dig deep, you can win playing ugly. You have to find a way to do that.",
      "\"Out of possession they're one of the worst teams in the league. With the ball they're good, but if you want to be a top footballer, it's about what you do out of possession.",
      "\"Man Utd cut corners, take too many risks and I'm glad they get punished. I like to see teams getting punished who take chances and let their team-mates and fans down.\"",

      "Goals were likely, United having scored four in each of their two previous games but struggled defensively. And yet, the goalkeepers starred until late in the first half, Senne Lammens keeping out John McGinn, Emi Martinez saving well from Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Rogers' second, another curled effort beyond Lammens, restored Villa's lead and this time Cunha could not find the response. The Brazilian forward should have done so. His unmarked header from Dorgu's left-wing cross missed the target from six yards out.",

      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 15:18, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",
