      "Ruben Amorim has urged Kobbie Mainoo to remain at Manchester United and \"fight for his job\", pointing to Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as examples of players who endured periods on the bench before cementing their Old Trafford legacies.",
      "The academy product is yet to start a Premier League match this season and could depart on loan in January, with Napoli leading a queue of clubs interested in securing his services. However, Amorim wants the youngster to stay and prove himself rather than seek opportunities elsewhere.",
      "The manager has criticised club legends who've suggested Mainoo should leave and has now delivered a direct message to the 20-year-old, who is frustrated by his limited opportunities and has become something of a rallying point for supporters who are eager to see home-grown talent given more chances.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" Amorim explained. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing.",
      "\"I remember all the history of Manchester United and nobody. So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team win. To help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",
      "Amorim made it clear he wasn't trying to make an example of Mainoo by benching him, insisting big names must earn their place at Old Trafford.",
      "Instead, he wants the midfielder to prove him wrong when given the opportunity. Mainoo could be in line for his first league start of the campaign at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim hinting at a tactical shift to a back four that might accommodate him as one of three central midfielders.",
      "Should he get the nod, Amorim encouraged the youngster to channel any frustration into his performance. \"I'm not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let's put him on the bench to show something',\" he explained.",
      "\"No, no. What I'm saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, he's going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me from the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "Just a week earlier, Amorim had suggested Mainoo could seek a January loan if he wished. That conversation never materialised, but Mainoo's situation took an intriguing twist on Monday when his half-brother Jordan turned up to the Bournemouth match sporting a T-shirt emblazoned with 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "\"He's a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid are all scouting AZ Alkmaar star Kees Smit, according to Marca.",
      "All had scouts in attendance at the 19-year-old midfielder's recent games. Smit has made 26 appearances across all competitions this term and is intriguing suitors ahead of the summer.",
      "Manchester City and Chelsea are following the progress of Bayern Munich midfielder Aleksandar Pavlovic, according to TEAMtalk. It is said that the 21-year-old could be 'the nearest thing to Rodri'. With that said, there's no immediate suggestion that either Pavlovic or Bayern want to go their separate ways.",

      "But they could face competition from Barcelona who are eyeing the star and Manchester City and Croatia defender Josko Gvardiol, according to Mundo Deportivo.",
      "AC Milan are considering a loan move for Gabriel Jesus, according to Gianluigi Longari. The forward is just returning from injury and Mikel Arteta has spoken highly of the impact he could have. Could a loan be best in the long term however, with Gyokeres on the scene.",
      "Bayern Munich are ready to offer Manchester United in the region of £43m for Bruno Fernandes, per Fichajes. The 31-year-old recently discussed his disappointment over talk of a summer exit to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Antoine Semenyo favours a move to Liverpool over Manchester City and Manchester United, should he depart Bournemouth in January, according to the Guardian.",
      "An interesting choice from the Cherries star.",
      "Andrea Berta and Arsenal have made contact with Lille midfielder Ayyoub Bouaddi's representatives over a 45m euros (£39.4m) move. They could even hope to get a deal done in January to step ahead of Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool for the 18-year-old Frenchman.",

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery insists he is committed to the plan of getting the best out of loanee Jadon Sancho before the season's end. The United winger is currently plying his trade with the Villans and is therefore unavailable this weekend so as to avoid playing against his parent club.",
      "Rumours have been building as the January transfer window nears with talk that Villa may end Sancho's deal early to make room in the squad for a permanent addition. However, Emery is relishing the thought of getting the peak of the England international's career while he is still at the club.",
      "He said: \"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\"",
      "Former Roma striker Daniel Fonseca has told struggling United star Joshua Zirkzee that he is the 'ideal' addition for the Serie A club. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Uruguayan believes Roma should go for the attacker in January to boost their challenge for the title.",
      "Fonseca said: \"Gasperini deserves a big attacking signing in January. I keep hearing about Manchester United’s Zirkzee; he’d be perfect. With three points in Turin and a nice Christmas present, Roma could fight for the title right until the end.\"",
      "The 24-year-old has made 10 appearances so far for United this season and scored just one goal against Crystal Palace. In recent weeks, the Dutch star has made more of an impact but managed just seven minutes in total against Wolves and Bournemouth.",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs believes Ruben Amorim might discover a positive aspect in losing three crucial players to the Africa Cup of Nations. The Portuguese manager will be deprived of Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo until January as the trio depart to pursue international glory.",
      "United are amongst the Premier League's most heavily African-represented teams. They share third place with several other clubs for the highest number of African players and also sit fourth for the percentage of minutes played by African internationals.",
      "No boss wants to be without players at any point during the campaign, but the problem can become particularly acute during the packed festive schedule, when teams like United face three matches within nine days.",
      "Yet absences can also present chances, enabling other squad members to step forward and prove their worth. Giggs reckons that, despite the upheaval, Amorim might gain from the circumstances.",
      "\"Sesko is now back, which helps. But it's definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it's going to be tough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"But with Sesko coming back, Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don't know how we're going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "\"I'm not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don't go through the group stage, and we don't miss them for too long.",
      "\"The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that's a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they're playing regularly.",
      "\"And now we're starting to see the Mason Mount that we've seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He's a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you're a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to find his feet in the Premier League. The striker has netted just twice in the competition, with a knee problem that ruled him out for nearly a month disrupting his progress.",
      "Now back to full fitness, he'll be determined to prove his worth.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is also working his way back to peak condition following a cruciate ligament injury that sidelined him for nearly 300 days. The Argentine defender has faced numerous injury setbacks since arriving at Old Trafford and will be desperate to put those troubles behind him.",
      "Mason Mount, similar to Martinez, has had his fair share of injury woes since joining United. Now back in form, the England international is showing promising signs as a regular starter under Amorim.",
      "United are set to return to the pitch on Sunday, heading to the Midlands to take on high-flying Aston Villa. A win could potentially propel Amorim's team into the top four, depending on other match outcomes.",

      "The trio have linked up with the Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Morocco squads, respectively, ahead of the African Cup of Nations. And while the United boss is aware of the impact their absences could have, he has called on the rest of the squad to step up during the tournament.",
      "\"We need to play a little bit different,\" Amorim said to MUTV ahead of Sunday’s trip to Villa Park. \"We lost some one-against-one. We will see but we'll be ready for the game.",
      "\"It's perfect, it's not perfect as we don't have all the players, but we are ready. We have players that can solve the game for us, so are happy with that.",
      "\"Yes [we have lost Amad and Mbeumo] and also Nous,\" Ruben continued. \"So Nous is also really important for us but, when one player is out, we have opportunities for other players.",
      "\"Last year, in some games, we managed to win, especially in Europe, without Amad. Bryan was not here, so we already have those moments of difficulty. So we are ready, more than ready, to cope with that.\"",
      "And while United will be without Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui for the foreseeable future, one man who will provide Amorim with a considerable boost is Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian is now back in contention having missed four matches with a knee injury, while he made a substitute appearance last time against Bournemouth.",
      "\"I think he is a different type of striker,\" Amorim said about the forward. \"The only one in that part because Josh [Zirkzee] is more like a no.9 and 10 at the same time, a little bit like Cunha. Ben is a guy who likes to be in the box. He makes a lot of runs.",
      "\"Of course, if you look at him, you can feel that he has so much more to give. He is improving the physicality, he was one month without playing, but he is ready and he is going to help us.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to take on an in-form Aston Villa side in the Premier League on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils had to settle for a 4-4 draw in a dramatic encounter with Bournemouth at Old Trafford last time out.",
      "Having come under enormous pressure earlier this season due to poor results, Amorim has found some stability with his team now on 26 points and vying for one of the Champions League spots. The trip to Villa Park is expected to be a challenging affair as the Villans are in the midst of a nine game winning streak in all competitions.",
      "Amorim’s task will be made even more difficult by several of his key players departing for the Africa Cup of Nations. But times of difficulty can bring positive change, which Amorim will hope can be the case.",
      "The rollercoaster draw against Bournemouth saw Amorim deploy a very different version of the 3-4-2-1 system he has rarely strayed from during his year-long tenure. Amad on the right flank played further ahead of the left wing-back, Diogo Dalot, whose position was more akin to a traditional left-back.",
      "Leny Yoro therefore played the right-back role as Amad tucked inside as a midfielder and occasionally moved back to right wing-back. Amorim admitted post-game he had been working on a different shape at Carrington.",
      "That means his formation against Aston Villa on Sunday could once again resemble more of a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2. The Portuguese admitted last week United would have to change once Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui left for the Africa Cup of Nations, which gets underway this weekend.",
      "Given those departures and Casemiro’s suspension, United could line-up with the following starting XI against Unai Emery’s men: Lammens; Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Fernandes, Mainoo; Mount, Sesko, Cunha.",
      "Reports suggest Bournemouth sensation Antoine Semenyo is United’s top transfer target ahead of the January window. The Red Devils could be set for a four-way tussle with Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City for the winger, whose £65million release clause activates at the start of next month.",
      "Semenyo, 25, was linked with an Old Trafford move last summer but Bournemouth’s £80m asking price led United to cool their interest. But Amorim has remained a huge admirer, even describing Semenyo as a “special player” ahead of the draw against the Cherries.",
      "If United successfully land the Ghanaian in January, he could be used as a left-winger in a 4-3-3 or provide a solution to their left wing-back problem in a 3-4-2-1, given Dalot has failed to convince in the role.",
      "Crucially, Ghana have failed to qualify for AFCON, which means Semenyo remains eligible for selection for his new club throughout January if signed.",
      "United could also be active in the transfer market by way of outgoings as they look to fund their pursuit of top talent. In order to pull off fresh signings, reports claim they will listen to offers for their underperforming players, namely Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Malacia was part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ of players who trained away from the first team in the summer but didn’t seal a move away. He has appeared on the bench on several occasions but hasn’t been able to get on the pitch, meaning he could depart in January.",
      "Zirkzee has largely failed to adapt to English football since his £36.5m move from Bologna in 2024. Ugarte has been similarly disappointing since his own £42m move from PSG in the same window, which could see both players transfer listed.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, 20, may also look to leave his boyhood club after failing to break into Amorim’s starting XI. His request for a loan move in the summer was turned down but his growing frustration with a lack of minutes has been a running theme this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Giggs told BetSelect: “Every player wants to play in the World Cup and be on the pitch for their club. But if he goes on loan somewhere, he’s only got three or four months to really hit the ground running. What club has he gone to?",
      "“Is it a club that’s getting beaten every week, and it’s not doing him any favours? Or is it somewhere he’s going to be in and out of the team?”",
      "“He needs to make sure that when he gets his chance, he does well, especially around this time when the games come thick and fast,\" Giggs added. “I thought he did well the other night when he came on against Bournemouth. He just needs to take his chance, and anything can happen.",
      "“If he suddenly takes these opportunities and he’s playing regularly until the end of the season for Man United, that will give him more chance [at the England Squad] than going anywhere else.”",

      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United.

      "Sancho has, however, featured from the off in Villa's last four Europa League matches, though he is still awaiting his first assist for the club.",
      "Sancho has demonstrated glimpses of his talent when coming off the bench, particularly against Arsenal a fortnight ago, when he kept possession alive in the build-up to Emi Buendía's late winner.",
      "With the January transfer window looming, there has been talk that Villa might look to create room in their squad by terminating Sancho's loan early. However, Emery made his position on the winger crystal clear during his pre-United press conference.",
      "\"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance,\" the Villa boss said. \"I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us.",
      "\"Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\"",
      "Villa are heading into their showdown with United on a winning streak, having triumphed in 15 of their last 17 matches, including nine straight victories, six of which were in the league - setting a new club record.",
      "However, United have historically held the upper hand against Villa, securing 41 Premier League victories against them, 18 of those away from home. Only the Red Devils themselves have defeated a single opponent more frequently, both overall and away, with 42 total wins and 19 away victories against Everton.",
      "When questioned if he had discussed Villa's poor track record against United with his team, Emery responded: \"I like usually to share with the players the numbers we have. Our own numbers and also Aston Villa's numbers, also with the trophies they got in the past.",
      "\"The players can analyse better, sometimes - not the moment we are in now - but how is the history for the team. Those numbers really mean a lot. We are facing on Sunday Manchester United ... and it is Manchester United!\".",
      "\"We must be motivated how we are now and how we are setting our objectives. We are third, but the reality is that we were at the bottom at the beginning.",
      "\"We are competing to be consistent in Europe and at the end of the season to try to get into a European position and also get trophies in different competitions.",
      "\"To be consistent and in the demands we are now, setting these demands every day higher, this is the way and the motivation we have.",
      "\"How we can achieve three points on Sunday? This is our motivation. Of course, we connect with our supporters at Villa Park fantastically, and the connection is the best quality we can have.",
      "\"There are lot things, individually and collectively, that give us confidence and motivation to help us get it again.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have climbed up to sixth in the top-flight table after a dismal beginning to the season, but they face a tall order when they travel to Villa Park. Unai Emery's squad have won their last nine games in all competitions.",
      "McTominay has thrived since leaving Old Trafford in 2024 for Napoli, having won a league title and been named Serie A's Most Valuable Player last year for his contributions.",
      "On Thursday evening, his side faced AC Milan in a crunch Supercoppa Italiana semi-final and they emerged as 2-0 victors thanks to goals from David Neres and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But in the 81st minute, with Napoli 2-0 to the good a fight broke out. McTominay committed a foul in midfield and the referee blew the whistle. But as he did, the ball rolled towards ex-Chelsea star Fikayo Tomori.",
      "Tomori, with McTominay still running at him, booted the ball at the Scottish international. McTominay did not take kindly to this and squared up to Tomori, with team-mates flooding in to break the pair up.",
      "Words were exchanged and McTominay was furious. Both players received yellow cards for the altercation which mainly consisted of pushing and shouting and the game ended 2-0.",
      "If transfer rumours are to be believed then McTominay could soon be joined in Naples by young Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old has failed to break into Amorim's first-team plans and even made a loan request over the summer.",

      "Barcelona are increasingly likely to sign Marcus Rashford permanently, with a decision on Hansi Flick's future boosting his chances. Rashford, 28, sealed a dream move to Barca by joining them on a season-long loan in July.",
      "The deal includes an option for Barcelona to purchase the England international for just £26million, despite having two-and-a-half years left on his contract at United. Rashford has contributed to 15 goals in his first 23 matches for Flick's side, helping them open up a four-point gap over Real Madrid in La Liga.",
      "His goal to wrap up Wednesday's hard-fought 2-0 win away to third-tier side Guadalajara was another important contribution. As things stand, Barcelona are more likely to trigger their clause than not.",
      "That's according to Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo - but there's a catch. Camp Nou chiefs want to see how Rashford fares competing with the fit-again Raphinha during the second half of this season.",
      "Rashford has predominately played on the left of Barcelona's attack since joining. That's the position in which vice-captain Raphinha shone last season, racking up an incredible 34 goals and 22 assists goals in 57 games, and helping Barca win a domestic treble.",
      "However, Raphinha has been used as a No.10 by Flick on occasion this season and with veteran striker Robert Lewandowski's contract expiring in June, Rashford will be looking to nail down one of the positions. What's more is that reports from Germany claim that Barcelona want to extend Flick's contract beyond 2027.",
      "The ex-Bayern Munich boss is a big fan of Rashford, so signing a new deal would only increase the likelihood of a permanent stay for the loanee. It's not to just on the pitch where Flick admirers Rashford either.",
      "After leaving Rashford on the bench for a recent game, Flick recalled: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected, and the last time I checked with him he replied me, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has shed light on his former team-mate Marcus Rashford, discussing how their playing styles worked well together.",
      "Rashford, a product of United's academy set-up, made his first-team debut in 2016 at the age of 18. He went on to rack up over 420 appearances for the Red Devils across all competitions, netting 138 goals and providing 78 assists.",
      "However, following the appointment of Ruben Amorim last November, Rashford found his game time reduced and spent the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "This season, he's plying his trade in La Liga with Barcelona, where he's scored seven times in 23 appearances to date during his loan spell.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, joined United from Sporting CP in January 2020 and quickly became a key figure. In nearly six years at Old Trafford, he's clocked up over 300 appearances and was handed the captain's armband in July 2023.",
      "Since 2020, Rashford and Fernandes have shared the pitch on more than 200 occasions, contributing to 26 goals between them.",
      "While Fernandes has played alongside some top-tier forwards over the years, including recent summer signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, his on-field partnership with Rashford remains one of the most effective.",
      "Speaking on Rio Meets on the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the 31-year-old reflected on the bonds he's forged with team-mates, both current and former, including Rashford, Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial.",
      "\"With Rashy,\" Fernandes said. \"It was more about the type of player I am and the type of player he is.",
      "\"So the type of service he needs was kind of a match between us two. Rashy’s runs in behind were unbelievable and powerful.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if the two will ever be reunited at United. The Spanish heavyweights have an option in Rashford's loan that allows them to land the forward on a permanent basis next summer for £26m.",
      "But if Barcelona look to strike an agreement worth less than that set figure, United will have to decide whether to pull out of a deal and potentially bring Rashford back to Manchester.",
      "This Sunday sees Fernandes and United take on a challenging away fixture in the Premier League against surprise title-chasers Aston Villa. Then, on Boxing Day, United welcome Newcastle to Old Trafford as they look to improve their league position before the New Year arrives.",
      "Meanwhile, Rashford and Barcelona face Villarreal away on Sunday, hoping to extend their advantage at the summit of La Liga. Following that, they'll enjoy a brief winter hiatus before resuming action in early January with another away encounter, this time against Espanyol.",

      "Fortunately for both London clubs, the tournament will not impact their squad availability, with no players set to be involved. It is a different story for United, however, who will have to navigate the next month without some big names.",
      "The Red Devils will miss Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are representing Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively. All three of those nations, particularly Morocco, are likely to reach the latter stages of the competition.",

      "Participating nations can name up to two reserve players who can be called upon before the tournament kicks off in light of any last-minute injury concerns.",
      "Guessand joined Villa from French side Nice back in the summer for a fee in the region of £30million.",
      "The right winger has scored two goals in his 18 appearances across all competitions so far. Both came in Europa League matches, the first against Go Ahead Eagles and the second during their recent trip to face Basel.",
      "Despite Guessand's struggles in front of goal in the Premier League, Unai Emery's side are still enjoying a strong run of form. They have won their last nine games in all competitions, with their most recent defeat coming against Liverpool at Anfield at the start of November.",

      "Having left hometown club Royal Antwerp to sign for United aged 16, the midfielder became close friends with Adnan Januzaj, and played alongside Jesse Lingard, Michael Keane and Andreas Pereira. In 2014, Ekangamene joined Carlisle United on loan and made his professional debut in their League One clash with Bristol City.",
      "The Belgian decided to leave Old Trafford later that year and returned to his homeland, joining Zulte Waregem on a four-year deal. Ekangamene went on to play for clubs in the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain and Gibraltar.",

      "Knockout stage qualification will only increase Mbeumo's absence, which again could extend seven matches in total.",

      "His country have scheduled group stage matches against Comoros (Dec 21), Mali (Dec 26), and Zambia (Dec 29). Were a major shock to take place and the hosts be eliminated this early on, the full-back would miss only three United matches and be eligible to return against Leeds.",

      "Brighton captain Lewis Dunk leads the way with a whopping 1123. He is followed by Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk (1052), Manchester City's Ruben Dias (976), Seagulls teammate Jan Paul van Hecke (963) and Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah (957).",
      "The high defensive line is clearly a favourite tactic across the board.",
      "Manchester United are on a quest to get back amongst Europe's elite. At the moment they sit sixth in the table, two points shy of fourth-placed Chelsea, but they might have already been ahead of their rivals if not for the woodwork.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team have hit the post or crossbar a combined 10 times in the league so far in 2025/26 - more than any of their rivals. Bruno Fernandes has been responsible for four of those - unlucky...",
      "Since his British-record £125m transfer from Newcastle United to Liverpool, Alexander Isak has struggled to match his previously goalscoring form.",
      "To start, he is barely having an impact on play for the Reds, averaging only 14 touches per game - and an even lesser two touches in the opposition penalty area - per appearance so far this term...",
      "Another trend now, as Premier League data in 2025/26 has shown a 162 per cent increase in long throws taken per match compared to last season. The average per game has climbed from 1.5 up to 3.8.",
      "Brentford's Michael Kayode has truly established himself as the modern Rory Delap, with a total of 54 throws launched into opposition penalty areas so far this season.",
      "No Premier League player has been caught offside more times this season than Bournemouth striker Evanilson.",
      "The Brazilian has been penalised 13 times - three more than any other player in the division. What's more, it has cost him four goals ruled out for offside so far...",
      "Coming back to Wolves' woes, perhaps nobody can feel more aggrieved by this than Hugo Bueno.",
      "The 23-year-old full-back has actually been one of the Premier League's biggest attacking inspirations. With 21 successful crosses in open play, no other player has managed more than that so far this season.",
      "He'll be frustrated his teammates aren't converting his lay-ups into goals, with Wolves on the scoresheet a measly six times this campaign - only two of those actually coming from crosses...",
      "Tottenham Hotspur brought Joao Palhinha back to the Premier League on loan over the summer. The midfielder had completed two seasons at Bayern Munich after leaving Fulham.",
      "The Portuguese international has settled back in quickly, recording the most tackles so far in 2025/26 with 65. His nearest challenger, Nottingham Forest's Neco Williams, has 52."

      "Ruben Amorim has insisted that Manchester United won't need 10 or 11 years to challenge for the Premier League title, like Sir Alex Ferguson has predicted. United have not won the Premier League since Ferguson claimed his 13th league title in 2013 and have been struggling for consistency ever since their legendary boss retired.",
      "Their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday showed improvements in attack following the £200million spend on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but also their leaky defence.",
      "Ferguson remains a regular at Old Trafford and has been keeping a close eye on their development under Amorim, who has now been in charge for over a year and has won 23 of his 59 matches.",
      "\"He (Amorim) is a good personality. It is not easy,” Ferguson told Press Box PR. “I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be 10 years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",
      "United face Aston Villa in the league on Sunday and Amorim was asked about Ferguson's prediction in his pre-match press conference. “He understands football more than me, especially English football,” Amorim said. “I think we are not (going to) take that long to win a league.",
      "“I don’t know which manager is going to be here, but I truly believe that we can fight for the title in the next years. I think it’s not going to take so many years, but you never know.”",
      "Amorim also responded to Kobbie Mainoo's half-brother wearing a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford on Monday in a post that went viral on social media. “No, it was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt,\" Amorim said when asked if he'd spoken to the midfielder about it.",
      "“He is not going to start because of the t-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "“I am used to (it). I am here for a year. It’s not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.”",

The England international is yet to be handed a single Premier League start this season and has been limited to 11 substitute appearances under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "During Monday night's thrilling 4-4 draw vs Bournemouth at Old Trafford, Mainoo once again entered the game from the bench, receiving a rousing ovation from the home supporters. The 20-year-old has been the subject of intense transfer speculation in recent months, with the January window looming on the horizon.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are among the clubs reportedly circling for Mainoo's signature. United are, though, said to have no intention of allowing their academy graduate to depart just yet.",
      "However, Shearer believes a parting of ways could benefit all concerned parties.",
      "\"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo,\" Shearer said in an interview with Betfair. \"Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue.",
      "\"And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants. And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them - and that looks as if it's going to be the case for him.",
      "\"I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like. But I guess, looking in from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards.",
      "\"Whether that's on a loan or whether that's a permanent deal, then we'll have to wait and see. But clearly, if you're not playing, you have to look at the situation and get out.\"",
      "When quizzed about Mainoo's limited playing time this season, Amorim has been candid about team choices.",
      "\"I see him [Mainoo] as a starter like the other players,\" Amorim said last month. \"I have to make a choice and then - in the end - it's not been Kobbie.",
      "\"In the future, I don't know. Again, I always think the same thing with Casemiro. [He] was not playing and then he plays. I just want to win games. I don't care who's playing.\"",
      "United legend Paul Scholes echoed Shearer's sentiments, suggesting that Mainoo might be better served seeking opportunities elsewhere. \"The kid [Mainoo] is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football,\" Scholes posted on Instagram in response to Amorim's recent remarks about Mainoo.",
      "\"Hate seeing home grown players leave. But it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",

      "These observations didn't sit well with the players, who both uploaded images of their achievements to their Instagram profiles on Monday when the quotes emerged. Amass shared a photograph of himself holding a player of the month trophy at Sheffield Wednesday, whilst Chido's post showed him celebrating a goal for the Under-21s.",
      "Amorim maintained his remarks weren't meant negatively and argued that the reaction from the pair of 18 year olds exemplified the sense of privilege he believes persists at the club. \"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",
      "\"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping. That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement.",

      "\"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has been impressed by three of Manchester United’s summer signings and has backed them to inspire better form at Old Trafford. United shelled out over £200million on new players in the summer and the new additions have begun to gel in recent weeks under Ruben Amorim’s management.",
      "United brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens before the start of the 2025/26 season, while January signing Diego Leon also arrived following their 15th-place finish. Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp and was installed as the No.1 goalkeeper, with Andre Onana shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "Some pundits were worried that Lammens may struggle with the jump up in quality, having only played in Belgium’s top flight, but he has settled well between the posts. Ferguson, who managed United between 1987 and 2013, is still a regular at Old Trafford to watch Amorim’s side and is a fan of Lammens.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper has made a difference,” Ferguson told Press Box PR. “He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",
      "\"The other two, Mbeumo and Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.” United are sixth in the Premier League following their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday at Old Trafford.",
      "That high-scoring draw means United are now joint second-top scorers in the Premier League, level with leaders Arsenal on 30 goals, with Manchester City (38) the only club to have scored more. But their 26 goals conceded shows that issues remain in defence, with that the highest of any side in the top 12 of the table.",
      "Ferguson won 13 league titles for United and is confident that the club have the right person in place with Amorim, even if it will take a long time to get them back to the top. “He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy,” he said.",

Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, which is only active for part of January, to give the Cherries enough time to replace their main man.",
      "In addition to United, Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham are also interested in signing the 25-year-old. Amorim labelled Semenyo a \"special player\" before United's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday and saw first hand how dangerous he can be, with the Ghana international netting his seventh goal of the season.",
      "He is a versatile forward and could be used at wing-back if United land their man, although they will face fierce competition to do so next month. United have recently lost three players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but Amorim confirmed that there will be short-term moves next month and hinted that any deal could be in a position that isn't necessarily the top priority.",

      "\"The only thing that we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think is going to be the future,\" said Amorim. \"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has flirted with the idea of playing a back four over the next few weeks out of necessity. The club's best wing-back, Amad, is away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) along with United's talisman Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire - two players so comfortable in the centre of a back three - are both injured providing a selection headache for Amorim. Those who are available look more suited to a 4-3-3 system and MEN Sport expects the Reds to revert to that today.",
      "Diogo Dalot will undoubtedly benefit from playing as a right-back again. The Portuguese defender tries valiantly to fit as a wing-back on both flanks but his strongest position is in a flat back four which should be used at Villa Park. Amorim will also be tempted to recall Lisandro Martinez to the team in the West Midlands considering the Argentine's experience.",
      "Ayden Heaven is certainly a star for the future and while this season has not reached the same heights as last year, it is way too early to write him off. That being said, Martinez will play alongside Leny Yoro if he is fit enough to play a full 90 minutes for the club.",
      "Another star almost guaranteed to feature in the clash with Villa is Manuel Ugarte. This is a half chance for the Uruguayan with Casemiro suspended but it would take a sensational performance for him to replace the Brazilian vs Newcastle.",
      "Alongside him in a three should be Kobbie Mainoo. Amorim spoke glowingly about the midfielder in his pre-match press conference despite his brother's t-shirt antics on Monday night. Mainoo will not be punished for what his brother did and rightly so. A start against Villa would be a show of confidence in the academy graduate over a pivotal festive period.",
      "Benjamin Sesko also returned to the pitch on Monday night following his knee injury suffered in the draw at Tottenham. The striker looked more confident coming off the bench against Bournemouth and now is a big opportunity for him.",
      "With Mbeumo out, Amorim will be looking to his striker to fill in with goals for the club. Of course, it will not all be on Sesko's shoulders and Matheus Cunha will be hopeful of building on his second strike for the Reds earlier this week.",

      "As Ruben Amorim laid waste to his Manchester United players, barely anyone was spared. Amorim railed against a sense of entitlement within the club, bemoaned the failure of anyone to knock on his door to air their frustrations and complained about the leadership group failing to take some issues off his hands.",
      "This was the day Amorim upped the ante with his squad. Perhaps Bruno Fernandes was one who emerged unscathed, described as a \"special character\" and an \"example\". How Amorim must wish he could clone his countryman.",
      "This felt like a calculated attack by Amorim. After 13 months in charge, he is still unhappy with what he is seeing, not necessarily on the pitch, but off it, and he is taking it upon himself to be the man who turns that around.",
      "\"Sometimes I am the first to say that I am failing this club inside the pitch, I have that feeling we are not performing the way we should,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Outside the pitch, I guarantee you I am not failing this club. I think it is something in our club. The players sometimes forget what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that is the feeling I have.\"",
      "This is the culture Amorim is railing against. His most brutal attack came when he was asked about the quickly deleted social media posts by Harry Amass and Chido Obi on Monday, as they took exception to their head coach's comments about their own struggles.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments shouldn't be seen as negative and twice used the word \"entitlement\" as he made a broader point about attitudes inside the club.",
      "\"I think it is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids. We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "A week ago, Amorim had told Kobbie Mainoo that his office door was always open and that if he wanted to leave in January, he should come and tell him. He told Amass and Chido that if they had an issue, they knew where to find him.",
      "Twice, Amorim repeated the idea that he was always available to his players, and his assertion that nobody was coming to see him felt like another dig; too many were happy to complain on social media or to friends and family, rather than going to their manager.",
      "There was also criticism of his six-man leadership group, which consists of Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martínez, and Tom Heaton.",
      "In the summer, Amorim said he wanted that group to deal with more dressing room issues and that they couldn't let everything fall on his shoulders. Five months later, nothing has changed.",
      "\"It continues a bit everything on my desk, every problem it is still me, but again my door is still open,\" he said.",
      "Amorim has always been an open and engaging communicator in press conferences. He talks freely and sometimes has a message to get across and isn't afraid to throw a few punches in the process.",
      "This week, most of those messages were aimed at his own squad. It's time to see how they respond, and whether the 40-year-old can be the man to end the entitlement he feels is holding Manchester United back.",

      "Manchester United will be without several key players this weekend as they face Aston Villa away from home. A win could take Ruben Amorim's side level on points with fourth and fifth placed Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "If United can avoid defeat, they could go five games undefeated for the second time this season in the Premier League. Amorim will hope his players still have their shooting-boots on after scoring eight goals in their last two games - a 4-1 win over Wolves followed by a dramatic 4-4 draw against Bournemouth.",
      "However, the United boss will not be happy with the amount of star players he won't be able to select for today's squad. The absence reasons range from injuries, international duty and game suspensions.",
      "The Brazilian international will be unavailable for selection against Aston Villa after receiving his fifth individual yellow card this season in United's clash with Bournemouth.",
      "This means Casemiro will serve a one-match suspension. He has been one of Amorim's go-to men this campaign after facing questions regarding his future at the club over the summer.",
      "Harry Maguire is still recovering from an injury he sustained in Man United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham earlier this season.",
      "The English defender has suffered a supposed thigh injury which could see him sidelined until late December. The former Red's skipper has been rotated in and out of the squad since the start of the season.",
      "The 26-year-old centre-back will not be available against Villa as he remains out of the squad due to a back injury he endured in late November.",
      "Amorim had stated earlier this month that he was being \"careful\" with De Ligt in not returning him to the pitch too quickly. Before his back problem, the Dutchman had started all 13 available games in the league.",
      "Ruben Amorim will also be without three further players due to their participation in the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Jadon Sancho will be unable to play against Manchester United due to being on loan from the club.",
      "The 25-year-old has largely been used as a rotation player in the Premier League, but he has been impressing for Unai Emery in the Europa League.",
      "The Aston Villa goalkeeper could be out of action for today's clash due to a back injury.",
      "Unai Emery said earlier this week that they would decide late on if he is available or not. It was only a few months ago in which Martinez was close to joining United in the summer transfer window.",
      "Harvey Elliott, a player very much in need of more playing time, could be out of action this weekend due to illness.",
      "Like Martinez, the club will make a late call on whether the Liverpool-loanee can play. Emery had hinted that Elliott should be available for the match today.",
      "Unai Emery has a further list of players that he won't be able to select for his match-day squad against Man United."

      "Ryan Giggs has urged Kobbie Mainoo to stay at Manchester United, despite Alan Shearer and Nicky Butt suggesting the youngster should look elsewhere for regular game time. Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League match this season and has made 11 substitute appearances under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Monday's 4-4 home draw with Bournemouth saw Mainoo come off the bench to a warm reception from the Old Trafford crowd. His lack of regular minutes has fuelled growing speculation about his future, with the January transfer window set to open next month.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are among the clubs credited with an interest in signing Mainoo in recent weeks, although reports suggest United have no intention of letting the midfielder leave Old Trafford in January despite the speculation.",
      "Giggs, meanwhile, believes the 20‑year‑old should remain patient and take his chances when he's given them. \"I can see where the lads [Scholes and Butt] are coming from,\" the Reds' icon told betting comparison site BetSelect.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United. It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult. We all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "Giggs continued: \"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I'd like to see him stay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Shearer has previously explained why it might be in Mainoo's best interest to leave United and why a move could also benefit the Reds. \"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo,\" the Newcastle United icon said.",
      "\"Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue. And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants.",
      "\"And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them. And that looks as if it's going to be the case for him. I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like.",
      "\"But I guess looking from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards. Whether that's on loan or whether that's a permanent deal, then we'll have to wait and see.",
      "\"But clearly, if you're not playing, you have to look at the situation and get out.\"",
      "Butt, who shares the same view, said: \"For his football career, he has to leave Manchester United. He's lost 18 months of development.",
      "\"I hope he goes abroad because it is embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea which they might go and get him, they are putting together a very young squad.\"",

      "As Manchester United sought to add a goalkeeper to their squad in the closing days and hours of the summer transfer window, they had two No.1s waiting by the phone ready to receive the call. United's transfer executives were weighing up moves for Senne Lammens and Emiliano Martinez, two goalkeepers at very different stages of their careers.",
      "Lammens, 23, had never played outside of Belgium and had fewer than 100 games under his belt at this stage, of which only 68 had been in the top division. Martinez was a World Cup winner, a two-time winner of the Yashin Trophy for the world's best goalkeeper and had 250 Premier League games under his belt. He might have been about to turn 33, but he still had plenty to offer.",
      "In the end, United's transfer pivot towards youth and data won the battle. Lammens arrived as United's most inexperienced first-choice goalkeeper for a long time. He has had a solid start to his Old Trafford career, if not spectacular, and didn't have a great game against Bournemouth on Monday.",
      "But there is clear potential there. Lammens is a calm goalkeeper who always looks unflustered. His kicking has been secure and he has spread confidence through the defence thanks to his serenity, something that had been lacking in recent seasons.",
      "Martinez had set his heart on a move to United. He had tears in his eyes as he waved to the Villa fans at the end of last season in a move that seemed to signal he would be on his way in the summer. Even on deadline day, a switch to Old Trafford looked a possibility.",
      "For whatever reason, it never materialised. Marco Bizot began the season in goal for Villa, but when Martinez stayed, Unai Emery brought him back in, and he has once again been outstanding at Villa Park, a key figure in what is an unlikely push to enter the title race throughout the first half of the season.",
      "Villa will certainly be the favourites on Sunday. They have won nine in a row in all competitions and 15 of their last 17 games, a remarkable run of form that has propelled them into contention after a disappointing start. You would expect Lammens to be the busier goalkeeper.",
      "That's if Martinez even makes it. He has missed the last two games due to a back injury, and given the possibility of him having another strong performance to deny the club that considered signing him just four months ago, it might be easier for Ruben Amorim if he is unavailable.",
      "It's far too early to judge the success or otherwise of Lammens, who is clearly a goalkeeper still learning his trade. If United had made their decision based on the goalkeeper likely to be a better performer this season, then they would have gone for Martinez. However, under Ineos, there has been a shift towards long-term thinking.",
      "When United signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp for £21.7million, director of football Jason Wilcox highlighted his \"potential\" and after making his debut, Amorim admitted to being surprised by the impact the young goalkeeper had made. His rock-solid debut against Sunderland earned him those comparisons with Peter Schmeichel from the Stretford End.",
      "It was never going to be an entirely smooth journey for Lammens, however, and there is maybe just the hint of a question or two being asked now, although he clearly remains United's best option in goal. The alternative was to sign someone else, and that someone else could well be at the opposite end of the pitch this weekend.",

      "Manchester United face one of their toughest challenges in recent weeks this afternoon as they travel to Aston Villa in the Premier League. Unai Emery's side are on an exceptional run of form having won their last nine matches in all competitions and currently they sit seven points clear of the Reds.",
      "Ruben Amorim's task has been made even harder thanks to a handful of absences. In defence, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain out due to injury while Noussair Mazraoui is with the Morocco squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are also with their national teams for AFCON. Meanwhile, Casemiro picked up his fifth yellow card of the season on Monday night in the draw against Bournemouth and is suspended. He will be available for the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle.",
      "So with selection headaches galore for Amorim heading into the busy festive period, picking Sunday's team is by no means a foregone conclusion. Here is who our MEN Sport United writers think should be starting at Villa this weekend.",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Amorim has dropped another hint over a back four this week and it feels inevitable we are heading in that direction. I'd go that way at Villa, with Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the full-backs, which allows Lisandro Martinez to return alongside Leny Yoro in defence.",
      "In midfield, Ugarte has to come in for Casemiro, but three players in there should mean a first Premier League start for Kobbie Mainoo, who has to take the chance to impress. Bruno Fernandes will round off that trio.",
      "Benjamin Sesko should be fit enough to lead the line now, with Matheus Cunha coming in off the left. Right-wing is a bit of a problem, but Mason Mount has the intelligence to play there and his form makes him worthy of a start.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "It is a bit of a risk considering the players available to Amorim this weekend but I would be tempted to stick with a back three at Villa Park. Ayden Heaven has looked shaky against better opposition which is why recalling Martinez to play the slightly unfamiliar role at the centre of the back three makes sense.",
      "Dalot should benefit from playing on his preferred right while it would be a big chance for Patrick Dorgu to show he can offer a good option on the left. Sticking with 3-4-2-1 means there would be no place for Mainoo in the starting XI as Ugarte has to replace Casemiro.",
      "Up front, a three of Mount, Cunha and Sesko is an exciting prospect especially if the latter two's form can step up a notch in the absence of Mbeumo.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Kobbie Mainoo to stay and \"fight for his job\" at Manchester United, telling the academy graduate to follow the example of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, who both had spells on the bench but knuckled down to fight for their Old Trafford futures.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season and could leave on loan next month, with Napoli at the head of a long list of suitors for his signature, but Amorim wants the academy graduate to stay and fight instead. Amorim took aim at the club legends telling Mainoo to leave on Friday and has now directed his message to the 20-year-old, who is frustrated at a lack of playing time at Old Trafford and is becoming a cause celebre among supporters, who are desperate to see one of their own playing more often.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" said Amorim. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing. I remember all the history of Manchester United and nobody. So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team win. To help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",
      "Amorim insisted he wasn't using Mainoo to make a point that big players must earn their stripes at Old Trafford and accept a spell on the bench, but that he must prove the head coach wrong when he gets a chance. Mainoo could earn a first league start of the season at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim confirming he is considering a switch to a back four, which could offer Mainoo a route into the team as one of three midfielders.",
      "If he does get the chance, then Amorim urged the young midfielder to use his anger as fuel to show everyone what he can do. \"I’m not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something',\" he said.",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, he's going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me from the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "A week ago Amorim told Mainoo to come and see him if he wanted a loan move in January. That didn't happen and Mainoo's future took another turn on Monday, when half-brother Jordan wore a t-shirt saying 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' to the game against Bournemouth.",
      "\"He’s a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",

      "The 83-year-old won 13 Premier League titles in his time at Old Trafford but feels it could be a while before they are at the top of the tree again domestically, offering qualified backing to Amorim in the process.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is a good personality,\" he said. \"It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",

I don't know which manager is going to be here, but I truly believe that we can fight for the title in the next years, and I think it's not going to take so many years, but you never know.\"",

      "\"I don't know if it's fair. He just spoke about what is his feelings and he needs to answer to that. It's not me. I think he is an example that he gives everything. He puts everything on the line in every training, in every match. In that department he's special.",
      "\"I think he has that feeling. We need to step up and to have also that feeling. So we need to ask him, because I think he's a big example in the group.",
      "\"He spoke his feelings. And I think, again, I think when I watch Bruno training and playing, he's a special character. And I think the numbers, the amount of games, everything proves that he's a different player.\"",

Amass posted a picture of him with a player of the month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the Under-21s.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments weren't negative and said the response of the pair of 18-year-olds summed up the sense of entitlement that he feels continues to linger around the club. \"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",

      "\"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.",

The image went viral after Jordan posed for pictures at Old Trafford wearing the t-shirt during the 4-4 draw.",
      "Amorim stressed that the incident wouldn't influence his team selection and that he had no bone to pick with Mainoo over it, despite it being another issue that he has been forced to deal with this week. \"It was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt. He's not going to start because of the t-shirt but he's not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He's going to play if we feel that he's the right guy to play,\" said Amorim.",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs believes Ruben Amorim could yet find a silver lining in losing three key players to the Africa Cup of Nations. The Portuguese boss will be without Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo until January as all three head off in search of international success.",
      "United are among the Premier League’s most Africa-represented squads. They are tied with several other clubs for the third-highest number of African players and also rank fourth for the proportion of minutes played by African internationals.",
      "No manager wants to lose players at any stage of the season, but the issue can become even more pronounced during the congested festive period, when sides like United face three games in the space of nine days.",
      "However, absences can also create opportunities, allowing other players to step up and stake their claim. Giggs believes that, despite the disruption, Amorim could benefit from the situation.",
      "\"Sesko is now back, which helps. But it's definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it's going to be tough.",
      "“But with Sesko coming back, Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don't know how we're going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "\"I'm not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don't go through the group stage, and we don't miss them for too long.",
      "\"The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that's a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they're playing regularly.",
      "\"And now we're starting to see the Mason Mount that we've seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He's a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you're a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has endured a difficult start to life in the Premier League. He has managed just two goals in the competition so far, and a knee injury that sidelined him for almost a month stalled his momentum. Now fully fit, he will be eager to make an impact.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is also edging closer to full sharpness after returning from a cruciate ligament injury that kept him out for almost 300 days. The Argentine has suffered a series of setbacks during his time at Old Trafford and will be hoping his fitness issues are now behind him.",
      "Mason Mount, like Martinez, has had to battle through multiple injury problems since arriving at United. Now fit again, the England international has begun to deliver encouraging performances as a regular starter under Amorim.",
      "United are back in action on Sunday as they travel to the Midlands to face high-flying Aston Villa. A victory could lift Amorim’s side into the top four, depending on other results.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

The tournament in Morocco kicks off on Sunday with the host nation taking on Comoros. The final takes place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18.",
      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "Meanwhile, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to fall at the group stages - meaning he could be available for United again away at Leeds on January 4, should that come to pass.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "The Supercomputer also predicts that Senegal will oust Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a resounding 3-0 win. However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction reckons Amad is also likely to return at a similar time to Mazraoui for the Arsenal game in late January.",
      "In what could be the tournament's biggest upset, Egypt and their star player Mohamed Salah are predicted to fall to Comoros with a 1-0 loss in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",

      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",

United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",

      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that “more than ten” clubs are looking to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils looking to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window, which could knock Mainoo even further down the pecking order.",
      "Amorim, much to the annoyance of the Man Utd board, publicly declared that Mainoo would be serving as a back-up option to captain Bruno Fernandes this season.",
      "That saw Mainoo seek a loan move away from Old Trafford before the end of the summer transfer window before being talked into staying by Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "After making no Premier League starts so far this season and 11 substitute appearances, Mainoo is once again looking to leave Man Utd on loan in the winter market.",
      "Mainoo’s brother came to their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth last weekend with a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ t-shirt on but Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim doesn’t hold that against the player himself.",
      "READ: Premier League player stats: Bruno Fernandes the top playmaker as Anderson shines for Forest",
      "Amorim just wants the Man Utd midfielder to kick on, he said: “He’s a shy boy, but it’s not his responsibility. He’s responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, so I’m just focused on that.",
      "“I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something in the internet and I have to answer for that.",
      "“My explanation is, ‘He has his life, he has his opinion, it’s nothing to do with me’, so I will do the same with Kobbie.",
      "“Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that it’s not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.",
      "“I remember (Cristiano) Ronaldo was on the bench, (Wayne) Rooney was on the bench sometimes. (Juan Sebastian) Veron was not playing.",
      "“I remember all the history of Manchester United and (there is) nobody this didn’t fall (to), so let’s continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.",
      "“Believe it or not, I just want to want to help the team to win and help Kobbie to be a better player.”",
      "And now Romano has revealed that there are more than ten clubs looking to sign Mainoo with the England international seeking a way out of Old Trafford on loan before the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Ruben Amorim made clear that the shirt, ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo,’ that the brother of Mainoo, Jordan, was wearing, he didn’t see that, but he also said, I’m not going to sanction or punish Mainoo because of a shirt he was not even wearing, it was someone else from his family.",
      "“It’s not that Kobbie is going to play because of that, or he’s not going to play because of that, so no consequences. What I can tell you is that Mainoo, in his mind, still has this desire to play more, still has this intention to go on loan, still has this plan to go play, develop, grow and then return to Man Utd.",
      "“It’s an opportunity for Man Utd to have a better player in the near future. It’s an opportunity for the player to have a chance to go to the World Cup 2026 with England. So far, he has started zero games in the Premier League, and Kobbie doesn’t want to be in this situation also for the second half of the season.",
      "“We will see how the conversations will go because this story is up to Man Utd. From Napoli, they are really hoping for a solution. Napoli want Mainoo. It’s more than 10 clubs, but Napoli, after [Scott] McTominay, after Rasmus Hojlund – they are both doing very good there – hope that they can have the opportunity to get also Mainoo from Man Utd.",
      "“But this will be up to Man Utd and Amorim. So, Mainooo is waiting. Napoli are waiting. They are waiting to see what Man Utd will do. At the moment, still no sort of green light.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Bruno Fernandes’ release clause at Man Utd stands at “slightly over €60m”.",
      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has urged Kobbie Mainoo to “have patience” given his current role at the club, but admits many feel he should be playing more often.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is open to a permanent move away from Old Trafford as he doesn’t see a future at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed why he is not confident about Manchester United’s chances of winning the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave permanently in January if they receive an ‘exceptional’ offer.",
      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports."

      "However, Fernandes revealed earlier this week that he was “hurt” by the feeling that the Man Utd hierarchy would have gladly sold him for the right money in the summer.",
      "In the interview, the Man Utd midfielder said: “Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be. I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",

      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”",
      "That has raised the possibility of a move in January for Fernandes and Romano has revealed that he has a release clause in his contract at Man Utd for €60m for non-Premier League sides.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Ryan Giggs feels there is a “massive plus” at Manchester United despite the club losing some of their key players to the African Cup of Nations in December.",
      "United played their last game with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in the squad for a while, in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday. Noussair Mazraoui was not even able to play that, with Morocco not allowing the Red Devils to pick him in the squad.",
      "The aforementioned trio have left for AFCON, with the earliest date they are likely to return the beginning of January, as the group stages end on the final day of December.",
      "Mbeumo has been one of United’s very best players this term, and the other absent players have also been of use.",
      "As such, the seventh-placed Premier League club will be somewhat worried about their fixtures without the trio, given there are a couple of tough tasks in their next two games: Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "United legend Giggs feels there’s cause for optimism despite losing three top players, though.",
      "“[Benjamin] Sesko is now back, which helps. But it’s definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it’s going to be tough.",
      "“But with Sesko coming back, [Matheus] Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "“I’m not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don’t go through the group stage, and we don’t miss them for too long.",
      "“The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that’s a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they’re playing regularly.",
      "“And now we’re starting to see the Mason Mount that we’ve seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He’s a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you’re a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.”",

      "But a move for the Bournemouth midfielder won’t be plain sailing, with Chelsea and Tottenham both giving United competition.",
      "Each of the aforementioned clubs are said to be closely monitoring Adams, per Caught Offside, and the Blues’ connection could spell trouble for other interested clubs.",

      "The USA midfielder revealed how close he was to joining the Blues recently.",
      "He said: “I was very close. I was in London ready for the move to happen but some things fell through one way. A lot of people have to sign off on certain things for a transfer to happen and one thing fell through so they went with other options. So I ended up at Bournemouth, which I couldn’t be more happy about now.”",

      "It’s evident that Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are the favoured midfield pair, and Mainoo knows he’s never going to displace the former.",

      "But United legend Giggs has urged patience from Mainoo, after his former team-mates Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt suggested he should leave.",
      "He told Metro: “I can see where the lads [Scholes and Butt] are coming from.",
      "“As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United. It’s like a striker. You don’t see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "“We all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient. He’s still young, he’s still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",
      "Giggs does feel manager Ruben Amorim has shown a willingness to pick young players, though.",
      "He said: [Ayden] Heaven has played in some really tough games lately at centre-half, which isn’t easy. So you are seeing the manager picking a 19-year-old. Recently, Shea Lacey was on the bench, who is only 18. So the manager has played young players.",
      "“But it depends on what the manager sees every day. Because I was given a chance when I was younger. I always give young players a chance because they’ll never let you down and will do exactly what you say.",
      "“United have got a massive history of academy players coming through, but they’ve got to be good enough. They’ve got to be good enough. You can’t just have a philosophy of playing young players who aren’t good enough. That can’t happen.",

      "Every summer, as soon as the last competitive ball is kicked, football turns into a glossy travelling circus. Clubs criss-cross the globe in search of broadcast exposure, commercial partnerships and, increasingly, the kind of international branding that even mega-corps like Amazon and Google might think was a bit much.",
      "The modern pre-season tour has become a pillar of elite football’s economy. Yet as the miles stretch further, the environmental cost grows heavier. The contradiction is now impossible to ignore: the sport’s most aggressively globalised tradition is also one of its biggest carbon headaches.",
      "The distances involved are staggering. Manchester United‘s 2023 tour, for example, included stops in Edinburgh, Oslo, New Jersey, San Diego, Houston and Las Vegas. According to publicly available flight data for comparable routes, such a journey easily exceeds 20,000 kilometres of air travel. Long-haul flights remain one of football’s most carbon-intensive activities, with aviation consistently identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a major emissions source.",
      "Find out where your team ranks in the Pledgeball table!",
      "United are hardly alone. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool regularly venture to the United States. Spurs and Newcastle visited Australia barely minutes after the 2023-24 season finished, a single trip that – based on standard aviation emissions calculations for London-Melbourne return flights – produced several tonnes of CO₂ per person, before factoring in staff, equipment and internal travel.",
      "Clubs argue, often fairly, that these tours are commercial imperatives. The Premier League’s overseas broadcasting deals now dwarf domestic packages and international fan engagement translates directly into revenue. There is also a strategic logic: the United States and Southeast Asia are enormous growth markets. As long as sponsors and rights-holders prioritise global visibility, clubs will feel compelled to keep hopping across continents. Put simply, the machine pays too well to slow down.",
      "But the climate reality is moving faster than football’s commercial model. The United Nations Environment Programme has repeatedly highlighted the disproportionate emissions from international sport travel, while UEFA and FIFA’s own sustainability reports acknowledge travel as the single largest contributor to tournament footprints. The contradiction is baked into the structure of elite football. Clubs publicly commit to net-zero strategies, yet continue participating in a pre-season system designed to maximise miles, not minimise emissions.",
      "Some clubs are beginning to take tentative steps toward a different model. Brighton & Hove Albion have opted for more Europe-based pre-seasons in recent years, reducing long-haul flights while still accessing competitive opponents. Brentford have explored hybrid approaches, mixing local training camps with short-haul travel. FC Copenhagen, one of the more progressive clubs in Scandinavia, have publicly discussed avoiding unnecessary long-distance travel outside major competitions. These decisions are often framed as performance-oriented – shorter travel equals better recovery – but the environmental benefits are obvious.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "A handful of clubs have experimented with centralised training hubs, a concept borrowed from American sports. Instead of flying from city to city for friendlies, teams gather in a single region or country, reducing the number of long-haul flights required. It is not a perfect solution, but it is measurably better than zig-zagging across continents. Another emerging idea is the “festival” model: several clubs gathering in one location for a mini-tournament, cutting down on both miles and logistical complexity. The Premier League Summer Series in the United States has even inadvertently demonstrated this, grouping fixtures within a relatively contained region to reduce internal travel.",
      "The conversation is also shifting at governing-body level. UEFA’s 2030 environmental strategy stresses travel reduction and more efficient scheduling, though it stops short of regulating club tours. FIFA have commissioned sustainability studies for the expanded Club World Cup, which itself required enormous global travel. For all the talk of responsibility, binding restrictions remain rare. Football seldom limits what boosts revenue.",
      "The science, however, is unequivocal. Aviation emissions are among the most damaging forms of climate impact and long-haul flights generate significantly more CO₂ per passenger-kilometre than most other forms of transport. While clubs often offset flights through tree-planting schemes or certified credits, many climate researchers argue that offsets cannot substitute genuine emissions reductions. The most effective solution remains the simplest: fly less.",
      "This is where football’s commercial priorities clash with its environmental aspirations. Clubs promote recycled kits, solar panels, electric mowers and waste-reduction drives – programmes that are valuable, genuine and necessary. But none of them match the scale of emissions produced by a two-week global tour involving tens of thousands of kilometres in the air. It is the sustainability equivalent of bragging about reusable water bottles while taking a private jet to work.",
      "Still, this issue is not unsolvable. Football has reinvented itself before, sometimes dramatically, when commercial logic demanded it. The same machinery that built pre-season tours into a global brand vehicle could just as easily retool them into a lower-carbon model – if governing bodies, sponsors and clubs decide the reputational upside is worth it. As climate expectations tighten across every sector, that moment may be coming sooner than football anticipates.",
      "Until then, the sport’s most glamorous summer ritual remains one of its dirtiest secrets. The crowds, the content and the commercial gains will continue, but the climate cost will grow heavier each year.",
      "In an era when football increasingly markets itself as a vehicle for social betterment, its love affair with long-haul summer travel remains the one area in which the industry most clearly refuses to look in the mirror.",
      "To learn more about Pledgeball and how you can pledge to help your club shoot up the sustainability standings, visit Pledgeball.org.",
      "Mikel Arteta must be thrilled that his Arsenal players can time their shows of ‘unprofessionalism’ but also solidarity with struggling teammates so well.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Spurs and Liverpool need to stop playing out games in which the team reduced to nine men should have probably won. Richarlison made sense of the chaos.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Manchester City don’t half feel imperious after catching Arsenal despite Pep Guardiola saying they must improve. And Wolves really might go down.",
      "Gary Lineker is the ‘woke man scorned’ who is playing an incredibly extended and expensive long game in search of ‘revenge’ against the poor BBC."

      "Just as Christmas quickly rolls around every year, the same can be said for the winter transfer window.",
      "The summer window almost always overshadows its January equivalent, and this is likely to be the case this season after a few particularly hectic months in the sunshine, during which eight Premier League teams spent over £150m on signings.",
      "In the winter, there is typically an equal amount of noise, but not nearly as much action, with the window often descending into a snore-fest.",
      "This could easily be the case next month, but there are at least a few fascinating topics to be settled as Antoine Semenyo is among those at the heart of the conversation.",
      "If Erling Haaland was not performing at such an unbeatable level, Semenyo would be considered a serious contender for Player of the Season in the Premier League at this point in the campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has been great for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to a new level this term with ten goal involvements in 15 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "READ: Maresca ‘shock’ development, Amorim’s ‘handbrake’ problem and ‘woke’ Lineker’s incredible ‘revenge’ plan",
      "This is bittersweet for Bournemouth as they have reaped the rewards of his stellar performances this term, but it also means that he will soon be playing his football elsewhere.",
      "This is especially the case because Semenyo has a reasonable £65m release clause in his current contract, which reportedly becomes active for a brief time in January.",
      "And the intense competition for his services is another reason why an exit next month already feels pretty inevitable, with several outlets naming Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur as the clubs vying for his signature.",
      "For the reasons mentioned above, this level of interest in Semenyo is hardly surprising, and on current form, he would immediately go into the starting XI of these teams upon joining.",
      "But which of these five teams will win the race to acquire Semenyo next month? And possibly more importantly, what will the four rejected sides do instead?",
      "Well, starting with Semenyo, each of these clubs has been leading the race to sign him at some stage over the last month, but that is obviously not the reality.",
      "Instead, the truth is in what was initially reported about Semenyo before Arsenal, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs seemingly came charging in, with this perhaps a case of the player’s agent engineering a bidding war by feeding false updates to the media.",
      "You perceptive readers will notice that Liverpool are not mentioned in the previous line; this is because they remain, as they always have been, the likely winner to sign Semenyo.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n* Big Weekend: Tottenham v Liverpool, Aston Villa, Martin Odegaard, Enzo Maresca\n* Transfer power ranking: Guehi, Baleba, Anderson among non-Big Six stars most likely to leave in 2026\n* Five-year net spend table sees Man Utd top ahead of January transfer window",
      "This is not only because The Guardian’s Jamie Jackson has reported that the winger ‘favours’ Liverpool. A move to Anfield just makes the most sense.",
      "Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes, formerly of Bournemouth, has a relationship with Semenyo and already helped the Premier League giants sign former teammate Milos Kerkez in the summer.",
      "The Reds are well-stocked up front with Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, but they are nowhere near as strong in wide positions, and this situation has been made worse by Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo’s disappointing form.",
      "Semenyo certainly fits the Liverpool mould for what they want from wingers, and he is also capable of playing on either flank.",
      "This signing would be a significant boost for Liverpool, especially if Salah leaves, but the centre-back department remains a more pressing concern for Slot due to a lack of options and the declines suffered by Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Marc Guehi, as he was in the summer, is the most obvious fix to this problem, but Liverpool could suffer more disappointment regarding this transfer in the winter.",
      "After Liverpool messed around in the summer, the world is Guehi’s oyster, so he would be foolish to accept a move in January and give up a potentially massive signing-on fee at the end of the season. So they will likely have to settle for Semenyo as their only marquee signing in the winter, which is not to be sniffed at.",
      "As for the other clubs, there have been murmurs about Arsenal doing a bit of business to ease their injury issues, though this “problem” cannot be used as an excuse for potentially another failed Premier League title challenge.",
      "This is also the case because it seems like there will be no notable departees as Mikel Arteta slams the exit door shut, preventing Gabriel Jesus, Ethan Nwaneri, Myles Lewis-Skelly and co. from moving for more game time.",
      "So with Arsenal already having the most complete squad in the Premier League, they have no real need to enter the market in January and surely won’t unless their injury issues suddenly worsen.",
      "Man City, too, are unlikely to do anything regarding incomings, though they are probably second to Liverpool in the running for Semenyo.",
      "Semenyo would obviously be a great addition, but they already have Jeremy Doku in Semenyo’s natural position. His performances have ranged from good to exceptional this season, so they are covered.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "But unlike City and Arsenal, Spurs are in a far weaker position with their options in the final third.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side are said to be pulling out all of the stops to sign Semenyo, but this will likely ultimately fail to sign the winger.",
      "Instead, as David Ornstein has mentioned, it is foreseeable that they return for Man City star Savinho as an alternative after targeting him in the summer, with the winger currently only a bit-part player at the Etihad.",
      "And finally, Manchester United’s supposed interest is not a shock as they lingered in the summer before signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha instead of spending £80m on Semenyo.",
      "Man Utd certainly could do with Semenyo as they are already too reliant on Mbeumo and Cunha, but Liverpool are ahead of their rivals in the pecking order for good reason.",
      "So with Semenyo likely heading elsewhere, Man Utd’s window should be more low-key, with potentially only one in and one out.",
      "This would be in the midfield department, with a loan for Kobbie Mainoo said to be dependent on Man Utd signing a replacement, who will be a Conor Gallagher or a Ruben Neves, before getting their chequebook out for Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and/or Adam Wharton in the summer.",
      "Now, feel free to hibernate for the entire January transfer window, because you already know which transfers will and won’t happen involving five of the Big Six. You’re welcome…",
      "Antoine Semenyo scored but it proved to not be enough after a late Burnley equaliser.",
      "Liverpool have been told by former player John Barnes not to attempt sign Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window as focus would be better spent elsewhere.\nReports of a…",
      "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah could leave in the January transfer window if Antoine Semenyo arrives at Anfield from Bournemouth, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United want to sign Antoine Semenyo from Premier League rivals AFC Bournemouth as they have ‘doubts’ about a current star.",
      "Man City have reportedly leapt ahead of Premier League rivals Liverpool and Man Utd in the race to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth in January.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that they will ‘go all out’ for Liverpool and Manchester City target Antoine Semenyo in January."

      "According to reports, Manchester United want to sign Antoine Semenyo from Premier League rivals AFC Bournemouth as they have ‘doubts’ about a current star.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, grabbing seven goals and three assists in his 15 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "The 25-year-old is expected to leave Bournemouth in January as his £65m release clause, which reduces to £50m in the summer, becomes active next month.",
      "He is also well-placed to secure a move to a Big Six club, with recent reports indicating Man Utd, Man City, Liverpool and Spurs are vying for his signature.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with Semenyo in the summer, but they were priced out of a £80m move for the winger and opted to sign Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha instead.",
      "READ: Maresca ‘shock’ development, Amorim’s ‘handbrake’ problem and ‘woke’ Lineker’s incredible ‘revenge’ plan",
      "However, they remain keen on signing Semenyo as his release clause makes him a more affordable option, with it suggested that he could fit into Ruben Amorim’s preferred system as a wing-back.",
      "A new report from The Sun claims Man Utd are ‘weighing up’ a move for Semenyo in January, as they have ‘doubts’ about Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Dorgu joined Man Utd during this year’s winter transfer window for around £29m, but he has struggled for the Premier League giants over the past few months.",
      "The 21-year-old is still pretty raw and his performances have been inconsistent for Man Utd, with Amorim often preferring Diogo Dalot at left wing-back this season.",
      "The report from The Sun says Semenyo is their ‘prime target’ to be an upgrade on Dorgu, with it felt that he is the ‘ideal profile’ to fix the ‘problem position’.",
      "Regarding Dorgu, the report adds: ‘Well-placed sources believe United have overexposed Dorgu as he should have been recruited as a squad player.",
      "‘Another United source suggested Dorgu had been “ruined” by a chastening first-year experience at Old Trafford.’",
      "In a recent interview, Amorim revealed he is aware that Dorgu has been playing for Man Utd with “anxiety”.",
      "“When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games,” Amorim revealed.",
      "“Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland [this month], the decision that he made under pressure was completely different [to calmly sidefoot home] to the decision[s] he’s making in our team.",
      "“You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo scored but it proved to not be enough after a late Burnley equaliser.",

      "Villa arrive on a nine-match winning run in all competitions and have won every home game during that stretch, including victories over Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "United make the trip after a chaotic 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday night, a game they were fortunate to escape from with a point after conceding several late chances.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side remain difficult to beat, having lost just once in their last 10 league games, but the fixture list has been kind and Villa Park represents a very different test.",
      "Villa’s momentum has been built largely at home, where they have now won nine straight matches and collected 40 Premier League points in 2025.",
      "United also arrive without several key players, including Casemiro through suspension, and three regular starters now away at AFCON.",
      "Villa come into the weekend in strong shape, with Emery able to stick closely to the side that has powered their recent run.",
      "Morgan Rogers continues to play a key role in the final third and arrives after scoring twice at West Ham, including a long-range winner.",
      "Ollie Watkins is expected to lead the line again, supported by a settled midfield that has given Villa control in recent home games.",
      "(4-2-3-1) Bizot; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Onana; Tielemans, McGinn, Rogers; Watkins",

      "Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui are also unavailable due to Africa Cup of Nations duty, reducing Amorim’s options in wide areas.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain major doubts, meaning Ayden Heaven is likely to continue in defence alongside Luke Shaw.",
      "(3-4-2-1) Lammens; Yoro, Heaven, Shaw; Dalot, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu; Fernandes, Mount; Cunha",
      "– Aston Villa have won their last six Premier League games and their last nine in all competitions.",
      "– Villa have won nine straight home games in all competitions and could record their fewest home league defeats in a calendar year since 1983 if they avoid defeat here.",
      "– Only Manchester City (46) have won more home Premier League points in 2025 than Villa (40).",
      "– Villa have won just one of their last 26 Premier League home games against Man Utd, beating them 3-1 in Unai Emery’s first match in charge.",
      "– Manchester United have won their last two away Premier League games, last winning three in a row in February 2024.",
      "– United have scored at least twice in each of their last five away league matches.",
      "– United have dropped 10 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.",
      "– Bruno Fernandes has assisted in each of his last five away league appearances and could set a Premier League record with another here.",
      "Villa’s home form, overall direction, and level of confidence against a leaky Man Utd side missing depth make odds about 11/10 appealing.",
      "They have won nine in a row at Villa Park and fear no team at home.",
      "United’s recent run is good on paper, but they were opened up repeatedly by Bournemouth and needed big saves late on to avoid defeat. Villa are better placed to punish that kind of defending.",
      "The absence of Mbeumo and Diallo puts more pressure on Fernandes and Cunha to carry United’s attack, while Villa remain settled and confident across the pitch.",
      "Villa to win looks the right call here, especially at home, where Emery’s side continue to set the tempo and control games. Back Villa to win at 11/10.",
      "Morgan Rogers is also worth a bet of some description. We say back him to score or assist at 1/1.",
      "He has been directly involved in eight goals in his last 11 league games and is playing with confidence again.",
      "Rogers had five attempts against West Ham and has recorded at least three shots in five of his last 10 league appearances."

      "Man Utd could be set for a huge windfall with Barcelona weighing up whether to make an offer for Marseille forward Mason Greenwood, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new arrivals in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim in the market.",
      "Man Utd put most of their energy into improving their attack after being the fifth lowest goalscorers in the Premier League last term.",
      "Many supporters and former players were frustrated that Man Utd failed to sign a new midfielder over the summer with the position an obvious area for improvement.",
      "And now there are rumours that they will definitely attempt to sign a midfielder in January but could have to leave a big-money signing until the summer.",
      "But a potential sale of Greenwood could boost their coffers over the next couple of transfer windows as strong interest from Barcelona has been revealed.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "Man Utd have a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal to sell Greenwood to Marseille and our friends at TEAMtalk claim that Barca are ‘weighing up a surprise move’ for the former England international.",
      "There are rumours that Marseille could demand as much as £100m for Greenwood after contributing 14 goals and four assists in 21 matches in all competitions.",
      "TEAMtalk add: ‘Sources indicate keen interest from the Catalan giants, who see Greenwood’s technical finesse and goalscoring instinct as a fit for their attacking ethos.’",
      "Marseille president Pablo Longoria recently explained how they can increase their economic rights of Greenwood by qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Longoria said: “On the contractual situation, OM has 60 per cent of the economic rights of the player, 100 per cent of the sports rights with a possibility in case of qualification in the Champions League, to increase by five per cent to reach 65 per cent. We are very happy with Mason’s evolution. It is a daily work of everyone to the athlete, especially in the evolution of his game. We know his talent but the work that De Zerbi does with him is extraordinary.",
      "He added: “Mason is working to improve his level and the way he sees football collectively, which is his biggest evolution. We are aware of having a very important player who puts himself at the service of the collective, we want a continuity with him. It’s hard to have some key players, but you need a collective.”",
      "Marseille head coach Roberto de Zerbi reckons Greenwood has the ability to win the Ballon d’Or one day.",
      "De Zerbi said earlier this month: “I see him every day, he has a huge potential. I don’t see any other players in Europe at the same level. He has the potential to win the Ballon d’Or. It will be up to him to decide whether he wants to do everything he can to fight for it or not.",
      "“At the level of the qualities that nature has given him, that his parents have given him, I think he is worthy of the Ballon d’Or.",
      "“I would like him to be more consistent. I know he needs to press with more intensity, he needs to manage the ball better when the team is in trouble, not lose the ball easily but keep it to allow the team to move up because he has the ability to do it.”",
      "On why he is harder on Greenwood than others, De Zerbi added: “The important thing is that he understands it in three or four years. Not necessarily now, when I will no longer train. When he remembers me, he will say, ‘ah, it was the coach who really took my head every day, but maybe in the end I managed to progress.’",

      "“If Man Utd look outside the Premier League for a Bruno replacement, then I would expect Angelo Stiller [who is rated at £52m] to be in the mix as a target.",
      "“For some time now, I have been hearing his name mentioned as a target, but always with the caveat that he would replace Kobbie Mainoo or Fernandes.",
      "“At this rate, both players look like they might leave soon, so at a time when Man Utd want more tenacity in the centre of the field, I think Stiller might come into conversations.",
      "“Stiller can play in a deep midfield role, but also create, and if they find another midfielder to go in there too, which will be the plan, then they can start looking at a long-term plan.”"

      "Mainoo looked lively when brought on in Monday's chaotic 4-4 draw against Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore an eye-catching 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt.",
      "The stunt went viral and Amorim says there is no issue with the England international, only a desire for the player to kick on and prove his worth.",
      "\"He's a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility,\" Amorim said. \"He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, so I'm just focused on that.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something in the internet and I have to answer for that.",
      "\"My explanation is, 'He has his life, he has his opinion, it's nothing to do with me', so I will do the same with Kobbie.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that it's not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.",
      "\"I remember (Cristiano) Ronaldo was on the bench, (Wayne) Rooney was on the bench sometimes. (Juan Sebastian) Veron was not playing.",
      "\"I remember all the history of Manchester United and (there is) nobody this didn't fall (to), so let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.",
      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "\"Believe it or not, I just want to want to help the team to win and help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",
      "Amorim says Mainoo may start in Sunday's trip to Aston Villa, with United without six first-team players due to a mixture of injury, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations action.",
      "\"I don't want to show anything to anyone,\" Amorim said. \"I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that, if you do things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "Amorim revealed he could perhaps switch to a back four rather than keep his preferred three-man system to cope with absentees during the festive period.",
      "With the transfer window opening next month, Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, whom the manager last week called a \"special player\", is among those of interest as United continue their attempts to build for long-term success.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said when asked if the club had told him there is money for January business.",
      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "\"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. It's not going to be like that.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",

      "Sunday 21 December 2025 07:03, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called EVERY match result correct on Saturday, going eight from eight with the accumulator paying 1,200/1 - can he stay perfect?",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 13:26, UK",
      "He may be in his third season at Old Trafford, but it finally seems that Manchester United fans are starting to see the best of Mason Mount.",
      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""
