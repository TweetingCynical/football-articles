      "Manchester United are looking ahead to the summer transfer window as their season draws to a close - but not before they battle Tottenham for the Europa League trophy next Wednesday.",
      "The Red Devils will hope they can put their miserable season behind them by winning the silverware that will put them in the Champions League - and possibly secure them some more lucrative signings in the process.",
      "United will be targeting a new midfielder and forward next term, but will be restricted by the club's difficult financial position, as well as PSR regulations.",
      "However, club officials will already be hard at work assessing targets before the transfer market swings open in July.",
      "United will be eager to strengthen their forward line this summer after growing frustrated with the lack of clinical finishing from Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund up front and they might have just been given an answer to their problems.",
      "The Red Devils have eyed up Lille striker Jonathan David for quite some time and now the Canada international will be available on a free transfer this summer, with his contract set to expire in June.",
      "We know United won't have huge amounts of cash to spend this summer so bargains like this one will be vital to a successful transfer window.",
      "David has declared his intention to leave on the club, which should put United chiefs on red alert knowing a talented striker - who netted 25 goals this season - is up for grabs.",
      "\"I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club, it's time for me to say goodbye,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram.",
      "\"I've spent five wonderful seasons here, I know it hasn't always been easy, but I hope that with my goals and celebrations, I've managed to bring you some joy, especially with the French championship title and the Champions Trophy.\"",
      "Should David or another forward come in, it could result in a swift exit for Zirkzee, who has come under intense scrutiny from fans and pundits this season.",
      "After joining from Bologna for around £35m last summer, Zirkzee has struggled to adapt at Old Trafford as the lone striker, only managing three goals in the Premier League from 32 appearances.",
      "There has since been speculation he could be allowed to leave and now Inter Milan are reportedly willing to rescue him from his nightmare in Manchester.",
      "According to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport, Inter are interested in signing Zirkzee on loan for the 2025-26 season before potentially signing him permanently should his spell go to plan.",
      "Zirkzee might have better success playing in Simone Inzaghi's system, even though he also plays a 3-4-3 system - like Ruben Amorim.",
      "One of the biggest question marks in United's squad at present is undoubtedly Marcus Rashford - whose future at Old Trafford looks untenable so long as Amorim is in charge.",
      "Rashford fell out with the Portuguese boss over his work rate and after giving a bombshell interview declaring his desire to leave, before sealing a short loan to Aston Villa.",
      "The England international has impressed at Villa Park with four goals and five assists after being revitalised by boss Unai Emery, but has since suffered a season-ending injury and returned to United for treatment.",
      "Now United will be eager to cash as much as possible on Rashford - who has wages of around £325,000-a-week.",
      "Villa's deal with United includes a £40m option to buy - and the player himself believes the club will accept such a deal.",
      "It comes despite United officials slapping a £100m price tag on the forward last summer, which saw PSG back out of a move, with the club now set to settle for a much lower fee."

      "Ruben Amorim has crashed to a fresh low in his disastrous reign in charge of Manchester United, with the Red Devils now winless in eight Premier League games. It is a new unwanted club record for Amorim's miserable side.",
      "The record was set by a poor defeat to Chelsea on Friday night. To make matters worse, United were playing in front of controlling co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who was in the stands at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim had named a strong side for the trip to the capital, somewhat surprisingly ahead of next week's Europa League final. But the visitors were blunt in attack and offered little of note.",
      "The Blues secured all three points thanks to a late header from Marc Cucurella. The Spanish left-back lost his marker to powerfully head home an excellent cross from captain Reece James.",
      "The defeat leaves United down in 16th place, 27 points behind fifth place Aston Villa and a giagantic 44 adrift of champions Liverpool. It also means that Amorim has set a fresh mark among United's worst-ever managers.",
      "The loss at Stamford Bridge was their 18th league defeat, their most in a season since losing 20 in the 1973/1974 campaign when they were relegated. United have also now gone eight league games without a win, a club record in the Premier League.",
      "It is their worst run since an 11-game winless run between December 1989 and February 1990. The run started with a defeat at Nottingham Forest, before a draw with Manchester City and a hammering at Newcastle.",
      "They were then beaten by struggling Wolves before being held by 10-man Bournemouth. Their last three games have all ended in defeat, against Brentford, West Ham and now Chelsea.",
      "It is Amorim's second run of losing three successive Premier League matches with United. He also achieved the awful feat in December. That is one only one fewer run of three consecutive defeats than Sir Alex Ferguson had across his 810 games in the competition.",
      "More concerningly for Ratcliffe is the fact that since the start of April, United have won fewer points than any other Premier League side, drawing two and losing six of eight games in that time.",
      "In a clear sign where their make weakness lies, the Red Devils have now failed to score in the first half of 26 Premier League matches this season, their most-ever in a single campaign. Indeed, no side has failed to score in more first halves this season.",
      "\"You can forgive teams for losing, but when the manager is coming up most weeks and is scratching his head. Amorim's head is spinning from being Man Utd manager. I get why he thought: I didn't want to get into that mess [until the summer].",
      "\"He will be glad to see the back of this season. Some of the games, they have just written off. I've never heard so much chat from this club about next week's game. Don't think for one minute that this team is going to be top four or top five.",
      "\"They've lost 17 games this season, but they lost 14 last year. It's not just this season. This team just doesn't know how to compete. This is the bit I don't get. Turning up week in week out is the sign of greatness. And these players? Every week they don't know how to compete.\""

      "It will go right to the wire. But Chelsea have got their Champions League fate back in their own hands after a topsy turvy night at Stamford Bridge. Marc Cucurella was the unlikely hero with a 71st minute winner to push Chelsea back up to fourth and to leave European qualification on a knife edge.",
      "It was Cucurella’s fifth goal of the season and yet this could be his most precious of all with a prize of playing on Europe’s biggest stage at stake.",
      "They now have to go to Nottingham Forest on the final day knowing that victory will put them in next season’s Champions League. It was a rollercoaster because Chelsea do look like a bag of nerves and struggled to break down Manchester United’s stubborn resistance.",
      "United of course still have the Europa League final and a passport into the Champions League if they can beat Tottenham in Bilbao in five days’ time. This was hardly great preparation for United because it is now eight Premier League games without a win for Ruben Amorim’s men.",
      "But they have put all their eggs in the Champions League basket even if they really went for it at Stamford Bridge as Amorim clearly wants his players fresh and fired up rather than rested. You also cannot fault the Manchester United fans for their unwavering support and belief.",
      "The travelling faithful chanted Ruben Amorim’s name with their now familiar song about the United boss bringing back the glory days and turning the club around.",
      "On this evidence, Amorim will also need to be a miracle worker because, despite a bright start in both halves, they do look an unruly rabble lacking in direction.",
      "United were near full strength and thought they had gone ahead after 15 minutes when Bruno Fernandes whipped a brilliant, teasing ball into the box, Harry Maguire steered it into the net but VAR intervened to give the tightest of offside decisions.",
      "It was fast and furious as Reece James’ brilliant 20 yard drive hit the outside of the post with United keeper Andre Onana beaten all ends up.",
      "The home fans were booing United’s ex-Chelsea star Mason Mount’s every touch after his defection to Old Trafford two years ago and they were giving their own keeper similar treatment.",
      "Mount missed a big chance and Chelsea were far from in charge as the away fans cheered their men on. Chelsea fans are getting restless and even Cole Palmer could not break the deadlock when his curling 20 yard shot was saved by Andre Onana.",
      "United had almighty scare when referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after Onana appeared to upend Chelsea youngster Tyrique George but VAR overturned it.",
      "Chelsea were getting desperate - and then Cucurella stepped up. With England boss Thomas Tuchel looking on, James turned and created some space on the edge of the box. James’ floated cross found Cucurella headed into the far corner for a brilliant and priceless winner.",
      "Noni Madueke missed a big chance to make it 2-0 and settle nerves but you get the feeling that this will be a nail biting finish to the season no matter what. At least now Chelsea have their fate in their own hands."

      "The game came alive after the break, with both teams seeing penalty shouts waved away by referee Chris Kavanagh. But Cucurella proved to be the hero, powering a header past Andre Onana from Reece James' cross.",

      "While Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou opted to rest a number of his top stars ahead of the Europa League final, United chief Ruben Amorim went in a different direction. He instead opted to select a full-strength squad for the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire all featured for the Red Devils. It was a huge risk for Amorim to take, given the significance of next week's final.",
      "Win in Bilbao and United will qualify for the Champions League. While Amorim may be focusing on keeping his side match sharp, it was a puzzling choice to include so many top stars. His side may even suffer a hit to their vulnerable morale having slipped to an 18th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Moises Caicedo was a surprising absentee from the shortlist for the Premier League's Player of the Year award. The midfielder has been a driving force behind the Blues' push for Champions League qualification this season.",
      "But Ryan Gravenberch, Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Declan Rice, Alexander Isak, Bryan Mbeumo, Chris Wood and Morgan Gibbs-White were instead the eight men selected to battle it out.",
      "Caicedo showed up whoever left his name off the list in style, running the show from midfield. He completed 94 percent of his passes, made seven recoveries and won five of his defensive duels.",
      "Young players from both Chelsea and United have clearly been picking up some bad habits. First, Blues starlet Tyrique George threw himself to the ground while trying to round Andre Onana.",
      "Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, but he overturned his decision after replays showed Onana had got the ball and George was falling before being touched. Minutes later United star Amad earned a place in Kavanagh's bad books.",
      "The winger went down in the box while trying to slalom past a number of Chelsea defenders. Kavanagh booked the United man with replays showing he had not been touched.",
      "Just when the game appeared to be petering out into a bore draw, Marc Cucurella popped up to rescue Chelsea's season. The left-back pulled away from his marker Noussair Mazraoui to find space in the United box.",
      "He then leapt high before powering in Reece James' cross with a brilliant header. The ball flew past Andre Onana and into the net, with Cucurella racing away to celebrate.",
      "It was a goal that could prove to be crucial to Chelsea's hopes of claiming Champions League qualification. And it continues Cucurella's run of only scoring in Premier League wins this season."

      "It was a little more than 12 months ago that Ten Hag was all but set to record United's first victory at Stamford Bridge in more than four years. Two Alejandro Garnacho goals either side of a Bruno Fernandes finish put the visitors 3-2 up when officials announced eight minutes of added time, which led to an incensed reaction from Ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman's disappointment deepened when Cole Palmer netted twice in the 100th and 101st minutes to give the Blues a dramatic 4-3 win. United left west London with their tails between their legs, and Ten Hag made his displeasure clear by darting down the tunnel at full time without shaking then-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino's hand.",
      "Both clubs have seen significant change since then, with Amorim now at the United helm and Enzo Maresca in charge of Chelsea. Yet despite this transition, little has improved for United in the 14 months or so since that match.",
      "United are due to clash against Tottenham in the Europa League final next Wednesday, providing an opportunity to redeem their historically poor campaign. Nevertheless, there's a debate whether even victory in Bilbao can cast Amorim's first half-year at the helm in a more positive light.",
      "United's recent 2-0 home defeat to West Ham was yet another indication things are far from rosy at Old Trafford. This season has seen the club suffer nine home defeats in the league; only four other teams have suffered more, three of whom have been relegated.",
      "The Red Devils' vulnerability was on show when they surrendered an early lead in a dramatic 4-3 defeat to Brentford earlier in May. Similar opportunities to secure wins against teams like Arsenal, Lyon, and Liverpool have slipped through their fingers in recent months, evidence of a worrying trend towards fragility in the team.",
      "When asked how it feels to be languishing in 16th with just two games to go, Amorim said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept. I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here.",
      "\"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club. We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "The former Sporting CP boss might not be anticipating any miracles at Stamford Bridge despite some impressive performances away from home this season. And Amorim would be hard-pressed to give a more disappointing response than his predecessor should things not go United's way once more."

      "Despite witnessing Erik ten Hag squander a 3-2 lead against Chelsea last season, Sir Jim Ratcliffe opted to keep faith in the Dutch manager.",
      "The INEOS boss, who secured a stake in Manchester United in February 2024, was seen with a stony expression at Stamford Bridge during a Premier League clash last April. With the Red Devils undergoing a rather uninspiring season, and Ten Hag's capacity to deliver results coming under close inspection, the defeat could have been pivotal in deciding his future amid new investment-led restructuring.",
      "United let their advantage gained from Alejandro Garnacho's double and a Bruno Fernandes effort slip late into stoppage time when Cole Palmer netted a penalty before scoring again a minute later to snatch victory for Chelsea in dramatic fashion.",
      "Many supporters might have presumed Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford was doomed, especially after United ended the season at an all-time low eighth position in the Premier League, but grasping the FA Cup title at the expense of local rivals Manchester City potentially postponed any immediate managerial changes.",
      "Even so, Ten Hag would have felt the heat, particularly considering the comments of Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff upon Ratcliffe's entry, noting that he and INEOS, who own a share of the Formula 1 team, favour a no-nonsense approach. Wolff said: \"This is a no bull**** organisation.",
      "\"They are huge in terms of revenue and profit. Decisions are being made quickly – three bullet points on a page and 'here we go.' With Jim, all the bull**** is cut out.\"",
      "In a candid interview with Belgian newspaper De Tijd last February, Ratcliffe also shared his vision for Manchester United, saying: \"We have to look at the organisation of the club, because it is not good at the moment. Take the head coach, for example: he must report directly to the CEO. That is no longer possible in a modern football organisation. We have to ensure that the right people end up in the right positions.",
      "\"Every person in management must be world-class. And then it is important to create a positive, supportive, friendly and high-quality environment. That culture was missing before. Only in such an environment can you get the best out of sportsmen. If successful, the results will follow automatically. That's the plan, and I believe in it.\"",
      "Despite a less-than-stellar season and whispers of Gareth Southgate and Zinedine Zidane potentially taking over at Old Trafford, Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy gave their support to Ten Hag for the 2024/25 campaign. They extended his contract until June 2026 and provided him with a substantial transfer kitty to enhance his team.",
      "Despite reportedly shelling out £36.5million for Joshua Zirkzee, £42m for Manuel Ugarte, £52m for Leny Yoro, £49.2m for Matthijs de Ligt, and £17m for Noussair Mazraoui, Ten Hag couldn't turn things around at the start of the current season - managing just three wins in his first nine matches before being given the boot following a 2-1 defeat by West Ham in October. He was succeeded by Ruben Amorim the following month.",
      "Fast forward to May 2025, and Ratcliffe will certainly be keeping a close eye on his team this Friday evening, as they once again head to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. It's been a truly woeful season for the Red Devils that many supporters will be eager to put behind them, with the club currently languishing in 16th place in the league table with a mere 10 victories to their name.",
      "However, there is a glimmer of hope as United could still clinch the Europa League trophy, with a struggling Tottenham standing between them and victory in Wednesday's final. A win would secure them a spot in the Champions League, but a significant shake-up is needed this summer if Amorim hopes to compete in the tournament and restore United to Premier League prominence, especially as his current squad, inherited from Ten Hag, has struggled to adapt to his distinctive style of play."

      "Nottingham Forest have easily established themselves as the overachieving side in the Premier League and for a very good reason. Going into the season, many bookies priced Forest as more likely to be in a relegation battle - again - than to find themselves in a position in Europe.",
      "Yet, that is exactly where Forest find themselves and for some corners of the fan base they might even find themselves frustrated if they do not find themselves in UEFA's top-tier club competition given how well they have done this season. Nuno Espirito Santo's side have spent more than half the season in the top five - where Champions League qualification is guaranteed - in the Premier League this season but have since dropped out picking up just one win in their last six appearances.",
      "Forest are still within a chance of getting a place in the Champions League - even though they are guaranteed a place in Europe though which competition is yet to be confirmed - sitting just one point below Chelsea who are in fifth with Villa on the same 63-points tally above the Reds too.",
      "Going into the penultimate weekend, Forest fans will be eagerly looking at Friday night's selection of Premier League matches with Europa League finalists Man United and Tottenham Hotspur both looking to make the most of the extra day's preparation for Bilbao but for Forest it will mean so much more if both sides get a respective result in this one.",
      "18+ | Gamble responsibly | gambleaware.org | Odds subject to change | (CopyBet)",
      "Starting off, Forest need both Villa and Chelsea to drop points at the very least and that will mean Spurs need to turn up the gears against Aston Villa who will be looking to make the most of the situation. Spurs have lost 20 times in the Premier League already this season and Ange Postecoglou will no doubt be prioritising the final in Bilbao which makes this a tough task for Forest fans.",
      "Spurs have won just once in their last 10 league outings despite finding themselves in a position to be in the Champions League group stages next season if they win in Bilbao. Even if a draw is hopeful, they still have only picked up two draws in the same time too - making this a difficult task at hand.",
      "Equally, Forest fans need the result at Stamford Bridge to go their way as Manchester United face Chelsea - who could really put themselves in the driving seat to return to the Champions League stage for the first time in three years. The Blues will be looking to make the most of the situation and put pressure on the likes of Man City and Arsenal above them going into the last day of the season.",
      "Of course, none of the aforementioned outcomes matter unless Forest do the business at the London Stadium against another incredibly underwhelming side, West Ham.

      "There was a time when Viktor Gyokeres could not get a kick for Brighton and Hove Albion - now the Sporting Lisbon colossus is being chased by Arsenal and Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres, 26, has established himself as one of the best strikers in world football over the last two years. At Brighton and while on loan at Swansea City, Gyokeres' opportunities were few and far between, particularly when he was at the Amex Stadium.",
      "After finding his goal-scoring range at Coventry City, Sporting took a chance on the Swede by signing him from the Sky Blues for £20million. Two-years later, he could soon be on his way to Arsenal, as the North Londoners have reportedly offered him a contract worth £7million a year after tax.",
      "Now he is in the headlines, several of his former team-mates and opponents spoke to French outlet RMC Sport to offer their thoughts on Gyokeres at the time, as well as what they make of him now. Ex-Huddersfield and Reading defender Naby Sarr, who faced him on multiple occasions, said: \"I dealt with two Gyokeres'. The first was already tough and strong, despite a lot of shortcomings.",
      "\"It was easy to stop him, his game was very readable. In the end, it was no longer the same story. He became ultra-complete, one of the best players I've faced. Speed, power, efficiency, technical accuracy... he worked on all these aspects.\"",
      "He added: \"What sets him apart from the others is that he's not lazy. His mindset has always been to tell himself that no ball is unplayable. Even if he seems unexploitable and is five meters behind, he'll go for it. He's poison.\"",
      "Other players who shared a dressing room with the Scandinavian recall a player who was friendly, humble, and hard-working, but often limited by his capabilities. One of those stars was Gaetan Bong, who played alongside Gyokeres at Brighton, when the striker was struggling to find the net.",
      "Bong, who retired in 2022, admitted he has been baffled by Gyokeres' ascent, saying: \"I remember seeing this unassuming guy arrive in the dressing room. It was surprising to see him there because Brighton were used to recruiting players in his position who were quick and easy on the ball.",
      "\"He already had an imposing physique, but how can I put it... Technically and in his finishing, it was... mediocre. He was far from the level of Glenn Murray, for example, who was our starting No.9.",
      "\"That day, we were working on free kicks and I saw the discreet Viktor coming into my zone. I was often given the strongest guys to mark me, so at the time I was calm and I told myself that I was going to try to intimidate him, just to welcome him.",
      "\"I grabbed his arm, I tried to move it, and there... wow! I saw that he was resisting. A wall! He had a lot of strength. I said to myself: 'OK, he's going to have to work hard, but at least he has a response, he's not there to be walked all over, and in duels he has what it takes.' It was a first good point.\"",
      "The same concerns were echoed by former Coventry colleague Maxime Biamou, who pointed out similar flaws in Gyokeres' game. Taking those into account, the Frenchman added: \"There was no indication that he was going to explode one day.\"",
      "Ironically, Gyokeres' biggest weakness in his development years was, in the opinion of ex-Coventry midfielder Wesley Jobello, his shooting and goal-scoring instincts, the very things he is a master off today. Jobello said: \"In matches, he had this way of charging head first, without asking any questions.",
      "\"He tried a lot and didn't care if he made a mistake. Right foot, left foot, he sent some serious concrete blocks, but it wasn't often on target.\"",
      "This season alone, Gyokeres has hammered 52 goals and 13 assists in just 50 appearances in all competitions. Arsenal, who are desperate for a striker, have been heavily linked with a move, while a reunion with Ruben Amorim at United has also been mentioned.",
      "What is for certain is that Gyokeres has terrified defences this season and intends on continuing to do so, whatever club he is at."

      "Arsenal are set to make a move for a new striker in the summer transfer window, but could face a tough decision over which of their top targets to pursue. RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has been one of the leading names mentioned to solve the club's problem position.",
      "The Gunners have not lived up to expectations in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta's squad are 15 points adrift of champions Liverpool and are battling to maintain second place ahead of their match against Newcastle United this weekend.",
      "Much of the criticism has been directed at Arsenal's inability to sign a striker, either last summer or in the January window. The issue was made worse by injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus. RB Leipzig star Sesko is one of the main names being linked with filling the number nine spot, but two obstacles could stop him from making a move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The Independent has reported that Arsenal are still weighing up whether to go for Sesko or Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres. The latter has maintained his impressive form in Portugal, scoring 52 goals in 50 appearances, while Sesko has scored 21 times for a struggling Leipzig team.",
      "Sesko, 21, is five years younger than Gyokeres and could offer better value for Arsenal's money in the long-term. However, Sporting striker Gyokeres is seen as more of a finished product and is reportedly available for around £60million.",
      "The arrival of Andrea Berta as Arsenal's sporting director has reignited speculation over the club's pursuit of former Coventry City star Gyokeres. This is despite the Independent reporting that the majority of necessary groundwork has already been completed to secure Sesko's services.",
      "Arsenal expressed interest in Sesko last summer but opted not to proceed until the transfer of Eddie Nketiah to Crystal Palace was confirmed. By then, Sesko had agreed to an extension with RB Leipzig, who are facing the possibility of a season without European competition.",
      "Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic previously justified his client's decision to stay at Leipzig. When asked earlier in the season if Sesko was the solution to Arsenal's striker issue, Basanovic replied: \"I think you should ask Mr. Arteta about that. But I think Sesko could suit many clubs because he has different football skills,\" he told Slovenian TV channel Arena Sport.",
      "Basanovic shared the reasoning behind Sesko's new deal: \"We can see that our decision was correct. Six months later, he is already a better striker than he was last season,\" he said.",
      "\"What he lacks is experience. We must not forget that he is only 21 years old, so we did not want him to go to the Premier League in the summer. There were concrete options, but we consciously decided to stay in the Bundesliga to give him time to progress and develop into a better striker.\"",
      "Arsenal's focus on signing a centre-forward could inadvertently benefit Manchester United's summer transfer plans. Both United and the Gunners have been linked with Wolves star Matheus Cunha in recent months.",
      "While Arsenal remain interested in the Brazil international, it is Ruben Amorim's side who are widely reported to be winning the race for his signature. Cunha has scored 15 goals in 31 league games for Wolves this season.",
      "United will be eager to freshen up their attacking options as their forwards have struggled to score goals consistently. Bruno Fernandes is the club's top scorer in the Premier League with eight.",
      "Meanwhile, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are still on Arsenal's watchlist, albeit further down than Sesko and Gyokeres. However, despite the club's fondness for the striker, a potential transfer for Newcastle's Alexander Isak seems improbable."

      "No other job in football carries the stress and anxiety of a manager. From Ruben Amorim to Nathan Jones, we’ve seen that pressure bubble to the surface this week, and the business end of the season does strange things to the psyche and demeanour of bosses feeling the heat.",
      "Amorim’s admission that Manchester United’s Premier League results on his watch have been “embarrassing” and questioning whether they are ready for Champions League football next season if they win the Europa League may have been honest. But some things in football are best left unsaid, or kept behind closed doors.",
      "Whether you are a head coach answerable to a director of football, or a manager in charge of the whole football operation, you are the face of a club, the man who carries the hopes of your fans and conveys them to the players.",
      "When things are going well, you take the plaudits. When they go badly, you take the responsibility - but you are the one empowered to do something about it.",
      "If you blame others before you have looked in the mirror, whether you operate in the Northern Premier League or the Champions League, maybe self-awareness is not your strongest suit.",
      "Amorim’s public statements were no doubt fuelled by raw emotion, but it’s reached the stage now where the only language United fans really want to hear is the vocabulary of a winner. If he lifts the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on Wednesday night, more than anything it will be a release of pressure.",
      "That pressure valve also best explains Jones’ behaviour on the touchline after Charlton’s tense League One play-off semi-final win against Wycombe on Thursday night.",
      "Kneeling in prayer before the final whistle, and then bursting into tears on all fours, was the portrait of a manager overwhelmed by relief and euphoria.",
      "But it makes you wonder how Jones will manage to contain his emotions if Charlton beat Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley!",
      "And it’s a reminder that this is the time of year when managers stand or fall on nine months of hard graft. For some, the season will end in triumph - but for others, like Ruben Selles at Hull, it ends harshly.",
      "I have no idea why Hull sacked Selles after he kept them in the Championship on the final day. What was his remit if it wasn’t to save them from relegation?",
      "This is the club who sacked Liam Rosenior last year - and he is on the brink of leading French club Strasbourg, Arsene Wenger’s former team, into Europe. Being a football manager is just about the only profession where people openly debate whether you should be fired.",
      "It’s the only profession where ‘experts’ on the outside pontificate on the job you’ve done when they don’t know half of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.",
      "Some pundits who have never been a manager have all the answers when they have never set foot inside a technical area. Others might have dipped their toe in the water for a few games, been unsuccessful and returned to the sofa because possibly it’s harder than it looks and maybe it’s not for them.",
      "Unless you have been at the sharp end, even if I only lasted five minutes, it’s a job like no other. But above all, to be a football manager you need personality, you need to communicate - even lower down the pyramid.",
      "Would you rather manage at my level, where you won’t go any higher if you keep making mistakes, or work at an EFL club where you might be thrust into a job and get another two or three opportunities even if you fail in the first one?",
      "At Macclesfield, we have enjoyed a record-breaking season and I have agreed a two-year contract nine months after putting my neck on the block by admitting my job would be untenable if we didn’t win promotion.",
      "But my first season as a manager has been an eye-opener like no other experience after almost 35 years in the game. Even at a non-League level, I can identify with the pressure Amorim, Jones and others have felt this week. And we wouldn’t swap it for the comfort zone in a million years."

It's unbelievable.\" On his own podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, the former defender theorised that Amroim could be looking to execute a significant shakeup of the squad.",

The Manchester United legend is fronting a nationwide campaign to help Sunday league teams who play on lunar landscapes with barely-distinguishable line markings, or surfaces pockmarked by dogs ’ mess and broken glass, to enjoy smarter, safer pitches.",
      "Neville, 50, said: “Anyone who has played football at one point or another has played on a dodgy pitch. Grassroots football is the foundation of our sport and it’s great to be a part of the Best Worst Pitch initiative supporting the communities and volunteers who make it possible.”",
      "This weekend’s FA Cup final and the all-English Europa League final in Bilbao will be played on pristine surfaces. But on the bottom rungs of the ladder, hard-up councils are stretched for financial resources to provide professional line-painting equipment, GPS mapping, pitch maintenance equipment and ground staff training.",

Their current ‘champions’ are Somerset League strugglers Tunley Athletic, whose chairman Craig Doughty admitted: “It’s a real slog sometimes - every week, rain or shine, I’m out there doing two full laps of the pitch just to get the lines marked.",
      "\"The equipment we’ve got is ancient—it clogs, it leaks, and it takes twice as long as it should. On dark evenings or when the wind’s howling, it feels like it takes forever. But I do it because I love this club—it means everything to the community.”",
      "Where professional football was once played on pitches resembling Amazon swamps, or sandy beaches after the tide has gone out, most clubs in all four divisions enjoy billiard-table surfaces.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been named the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award and in doing so makes Manchester United history. The United skipper has become the third player to win the award a record four times - albeit the club had no end of the season gig for him to claim it.",
      "Fernandes has been a standout in has been a dire season, often carrying the team during their period of prolonged struggles. The Portuguese playmaker has stood up during the team's European campaign and could help the side end the year as Europa League winners.",
      "He's continued to come up trumps in the final third and has 38 goal involvements - 19 goals and 19 assists - across his 54 games. But that has come amid a desperate domestic season that has United currently sat in 16th - by far their worst ever Premier League showing.",
      "Traditionally United hold a huge gala dinner at Old Trafford for the men's, women's and youth teams at the end of each campaign, with awards handed out to the best performers of the season, but club bosses opted against one this term. Instead of the dinner it is expected that the awards will be handed out on the Old Trafford pitch prior to the club's final game of the season at home to Aston Villa.",
      "Fernandes will still receive his individual accolade and it means he's landed the Player of the Year gong on four occasions - the same amount of David De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "The decision to cancel the ceremony did receive some negative responses, considering the women's side secured a top-four finish and reached the FA Cup final, which will be played this weekend. It also prevented the club's youngsters from going on stage to pick up their honours, with Harry Amass named Young Player of the Year.",
      "De Gea enjoyed a purple patch where he continued to be voted on top. He won it four times in five years with his first coming in 2014. Cristiano Ronaldo also won it four times, doing so in 2004, 2007 and 2008 before adding another during his second stint in Manchester.",
      "Fernandes' wins came in 2020, 2021 and 2024 and he dominated the voting this time round with Amad in second and Harry Maguire in third. Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Brian McClair, Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy are the only other men with multiple Player of the Year victories since it was first awarded in 1988, bearing the name of their iconic manager.",
      "Fernandes' quality has led to talk of interest from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal are ready to lodge a hefty offer, but the Premier League side have no plans to their talisman. The Saudi Pro League club have the funds for a mega signing after Mohamed Salah decided to stay at Liverpool, with talks being held about pursuing the Portugal star.",
      "It is understood there was initial contact between the two parties last year before Fernandes signed a new contract to keep him in Manchester until 2027.",
      "Only last month Ruben Amorim rejected the possibility of his talisman leaving for - underlining his importance as the club's captain and leading light. He said: \"No, it's not going to happen. He's not going anywhere because I've already told him!\""

      "Chelsea's preparations for their Premier League match against Manchester United have been dealt a blow with the news that Christopher Nkunku won't be fit to return. The Blues were already without the suspended Nicolas Jackson, and both they and their opponents are well below full-strength for Friday's game.",
      "Jackson was sent off last weekend as Chelsea lost to Newcastle to leave their Champions League qualification hopes in jeopardy. Anything less than two wins from the final two games will leave the door open for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest, with the latter hosting Enzo Maresca's team on the final day.",
      "Jackson and Nkunku are two of 16 players missing from across the two squads. The latter was already expected to sit the game out, having also missed the victory over Liverpool, but Maresca confirmed as much in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"Christo is close to coming back and training with us,\" Maresca told reporters. \"I said two weeks ago it was a very small problem, ten days, two weeks. Probably next week he can start already with us.\"",
      "Nkunku and Jackson are among several Chelsea players missing for the game, but Reece James is available to play a part. Maresca confirmed the club captain has recovered from illness, but others will have to wait to make their returns.",
      "Chelsea striker Marc Guiu has been out injured since February. He's now back in training but Maresca confirmed he isn't fit to start on Friday - and he might not be ready to feature at all.",
      "Wesley Fofana and Omari Kellyman are out for the season through injury, while Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended and Jadon Sancho is unable to face his parent club. Young defender Aaron Anselmino is another injury doubt while James' recent illness means that - while he could feature - Chelsea may decide not to risk him.",
      "As for Manchester United, Lisandro Martinez and Joshua Zirkzee are unavailable due to season-ending injuries. Leny Yoro is also unlikely to be back in time after being forced off in last week's defeat to West Ham, while there are question marks over Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "With a Europa League final coming up against Tottenham on Wednesday, United boss Ruben Amorim may opt against risking others who have only recently returned to training. That means Toby Collyer and Jonny Evans could get another game to recover if not required at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amorim was also asked about Luke Shaw, having withdrawn the defender at the same time as Yoro last weekend, but indicated he was keen to protect the defender amid a tough time for injuries around the club this term. \"It’s not what it’s going to be, it’s the history,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We have to manage the minutes, like Mason Mount. Mason Mount is ready, but we are trying to build these guys a little bit longer for them to cope. Then, in the future, they will be okay.”"

      "Manchester United could take a £60million loss on Marcus Rashford in the space of a year with the forward believing they may let him leave for £40m. The academy graduate is on loan at Aston Villa, but faces an uncertain future once the season ends.",
      "The 27-year-old moved to Villa Park in February in a loan deal that included a £40m option-to-buy clause. That however does not prevent any other club signing the forward, whose time in the Midlands will come to an end on 30 June.",
      "Rashford has rediscovered his form whilst playing under Unai Emery and that may have put him back in the shop window. He struggled to strike up a relationship with Ruben Amorim and the Manchester outfit may decide to cut their losses.",
      "If they do their timing could cost them huge sums. Only last summer Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co slapped a £100m price tag on the forward. That figure was enough to see PSG back out of potentially signing the player, who could now leave for well below his previous market value.",
      "United have struggled over the years to time their business right with a number of players leaving once their values had plummeted - some of them recouping no fee whatsoever.",
      "Paul Pogba endured a mixed time at the club but interest in him often remained and he flirted with the exit door. The Red Devils often stuck to their stance that he wasn't for sale, but he later left in the summer of 2022 for nothing when his contract expired.",
      "Jesse Lingard was once linked with a £25m move to West Ham, but the Hammers chose not to pay the fee and the player later left for nothing. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was once valued at £40m - as per the Daily Star - but later joined Crystal Palace for half of that.",
      "Rashford could be the latest star to leave and ultimately cost United big sums. He is unlikely to have much of a future at his boyhood club whilst Amorim is in charge with the Portuguese boss casting him out soon after arriving in Manchester.",
      "\"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" said the United boss after his exit. \"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\""

      "Manchester United have the chance to sign Jonathan David on a free transfer this summer after he confirmed that he's leaving Lille. David, 25, won't sign a new contract with the French club and move on to pastures new when his current deal expires on June 30.",
      "The Canadian striker has been linked with United alongside a host of European giants for many years, having impressed for Lille ever since his move from Gent in 2020. David lifted the Ligue 1 title in his first season and has scored 109 goals in 231 games for Les Dogues, putting him third in the club's all-time goalscorer charts.",
      "That kind of output would be ideal for United, who've prioritised signing a striker in the summer transfer window. The Red Devils want an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who've scored a combined 17 goals this season compared to David's 25.",
      "The 25-year-old has also chipped in with 12 assists, as Lille head into the final day on Saturday battling for fourth place which would earn them a spot in the Europa League. But if they qualify, David won't be a part of it.",
      "\"I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club, it's time for me to say goodbye,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram. \"I've spent five wonderful seasons here, I know it hasn't always been easy, but I hope that with my goals and celebrations, I've managed to bring you some joy, especially with the French championship title and the Champions Trophy.\"",
      "Thanking his team-mates, David added: \"I know I didn't have the easiest start, but you've always been behind me, you've supported me through the tough times, and for that, I'll keep you in my heart.\"",
      "The Canada international has most recently been linked with Napoli as well as Barcelona and Newcastle. David isn't the only striker on United's radar either, with Liam Delap understood to be their No.1 target and available for £30million following Ipswich's relegation.",
      "But the fact that United wouldn't have to pay a fee for David could sway them. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear the Red Devils are in a precarious financial position which makes winning the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday even more important, as it'd guarantee them a place in next season's Champions League which is worth roughly £100m."

      "The Manchester United supporters were certain to turn up at Stamford Bridge. True to their Premier League form, the players did not.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, the most senior United players, rounded on Alejandro Garnacho immediately after Marc Cucurella broke the deadlock in the 71st minute. Garnacho had been on the pitch for less than two minutes and he was about as much of an obstacle as a training cone for Reece James, who danced past him and whipped the ball in for his fellow full back.",
      "Such indolence could have major ramifications for Garnacho. It felt telling he was benched for the second game running for the first time since early January. All signs now point towards Mason Mount retaining his place in Bilbao on Wednesday over a forward who lined up for the 14th successive match last week.",
      "Ruben Amorim has agonised over pragmatic and proactive styles at United. In the Europa League, he has erred on the side of the former and it has served him well. This possible dress rehearsal could convince him not to dress up the United team against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "It would not be particularly palatable for United's supporters to have Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, the matchwinners of last year's FA Cup final and academy products, sat in the dugout. But it is a means to an end and you can hardly blame Amorim with the season on the line.",
      "He picked a team that could conceivably line up again in Bilbao. Fernandes and Maguire, two totemic players, combined for United's standout piece of play all night. The trouble was Maguire had strayed marginally offside for his striker's finish.",
      "And so another record tumbles. United are eight games without a league win for the first time since January 1990. It is 18 league defeats for the season, a -12 goal difference and 15th match without scoring. They are only marooned in 16th as Tottenham also lost.",
      "\"Follow, follow, follow\" segues seamlessly to \"Hollow, hollow, hollow\", a chant United supporters have aired to bait Chelsea for 18 years. They dusted off 'Viva John Terry' again, a reminder of their last Champions League triumph and headier days.",
      "Chelsea have their own European final and could qualify for the Champions League. You would have thought United were in a more auspicious position in the table until Cucurella connected with James' cross.",
      "Aston Villa's victory over Tottenham, and their temporary ascent to fifth at Chelsea's expense, was all but confirmed at half-time. That did not improve the mood at a club where the friction between matchgoers and coach is palpable. Enzo Maresca got so hot under the collar in the first half that he removed his jacket.",
      "Chelsea resorted to desperate measures as the young striker Tyrique George threw himself to the turf amid the onrushing Andre Onana. Referee Chris Kavanagh signalled a penalty but the replay made its overturn inevitable.",
      "Amorim and Maresca were arm-in-arm. Willy Caballero, the former Manchester City goalkeeper, continued to remonstrate and was urged to watch a replay on the big screen by Amorim. That barely elicited a murmur from Chelsea fans.",
      "It was only after Amorim made changes with Wednesday in mind that Chelsea capitalised. Casemiro had been a solid shield all night and Mount's best work is often off the ball. The same cannot be said of Garnacho.",
      "The die had been cast with Patrick Dorgu pitted against James. Dorgu, like his fellow Dane Rasmus Hojlund, is a 20-year-old first-teamer who ought to be playing second fiddle. He has suffered in the absence of Diogo Dalot on the opposite flank.",
      "Maresca and captain James billed the game as \"big\" in their programme notes. Amorim's selection ensured the edge would not be completely taken off United's own performance.",
      "So did his demanding demeanour on the touchline. He clapped his hands on three separate occasions to prompt the United backline to advance and went ballistic over an aimless pass by Dorgu. Amorim, shaking his head, turned away from the pitch to bemoan Dorgu's shortcomings to his staff.",
      "It was Amorim's assistant's turn to despair at Dorgu in the second half. Carlos Fernandes hollered Dorgu's name repeatedly as United prepared for a set piece yet his voice did not carry. It did coincide with a rendition of 'Follow, follow, follow'.",
      "Amorim has a kindred spirit in his compatriot and captain. Fernandes glared at Hojlund for selling him short with a pass and, come the next stoppage, rebuked the Dane. There was also a piqued pirouette from Amorim after Onana went short, rather than long, with the ball. United progressed the ball from their own third yet it was inevitably lost when they pinged the ball forward for Hojlund.",
      "Frustration got the better of Hojlund, who used Mount as a sympathetic sounding board. Mount offered him an encouraging pat on the head. Mount was treated to some applause when he came on at his former club last year. His starting status did not afford him that privilege this time.",
      "The booing for the Chelsea Champions League winner was louder and more caustic. The Matthew Harding Stand sang, \"Chelsea reject\". Cole Palmer was the \"City reject\".",
      "Mount was responsible for United's only official attempt at goal in the first half that ended up nearer the corner flag. He went closer in the second but was quick not to dwell on the missed opportunity yards away from frothing Chelsea supporters. Amorim gave Mount a hearty hug and pat when he removed him in the 70th minute.",
      "Garnacho, his replacement, is still one of the few players who is serenaded by the matchgoers, as he discovered when he embarked on his first warm up in the 38th minute. The night nevertheless ended as it started: with a rendition of 'Follow, follow, follow'.",
      "The supporters had turned up."

      "There will be five additional minutes at the end of this first half.",
      "Chelsea defender James is down on the deck and needing medical attention after clashing with Dorgu.",
      "Fernandes wasn't happy with Hojlund there for selling him short with the pass. He shot him a glare and then rebuked him during the stoppage. It has been an all-too-familiar half from Hojlund.",
      "Maguire and Fernandes have been the pick of the United players. Casemiro has had a steady half, too, when his good form has been restricted to the Europa League. Chelsea, for a team in danger of dropping out of the top five, have not felt as switched on as United.",
      "With five minutes to go until half-time, it's Chelsea who are applying all of the pressure. United are struggling to get out of their own half at the moment."

      "Manchester United warmed up for next week's Europa League final by losing 1-0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to suffer their 18th defeat of a dreadful Premier League season.",
      "Fernandes calls out Hojlund",
      "This was another game that showed Rasmus Hojlund's limitations as United's No.9. He was easily outfought by Chelsea centre-back Tosin Adarabioyo, who won almost every duel the two of them contested.",
      "Hojlund also didn't do enough sharp work on the ground, and one loose lay-off to Fernandes in the first half summed it up. He should have found the captain with time to play a forward ball to get United moving, but he left a simple pass short and Fernandes had to rush his pass, which was blocked.",
      "The midfielder glared at Hojlund as he retreated into shape and when the ball then went out of play, he rebuked United's No.9. It was another game that passed him by.",
      "He received the ball in a dangerous position during a good spell early in the second half, but was then ponderous in possession and the move broke down. A minute later, Fernandes was under pressure in midfield and had no out-ball. When he was dispossessed, he reacted furiously at Hojlund, who had been stationary rather than giving him an option.",
      "It was a reminder why a striker is right at the top of United's shopping list this summer, with £30million Liam Delap leading the race to lead the line next season.",
      "Onana gets away with one",
      "Enzo Fernandez would have been relieved to see the offside flag go up after he blazed over the rebound from Cole Palmer's shot late in the first half, but Andre Onana would also have been delighted to see Fernandez spoon his effort over the bar.",
      "Onana's save from Palmer's deflected shot looked spectacular, but it didn't need to be. The ball was spinning, and it looked like the goalkeeper got his timing wrong. In the end, he simply palmed the ball straight back into his six-yard box, presenting Fernandez with a big chance.",
      "Thankfully for Onana, the Argentine made a mess of it and the flag was up anyway, but it was a reminder of the little issues that continue to crop up in Onana's game.",
      "Maguire disappointed",
      "Harry Maguire has made a habit of popping up with late goals this season and has done a passable impression of a striker at times. He was still playing centre-back when he slammed in a half-volley from Fernandes' cross and then celebrated as if it was an everyday occurrence.",
      "You could tell it was a great goal and a superb strike from a player not noted for that sort of connection, because the United subs were on their feet and craning their necks to get a replay, with coach Adelio Candido in charge of the tablet.",
      "When that replay was viewed, it looked like Maguire might have been marginally offside. As VAR Craig Pawson reviewed the footage, Maguire looked over to the bench for information, and Amorim responded with a gesture that told him it was tight.",
      "Maguire probably knew what was coming next and his head slumped when he realised his sweet strike was being chalked off.",
      "Mount booing",
      "Chelsea fans gave Mason Mount a tougher time in his second return to Stamford Bridge than they did on his first game back last season, when he came on for the final four minutes of a madcap 4-3 defeat. Mount came on when United led 3-2 and walked off after they had contrived to throw the game away.",
      "The difference now is that he's in the best moment of his United career and returned not only feeling fit and in form, but with the chance to really stake a claim to start the Europa League final next week.",
      "So he was always likely to cop a bit more flak this time around, although in truth it doesn't really make a lot of sense. He left Chelsea for a good transfer fee and gave excellent service to the club. It's hard to see why they have such an issue with him.",
      "Away end",
      "It was another superb United away end in the capital, with the Shed End vista for visiting fans an excellent one these days at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The atmosphere was outstanding throughout and even after watching defeat No.18 of the Premier League season, they applauded the players and sang about adventures to come in Bilbao."

      "Another mea culpa for Manchester United. The sight of a defeated, disgruntled squad standing apologetically in front of supporters who had again given them backing they couldn't live up to has been a familiar one this season.",
      "For the 18th time in the Premier League, United were beaten. This one doesn't even come close to entering the top 10 for embarrassments this term and, in many ways, they will just be happy to have escaped intact. But it was a familiar feeling and a familiar sight.",
      "Having spent much of the game serenading Ruben Amorim and singing about Bilbao, the away end broke into 'We love United' at full-time. It felt telling. It was another reminder that they are sticking with the team despite a league table that makes for painful and shameful viewing. But then, this was never close to being the main event over the next week.",
      "United could have been forgiven for just being glad this game was over. There were no injuries, no damaging loss of confidence, and no damage done. They didn't play like a team with both eyes elsewhere, but their Premier League season has been without a pulse for months.",
      "European adventures have kept the fires burning, and one more awaits on Wednesday. Amorim will protest otherwise, and he is clearly embarrassed about a record of just six wins from his 26 Premier League games in charge, but this was a match Chelsea had to win, and United had to survive - which they did.",
      "The clear blue skies and soaring temperatures made West London feel like Bilbao on Friday night. It was actually hotter in West London than in the Basque Country and the weather will again be better in Manchester next week, not that it will stop the travelling hordes from enjoying them.",
      "You could hear United fans chanting about going to Bilbao from late afternoon around Earl's Court. It was the first song to get an airing once the game had kicked off at Stamford Bridge. The atmosphere from that corner of the Shed End never relented after that.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou had taken the decision to rest some key players at Villa Park, Amorim had gone strong at Chelsea. You would expect at least nine of this starting XI to start the Europa League final.",
      "That made avoiding injuries the priority, and the sight of Bruno Fernandes twice hitting the deck inside the first eight minutes would have been an unsettling one on the United bench. Harry Maguire and Amad also suffered knocks to the face and ankle, but were able to continue without treatment.",
      "It showed the competitiveness was still there for a team whose priority had clearly shifted as this season had gone on. They looked more assured in this game than they have in many Premier League assignments and grew in confidence as well.",
      "They mustered just one first-half shot, a Mason Mount effort on the stretch that drifted well wide. But they were better after the break, got more men forward and posed more of a threat. Mount should have done better after one slick attack with Amad and Fernandes fired over after Amad had again caused problems with his runs down the left.",
      "When Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho came on for the final quarter, with Casemiro and Mount making way, it felt like the final auditions for places in Amorim's team next week were underway.",
      "That pair might have felt they were certain starters a couple of weeks ago, but the picture has changed. Amad has returned looking as sharp as he was before his three-month lay-off, and Mount is in the best spell of his form since his £60million move from Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro would appear a certain starter, having saved his best for Europe this season. He has been looking more secure domestically and it was probably no surprise that when he was withdrawn at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea began to turn the screw and took the lead a couple of minutes later.",
      "Ugarte would expect to start as well, even if his own performances recently have dipped, although with Tottenham's three most creative midfielders also likely to be absent, there would be an argument to play only one of Casemiro and Ugarte.",
      "That would allow Amad and Garnacho to start as No.10s. Otherwise, it feels like they are either competing for the same spot in the team, or Amorim goes bold and restores the former to a wing-back role and drops Noussair Mazraoui to the centre of defence.",
      "The fitness of Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt must also be considered, and Amorim will be desperately hoping one of them can get back in time for the final. But in all likelihood, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, and Luke Shaw will start against Tottenham.",
      "When the teamsheet drops in Bilbao, you would expect to see Andre Onana, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Mazraoui, Casemiro, Dorgu, Fernandes and Hojlund. Ugarte, Mount, Garnacho and Amad might be scrapping it out for the other two places.",
      "On this evidence, Amad should be upgraded to a certain starter. He was again United's brightest attacker, both creatively and with testing Robert Sanchez as they chased an equaliser. Mark him down as the 10th starter. Now, it's down to Ugarte, Mount or Garnacho."

But the other thing I would say about that one, I don't know what Onana's doing. What is he doing? Just stay in your goal!\"",

He done that previously. We got to the right decision, but don't give him a chance. Mind your own business. Why is he coming out there? He just gets in touch, so he'll argue all day it's the right decision.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Alan Smith then added: Just as we were talking about changing the centre-forward, the youngster, has he come good here or has he taken a fall?",
      "\"[Andre] Onana knows which it is. Certainly, George gets a little toe to it but after that... I think it's a dive. Maybe anticipating the contact. 'Keeper certainly gets something of the ball. I don't think this is going to stand, you know. I don't think this is going to stand.\"",

      "Monday, December 30, appeared to be the night that Joshua Zirkzee would never recover from at Manchester United.",
      "With just two days remaining before the January transfer window opened, Zirkzee was jeered off the pitch by United supporters as he was replaced before half-time by Ruben Amorim against Newcastle. To be clear, no individual player covered themselves in glory that night but Zirkzee was not the worst player on that pitch.",
      "His reaction to the response from the crowd looked to have broken him. Visibly upset, he headed for the tunnel before re-emerging and watching the remainder of the game from the bench.",
      "It was hard to see how any player would recover from that never mind a player who had struggled so much until that point. Fast forward to the end of the season and while Zirkzee has been missing since April with an injury, you have to feel that United would be foolish to accept a £35m offer for him this summer.",
      "Corriere dello Sport understands that Inter Milan believe Zirkzee is a target for the summer to bolster their attack and would be willing to pay £35m plus bonuses for him. However, the catch is the first reason why United should reject the offer.",
      "It is understood they would like to loan him for the entirety of next season and then pay for the forward at the end of next season. Looking solely at the money, while £35m is a good offer for Zirkzee, there is very little to be gained from allowing the forward to play next season out on loan when the cash is needed now.",
      "There is no secret that United are in the midst of financial trouble and need to sell in order to fund a rebuild which is desperately needed. But the only benefit of agreeing to a loan with option to buy deal is that it would take Zirkzee's wage off the bill - that's it.",
      "There would be no added funds to the transfer budget and that seems foolish. Secondly, there is no great rush to let Zirkzee leave the club this summer.",
      "After the Newcastle incident, Zirkzee was used more and more as a No.10 in the Amorim 3-4-2-1 system. Suddenly, in a deeper role, he looked more comfortable and that could hugely benefit United moving forward.",
      "If £35m was put to United in the January transfer window, it may have been too tempting to turn down. However, as we head into the summer transfer window it feels like Zirkzee should be given a fresh slate next season, in the No.10 role on rotation to see how he does."

      "By contrast, United's two current forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have only managed seven Premier League goals between them this term.",
      "Hojlund, 22, and Zirkzee, 23, have struggled to flourish under the weight of expectation that is placed on a United forward and Scholes fears Delap, who is of a similar age profile to the pair, may also suffer similar woes at Old Trafford.",

      "Yet, under Amorim, United have won just six of their 26 league games, with their last coming against relegated Leicester City on March 16. Ferdinand has now explained how United's consistent poor run in the league has become such a formality that people outside of the club have become indifferent to the 20-time top-flight champions.",

There has to be a lot of things to go right for us to make a dramatic turn on this. He's coaching the team to understand what he wants, which has led to him getting terrible results in the Premier League consistently.",

      "Over Christmas, Zirkzee's spell at the club hit its lowest ebb when he was jeered off the pitch by home supporters as he was replaced before half-time in the defeat to Newcastle. From there, he managed to resurrect himself somewhat as he scored crucial goals in the Europa League and found his feet in the deeper No.10 role.",
      "Sadly, his progress was cut short when in the reverse fixture against Newcastle at St James' Park he pulled up with a hamstring injury which has ended his season. Despite not having everything his own way, Inter appear to be keen on the forward.",

      "Considering how Zirkzee has adapted to the 3-4-2-1 system, it is unclear whether United would be tempted by this proposal.

Amorim came good on his promise of picking a strong Manchester United XI against Chelsea in a bid to avoid them being caught cold in Bilbao, while injury fears prompted Postecoglou to play the Tottenham backups vs Aston Villa.",
      "This perceived injustice led to great gnashing of teeth from Blues fans, who had seen their side romp to a 3-1 win over a hungover Liverpool less than two weeks ago, up against a midfield trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "It wasn’t a walk at Villa Park anyway. Son Heung-min looked like something closer to his old self on a happy hunting ground that’s seen him score more Premier League goals as a visitor than any other player (6), swinging a curled effort just over the bar, while Wilson Odobert’s flick after an excellent counter-attacking move was well saved by Emiliano Martinez in a first half which saw the home fans grow increasingly nervy and quiet.",

The impact of George playing out of position as the No.9 paled in comparison to the suspended Nicolas Jackson, who’s a long way from perfect and an absolute fool for getting sent off against Newcastle, but is a handful for defenders even at his worst.",
      "Chelsea relied upon the only player to provide a moment of quality in the first half to come up trumps in the second. It was brilliant from James, who unsurprisingly impressed throughout at right-back because he’s a brilliant right-back and not a central midfielder, no matter how much Enzo Maresca tries to convince us he is.",

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",

Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",

He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",
      "",
      "LB: Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – 6.41\nJamie Carragher compared him to Wayne Rooney and Jude Bellingham, praising his “football arrogance” – and it’s been a pretty spectacular breakthrough season for Myles Lewis-Skelly. But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",
      "Still, the talent is obvious, and he looks every inch a long-term fixture in Arsenal’s defence for the next decade. Not a Young Player of the Year candidate, though, clearly.",

      "",
      "CM: Joe Willock (Newcastle) – 6.26\nFrom one Hale End graduate to another. Joe Willock has struggled for regular minutes in a Newcastle midfield that – when available – picks itself: Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton.",
      "With Joelinton ruled out for the season, Willock looked like the natural alternative. But after starts against Ipswich and Brighton, he didn’t feature at all in the win over Chelsea, with Anthony Gordon preferred in a reshuffled XI.",
      "The lack of consistent starts has dragged down his average rating, and Willock ends up with the second-lowest score in this XI – only Gray has fared statistically worse.",
      "",
      "CM: Christian Eriksen (Manchester United) – 6.41\nSet to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer, Christian Eriksen just scrapes into this XI with 11 starts and 22 Premier League appearances in 2024/25.",
      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",
      "",
      "RW: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa) – 6.42\nIn 23 Premier League appearances this season, Leon Bailey has managed a meagre one goal and two assists – and picked up more yellow cards (three) than either.",
      "Injuries continue to hamper the Jamaican, who took a step forward last term but hasn’t kicked on this time around. Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",
      "",
      "AM: Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United) – 6.32\nSigned from Bologna last summer to ease the burden on Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee looked an instant hit when he scored the winner on his debut against Fulham – but that was the high point for the Dutchman.",
      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) – 6.43\nVilla might feel hard done by having three players in this worst XI, but hey, life isn’t fair, and the algorithm doesn’t lie.",
      "Ramsey’s red card against Bournemouth last weekend didn’t do his average rating any favours, helping land him a spot in this unfortunate XI after making the worst team of the weekend.",
      "With one goal and five assists from 28 Premier League games in 2024/25, it’s a disappointing return for a player with top talent. Still, at 23, he’s one of the brightest young talents in Emery’s squad.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) – 6.27\nIt’s hard to say anything about Hojlund that hasn’t already been said – the young Dane frustrates United fans every week, doing everything possible to make his £70m price tag feel like yet another colossal transfer disaster at Old Trafford.",
      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "There has been a ‘huge twist’ in the future of Marcus Rashford, with Manchester United facing a ‘£60m loss’ after another ‘staggering blow’ financially.",
      "",
      "Rat race\n‘Ratcliffe loses £6.5 BILLION of total wealth in staggering blow for Man Utd and manager Amorim’s ambitious summer transfer plans,’ is a headline worthy of topping the Daily Mirror website on any day, so unequivocal it is in underlining just how financially screwed one of the world’s biggest clubs is.",
      "It is a ‘staggering blow’ and Ruben Amorim might as well throw his transfer ideas out of a window which is probably about to be made redundant.",
      "‘Ratcliffe was ranked fourth in the 2024 list and topped the standings in 2018,’ writes Senior Sports Reporter Fasika Zelealem. ‘But he has now fallen to become the seventh-richest individual in Britain, behind the likes of Sir James Dyson and Gopi Hinduja and family, who sits atop the list.’",
      "Christ. How embarrassing for Sir Jim to trail Sir James and only five other unthinkably rich people in Britain. There’ll be no Matheus Cunha then; I’ll tell the children.",
      "Ratcliffe wasn’t even in the top ten in 2021 or 2022 but this will undoubtedly bring shame upon his entire family.",
      "‘The INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year, was worth £23.519billion in the 2024 Rich List. However, that has now decreased by £6.473bn to £17.046bn.’",
      "There goes the Europa-winning BBQ. Although it does feel like a clue to explain some of those losses might be found in the sentence ‘the INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year…’.",
      "Maybe don’t wait up for a response.",
      "Is there any insight whatsoever into how this ‘staggering blow’ stands to ruin Ruben Amorim’s ‘ambitious summer transfer plans’? Of course not. Ratcliffe, the owner of 28.94% of Manchester United, and whose individual net worth remains about on par with that of Manchester City’s owners, will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "Reach the plummet\n‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe suffers a 10-figure loss in his fortune as Man United’s billionaire co-owner plummets down rich list after costly first year in charge,’ is how the MailOnline describe a fall from fourth to seventh.",
      "",
      "At a loss for words\nThere is further dreadful fiscal news for Manchester United from the Daily Mirror website as they ‘could take a £60million loss on Marcus Rashford in the space of a year’.",
      "Except valuing a player they absolutely didn’t want to sell at £100m in April 2024 and valuing a player they absolutely do want to sell at £40m in May 2025 is not really a ‘£60million loss’, is it? Especially in a pure profit sense.",
      "",
      "Rash decision\nThe Rashford stuff on Friday morning is funny as numerous outlets have parroted the same line fed to them about Rashford being available for £40m this summer.",
      "They all also seem desperate to wilfully misunderstand the point of a buy option, which it was widely reported Villa had when they loaned him.",
      "‘Marcus Rashford could move for £40m to a team other than Aston Villa should Manchester United receive a bid of this value despite the Midlands club having an option to buy him for that sum’ – Jamie Jackson, The Guardian.",

      "‘Marcus Rashford will be able to leave Manchester United for £40 million this summer but Aston Villa do not have first refusal on the England forward’ – James Ducker, Daily Telegraph.",
      "Mediawatch is being gaslit here. It has specifically only ever been said since they loaned him that Villa have a £40m buy option. No-one thought they had secured an obligation to buy or even first refusal on a deal for Rashford because that was never reported on or even vaguely alluded to at any point whatsoever over the last three months.",
      "So no, Villa do not have something no-one ever thought they did. Thanks for that. They also don’t have an obligation to buy Marco Asensio for £427m. Is that how this works?",
      "It’s just a bizarre non-update, typified by this nonsense Daily Mirror website headline:",
      "‘Manchester United name price for Marcus Rashford but summer exit takes huge twist’",
      "Manchester United named their price when Villa negotiated a £40m buy option in February. And that ‘huge twist’ is that said buy option is not a first option or indeed anything other than the sodding buy option everyone thought it was and has been told it was for months.",
      "Yet only now ‘it has emerged Villa do not have first option on the 27-year-old’? Do we need to be told everything privately by Rashford’s representatives for it to ’emerge’ now, no matter how obvious it was before?",

      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",
      "Amorim has recognised Amad’s talent immediately, and the former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has flourished in the 3-4-3 as one of the two wide No.10s.",
      "",
      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",
      "",
      "ST: Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) – 6.41\nNicolas Jackson would’ve made this XI, but he decided to smash Sven Botman’s jaw and is suspended. So it’s Nkunku by default.",
      "He only has three Premier League goals but remains Chelsea’s second-top scorer across all competitions with 14. A summer move is likely — Liverpool are reportedly sniffing.",

Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!).

It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "Late offsides and how to fix them\nI was fortunate enough to have an e-mail published in March’s mailbox about pet peeves, one of which was offside flags being given late for VAR to have the final say.  At the time, I wrote:",
      "Who’s going to admit culpability when a player inevitably gets injured in a “phase of play” that should never have been allowed to continue because an offside wasn’t given in time?",
      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",

      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",

      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 01:24, UK",
      "Chelsea held their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification as Marc Cucurella’s second-half header secured a 1-0 win over Manchester United to send them fourth.",
      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Chelsea: Sanchez (7), James (8), Tosin (7), Colwill (8), Cucurella (8), Caicedo (8), Enzo (7), Palmer (7), Madueke (6), George (6), Neto (6).\n\n\nUsed subs:  Gusto (6), Lavia (6).\n\n\nMan Utd Onana (6), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Shaw (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (5), Amad (6), Mount (6), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nUsed subs: Garnacho (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Moises Caicedo.",
      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and can push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "\"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving.",
      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""

      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",

      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",

      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",
      "\"What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards. I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say something and take responsibility,\" he added.",
      "\"I have a clear plan of what to do. I understand the problems of the team.\"",
      "But the United boss, far more upbeat than in the aftermath of the defeat to West Ham, warned \"we need to perform or else they will change us\".",
      "Amorim also confirmed he had agreed to pay for his backroom staff to go to next week's Europa League final after reports claimed the club would not be covering the cost of their tickets.",
      "This is just the latest cost-cutting measure implemented under United's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen more than 400 redundancies since taking control of football operations from the Glazer family.",
      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",
      "\"We have had a lot of people leaving and a lot of changes in our staff,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"In our club at the moment it is sometimes hard to understand when to take and when to give and to respect the people when we have taken their jobs to survive and rebuild.",
      "\"It is complicated for the club to give to other members of staff, so it is a really hard position.",
      "\"That situation was explained and my reaction was to help because - I am not a good guy - it is not going to change my life. The players had the same reaction.",

      "The 26-year-old has made 51 appearances for United this term in all competitions but last month suffered a potentially season-ending calf injury.",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad,\" Amorim said. \"I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, second injury [follows] and then it's a big thing.",
      "\"We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad, so we will see but he's working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I am working really hard, you can imagine how much I want to be back as soon as possible,\" he said."
