      "Cristiano Ronaldo has opened up about the secret behind his football longevity, as he continues to break records at the age of 40.",
      "It's fair to say the Manchester United legend doesn't know the meaning of rest - and retirement is nowhere near the forefront of his mind. The all-time top scorer in football history, who now has 950 goals for club and country, remains determined to reach the 1,000-goal milestone and add to his 34 major trophies.",
      "Ronaldo is still delivering for Al Nassr, netting seven goals in eight games in all competitions so far this season. His sights remain firmly set on the 2026 World Cup - the one major honour still missing from his distinguished career.",
      "\"I want to keep playing for a few more years - not many, to be honest,\" he admitted earlier this month. \"I'm still producing good things, helping my club and my country. So why stop now?\"",
      "On a separate occasion, he described sleep and a regular routine as two of the most important 'tools' behind his success on the pitch.",
      "\"Sleep is the most important tool that I have,\" he said. \"To be consistent with the time that I go to bed and that I wake up.",
      "\"I mean, like example, I go to bed around 11-12 and I wake up around 8.30. It is my routine. It is the most important thing that we have probably in terms of health-span.\"",
      "Former United teammate Danny Simpson also believes the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's story is far from over, adding that two key targets continue to drive him to play well into his mid-40s.",
      "\"I don't think you can write him off,\" the former right-back told Goal. \"As long as he is scoring goals, as long as he doesn't get any injuries, then it wouldn't surprise me because it's him.",
      "\"I know he wants 1000 goals. And I think he wants to play with his son. Playing with your son, that's probably one of the biggest targets that you can go for once you have won everything.",
      "\"Sharing a pitch with your son must be some feeling. You look at those targets. He does set targets and you look at those - 1,000 goals and play with his son - does he do those and think 'right, I've done it all now?' I don't know where you go after that. He's just a phenomenal person, player. What he’s done for the game, it’s unbelievable.\"",
      "Ronaldo has spoken publicly about his dream to share the pitch with his eldest son, Cristianinho.",
      "\"I would like it, I would like it,\" he said. \"It's not something that keeps me up at night, but I would like it. We'll see. It's more in his hands than in mine. Let’s see if he has the hunger. The hunger is the most difficult.\"",

      "Bellingham, younger brother of England and Real Madrid superstar Jude, was a key part of Sunderland's promotion to the Premier League last season but elected to leave the Stadium of Light in the summer to join German giants Borussia Dortmund. He was hailed as one of BVB's marquee signings when he joined in a £25million deal in July.",
      "But where his elder brother thrived from the off at the Westfalenstadion, the younger Bellingham had made just two league starts before Saturday night's meeting with Koln, failed to score in his 11 appearances in total and has struggled to settle. Making matters worse are the growing tensions off the pitch between Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl and Bellingham's father, Mark.",
      "The pair clashed on the opening day of the Bundesliga season when Bellingham senior, a former non-league striker and retired police sergeant, took exception to his son being substituted at half-time by head coach Niko Kovac. The decision infuriated Mark, who waited in the tunnel after the final whistle to confront members of the club's hierarchy.",
      "The incident led to England World Cup legend Geoff Hurst labelling Bellingham senior a 'disgrace'.",
      "Speaking at an event in Bristol, where he admitted Jude is one of the two England stars he most admires - alongside current captain Harry Kane - Hurst said: \"A thing that has irritated me is a picture in one of the papers about the most powerful man in English football - and it's Jude Bellingham's father. He was complaining when his son was taken off in a game - and that is an absolute joke. If you don't eradicate that kind of thing, that is an absolute disgrace.\"",

      "But with United boss Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his midfield options they are looking for and wide for potential new options, with Atletico Madrid's Conor Gallagher also under consideration.",

      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after - there's still a big job to to in the next month. But I felt it was a month of reckoning: if it had started badly last week against Liverpool it could have gone a different way but it feels very different, it feels like the momentum is with them a little bit and the spirit is good.\"",

      "Manchester United secured a 4-2 win over Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday evening. Ruben Amorim celebrated his third consecutive victory following a monumental win against Liverpool at Anfield last weekend, this time defeating the Seagulls.",
      "United's goals were netted by Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo, before Danny Welbeck scored from a free-kick, giving Brighton a glimmer of hope.",
      "Despite Charalampos Kostoulas scoring late in the game, Mbeumo's second goal sealed the deal for United. Here are our player ratings for United's performance at Old Trafford...",
      "Since his debut against Sunderland, he has been a refreshing addition to the team. He made several crucial saves, including one denying Yankuba Minteh when United were two goals ahead, but he should have saved Welbeck's free-kick.",
      "He was brought back into the team due to Harry Maguire's absence through injury. Despite some shaky moments in the first half, he managed to deliver a solid performance.",
      "Possibly having the best season of his career, he has been exceptional this season, with the crowd erupting in cheers after a robust tackle in the second half.",
      "Substituted in the 64th minute due to an injury, United fans will be hoping it's nothing serious as Shaw has shown great resilience after a disappointing performance in the Manchester derby.",
      "After an impressive performance against Liverpool, he continued to shine on the right flank. He was denied a penalty in the first half.",
      "Scored through a heavily deflected effort. The 33-year-old disrupted play, made some crucial interceptions and looked impressive once again.",
      "Marked his 300th appearance for the club with a masterful turn just before half-time and set the pace from the middle of the pitch. Provided quality in the final 10 minutes when Brighton attempted to claw their way back into the match.",
      "Didn't contribute much offensively but was solid when required to defend. Dalot's preferred position is on the right, so he deserves praise for performing well on the opposite side in the past week.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha were the standout players on the pitch. He has hit the ground running since his move from Brentford and deserved his brace.",
      "Had opportunities to score but fell just short. The Slovenian is beginning to find his rhythm at Old Trafford, and grabbed an assist for Mbeumo.",
      "His first goal since his summer transfer from Wolves was worth the wait. He was outstanding in the closing stages at Anfield and reiterated his importance with a stellar performance.",

Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "Bruno Fernandes put his dreams before dosh when deciding to turn down offers from Saudi Arabia. And it's safe to assume those aspirations stretch past winning three league games on the spin for Manchester United, or being in the top half of the table.",
      "Or having to spend months on end without European football of some description. Let alone the Champions League variety. So a place in the sun, lining up alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, will have been appealing.",
      "But all of the above is what Fernandes chose ahead of some serious Saudi dollars in the summer. And no-one should be more grateful to him for doing so than Ruben Amorim.",
      "Fernandes could have been forgiven for looking around him at the wreckage last season left behind at Old Trafford, and deciding he'd had enough. In recent times, Fernandes has run his blood to water on behalf of United. And got no reward for it whatsoever.",
      "The 31-year-old has given his prime years to United, scoring 100 goals and contributing 84 assists. He's been voted 'Player of the Year' four times out of five.",
      "And believe it or not, things could have been much worse for Amorim, had Fernandes not been around. United might have struggled to raise a pulse under Amorim, but Fernandes has still been the heartbeat of the team.",
      "And it took the Portuguese less than two minutes to remind people of the fact at Old Trafford on Saturday night. When he ghosted into space and met a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, but sent his header wide.",
      "Moments later he was free again and set to pounce, had Matheus Cunha crossed to him, instead of attempting to score from an impossible angle. Fernandes was running the show again. Directing the traffic. Putting colleagues like Amad Diallo and Mbeumo into threatening positions with intelligent passes.",
      "And on his 300th appearance for United, looking determined to celebrate the landmark occasion in style.",
      "Chirping in the ear of referee Anthony Taylor, and those of his team-mates. Not least when Taylor decided to miss the most blatant penalty possible, when Maxim De Cuyper tripped Amad inside the box.",
      "Forget Fernandes being too good to grace the Saudi Pro-League, because at times he looks too good to be stuck in this United side.",
      "When United were considering signing Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon back in 2019, the club's head of recruitment showed a video in a meeting of the midfielder kicking down the dressing room door back in Lisbon, having been sent off in a game against Boavista.",
      "CEO at the time, Ed Woodward, 'loved' the passion of the incident. He thought it was what United needed, and was proved right because Fernandes was one of the best signings he ever made during his time running the club. That passion was on show when he ran over to Cunha to smack his chest in celebration at the Brazilian's opening goal.",
      "Representing United still means a lot to him. Something which can't be said of others to have pulled on the famous red shirt in recent times. But there is no escaping the fact Fernandes remains in danger of being unfulfilled at Old Trafford.",
      "He's spent almost six years there, and has just two domestic cups to his name. He's never had a sniff of winning a Premier League title, or the Champions League. Which is nowhere near good enough for someone of his abilities.",
      "And it's difficult to see this changing.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Fernandes insists he won't discuss a new deal at United until after next summer's World Cup. But United bosses shouldn't give him a choice in the matter.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who watched this win over Brighton, shouldn't be waiting that long.",
      "Just give Fernandes what he wants. He deserves that much.",
      "Because the Saudis won't go away, while United's slim chances of winning something big will be reduced to zero, without Fernandes pushing the buttons.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' release clause could scupper the Portugal star's dreams of playing in Brazil. At the very least, any club from the South American country looking to meet the asking price would need to more than double their transfer record.",
      "Fernandes opted to stay at Old Trafford despite summer interest from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal, but he will reportedly be allowed to leave for a team outside the Premier League if they are prepared to pay a little under £57million. The current record for Brazil's Serie A is the £22.3m Palmeiras paid Barcelona for Vitor Roque earlier this year.",
      "The Portugal international indicated to journalists this week that he is happy at Old Trafford for now, while hinting he could assess his options once more after the 2026 World Cup. \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change,\" he said.",
      "He also pointed to Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay, adding: \"I always said that if the club was like 'Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project', or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "It was back in May that Fernandes spoke about a desire to potentially play in Brazil. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part. I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting.",
      "\"The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "Even if a team meets Fernandes' clause next summer, there's no guarantee it will lead to a move. He has continued to play a big part under Amorim, albeit often in a deeper role than the one he often occupied last season.",
      "Much can change between now and May, with United chasing a return to European football after last season's lowly finish. They entered this weekend just two points off the Champions League places, but a congested top half means there's still plenty to play for.",

And though Brighton rallied late, that shouldn't take the gloss off of another big result for United and Amorim, who finally won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time last weekend.",

      "Thankfully for the Red Devils, their decision to spend big-money on Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looks better by the week. Mbeumo has been electric and showed flashes of brilliance again here before his two goals. Both he and Benjamin Sesko were already off the mark and Cunha joined them with a fine finish to set United on their way.",
      "As Gary Neville said on commentary, it's too early to pass judgement on Sesko given he's adapting to a new league, although there are encouraging signs and the three of them did look good together after the Slovenia star was benched against Liverpool.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha, however, arrived at Old Trafford with Premier League pedigree - and right now they are living up to their top billing.",
      "After months of speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Carlos Baleba did step out at the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday evening, albeit in a Brighton shirt.",
      "Unfortunately for the Seagulls midfielder, he was on the losing side and once again looked a shell of the player who dazzled last season, with the much maligned Casemiro helped United win the midfield battle.",
      "It remains to be seen if United will rekindle their interest in Baleba, who was taken off just before the hour mark.",
      "Manchester United have looked so much better with Senne Lammens in goal but we was unable to prevent Danny Welbeck from bagging a superb consolation for Brighton.",
      "The United academy graduate is now 34 but continues to shine at the top level - so much so that he was even considered as an unlikely transfer target for his former club back in the summer.",
      "Unfortunately for he and Brighton, his super strike counted for nothing in the end.",
      "The nerves were palpable around Old Trafford when seven minutes of second half stoppage were added, which indicates here's still a long way to go before we can say for certain that United have turned a corner. But recent performances, which have matched the upturn in results, show things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Amorim deserves tremendous credit for shifting the momentum at United with the huge levels of scrutiny on him. There may still be some question marks hanging over the United boss, but with more results like this, they will soon become a thing of the past.",

      "Greenwood became Marseille's first player since Jean-Pierre Papin in 1991 to score four goals in a single league game. And his performance did not go unnoticed overseas, with Barcelona scouts taking in the former England striker's four-goal salvo.",
      "The 24-year-old has starred for Les Phoceens since his £26.6million move from Old Trafford and has scored seven goals and made four assists in 11 outings this term. As per The Sun, Greenwood's performances have left Barcelona weighing up a future transfer - and that could be huge news for Manchester United, who are understood to be entitled to 50 per cent of any sell-on fee.",
      "Like Greenwood, Rashford has found success away from Old Trafford. The England international could see his Barcelona loan made permanent at the end of the season and certainly hopes that will be the case.",

      "The pair played together 85 times at United and combined for eight goals in that spell. They would hope to be more prolific at Camp Nou.",
      "While Greenwood has impressed in France following a stint on loan with Getafe, Roberto De Zerbi still expects more from his forward. He reiterated that after watching Greenwood's remarkable scoring feats, though he did also send some praise the forward's way. De Zerbi said: \"It's true that Mason can do more. Not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn't need to do better.",
      "\"He's already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "\"He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it's necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he's always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.\"",
      "Greenwood has regularly been linked with Barcelona, even when he was still with United. The La Liga giants monitored the forward after he showed promise in Spain as he scored 10 goals and made six assists for Getafe.",

      "Former Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho scored his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland on Saturday - and replicated a United celebration which reminded his former club just how much has changed in the last 20 months.",
      "The Argentina star left for Stamford Bridge in a £40million summer move and he isn't the only former starter forced out under Ruben Amorim. After finding the net against the Black Cats, Garnacho celebrated by sitting on the advertising hoarding, with team-mate Pedro Neto joining him. It brought to mind a near-identical celebration during United's victory over West Ham in February 2024, with Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund also involved, in a move which some read as mocking former Hammers star Mohammed Kudus.",
      "At the time, the trio were hailed as the future of United, with Hojlund scoring once and Garnacho twice in the 3-0 win. A defeat at West Ham nearly nine months later saw manager Erik ten Hag sacked, though, and his successor Amorim hasn't viewed the trio in the same way.",
      "Garnacho has completed a permanent exit, while Hojlund is expected to do the same after an initial loan switch to Napoli. Mainoo is still a United player, but has yet to start a league game this season.",
      "It shows just how quickly things can change in football. Not only have the three United players all found themselves in different cities, but Ten Hag has lost not one but two jobs, with his Bayer Leverkusen tenure lasting just 60 days.",
      "Garnacho's United exit was all but sealed by his reaction to being dropped for the Europa League final. The winger publicly criticised Amorim for the selection decision, despite coming off the bench as the Red Devils chased an equaliser in vain.",
      "“Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today - I don’t know,\" he said. \"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "Garnacho was left in United's 'bomb squad' over the summer, missing out on pre-season action as Amorim prepared to offload him and several team-mates. Speaking after Chelsea's Champions League victory over Benfica, though, the player insisted there are no hard feelings as far as his old employers are concerned.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told that playing Bruno Fernandes as a central midfielder in his current system will come back to bite him eventually. Manchester United are on a two-match winning streak ahead of Saturday’s match against Brighton, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen thinks they are threading on thin ice.",
      "United have beaten Sunderland and Liverpool to spark some renewed optimism around the club following a poor start to the campaign. Amorim has stuck by his tried and tested 3-4-3 formation, despite much criticism from pundits and fans alike.",
      "Club captain Fernandes has been fielded in a midfield two alongside Casemiro in the 2-0 win over Sunderland the 2-1 victory at Anfield. He has shown plenty of desire to get around the pitch, but the Portuguese is an attack-minded player and Meulensteen is concerned that his lack of defensive discipline will cause problems.",
      "“The system isn't the problem. It's the execution of the system because every system has its pros and cons. If you opt for a 3-4-3 formation, you expect certain qualities. You need to create chances and score goals,” Sir Alex Ferguson’s former assistant told CasinoHawks.",
      "“To do that, you need possession, penetration, movement, and all the elements that come with it. You need crosses in the box and numbers in the box. Bruno has been dropped a little deeper, but he lacks defensive discipline, and that will still be exposed. That will still be exposed by other teams, maybe by a different system.",
      "“So, we can discuss it, but we'll come back to the same conclusion. Only when United go on a run of seven to eight wins in a row can you probably start to see that the players have clicked into the system.",
      "“Plenty of other teams play the same system and do it really, really well. No problem at all. But it would be a bit premature for me to say that just because they beat Liverpool.",
      "“Again, Liverpool missed so many chances to basically get a draw. If it were a draw, everyone would have said, ‘Okay, fair result. United defended well, but they didn't create much in the second half, or what they did create, they didn't put it in the back of the net.’ So, I would be a little bit reserved on that one.”",
      "Fernandes has been happy to do what is being asked of him by his manager, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha up front, supported by Mason Mount. The 31-year-old will make his 300th appearance for United on Saturday and Amorim has summed him up in the build-up to the game.",

      "\"He suffers a lot with the losses. Every time we don't win a game, you can feel it. He takes it personally, as he should as a captain. He is a great leader, a great footballer, so let's see if he's going to reach that mark tomorrow.\"",

      "Brighton received interest from United in the Cameroon international, but the move didn’t gather pace, with their sky-high asking price successfully deterring rivals from pursuing him. They quoted a price north of £100million, with the £115m they landed from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo setting the bar high.",

Zidane was linked with the United job ahead of the Red Devils appointing Ruben Amorim last year, and he has once again been the subject of speculation this season.",
      "United have continued to falter under Amorim, but the Portuguese coach will hope that last weekend’s win over Liverpool can prove to be a turning point. Meanwhile, Zidane remains available and has previously addressed the idea of becoming United boss in the past.",
      "In 2022, when asked if he would consider taking a Premier League job, Zidane told L'Equipe: \"Never say never. Especially when you are a coach today. If I go back to a club, it is to win. I say this with all modesty.",
      "\"That's why I can't just go anywhere. For other reasons, too. Certain conditions make things more difficult. When someone says to me, 'Do you want to go to Manchester [United]?' I understand English but I don't fully master it.",

My feeling is that I want to be able to coach the national team in the future, even though I don’t mean right now. I would like to one day, but we’ll see.”",

Speaking to Gary Neville as part of a Salford City documentary series, Beckham addressed Phil’s time in Florida. He said ruefully: “Phil played five at the back in Miami, for six months.”",
      "A laughing Neville asked: “Did he play one up or two up? Beckham replied, rubbing his forehead: “One up! Five at the back and one up.”",
      "Neville then probed: “Did you tell him?” Beckham said: “Yeah, every day. We didn’t really have the philosophy of not telling the coach.”",
      "Beckham has said sacking Phil was one of the hardest things he’s had to do. Speaking to another former United colleague, Rio Ferdinand, he confessed: “Phil has been in management for a long time, and he knows what happens in management.",
      "“When I first bought in Phil to manage the team in Miami, I knew what he was going to do. I knew he was going to steady the ship. I knew that he was going to bring the work ethic that I’d seen over the years.",
      "“Everything had to be perfect with Phil. He brought everyone together and he changed that club overnight. The work that Phil did, it was incredible.",
      "“But Phil knew and he said, ‘If I’m not getting the results, I know what’s going to happen.’ And we’re close enough to have that conversation.",
      "“When he first came in, I said, ‘Phil, I don’t want this to affect our friendship.’ He said, ‘I get it, it won’t, when the time’s right, if it’s right, we’ll both know.’ And we had a very sensible conversation but I will never underestimate what he did for the club.",
      "“I think it was one of the most difficult things I’d had to do, even though me and Phil had spoke about it when he first came. I knew that if it came to this moment, it was going to be difficult, no matter what time it happened and when it happened.”",
      "Beckham remains involved with Inter Miami as a co-owner. Along with Gary Neville, he is also part of the main ownership group at League Two Salford.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson reckons Arne Slot has dropped a clanger by moaning about how rival teams approach matches against the Reds, essentially exposing their own vulnerabilities. Following the win over Man United, the Dutch boss took a swipe at Ruben Amorim's tactics in the 2-1 reverse against United, criticising their defensive setup and reliance on long balls in the air.",
      "Slot clarified his comments this week, insisting his remarks were intended as praise for the opposition's clever approach against the defending champions. He would revisit that tactical element following the Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Slot acknowledged his squad had improved when handling crosses into the penalty area. He said: \"That is a big, big, big difference and you go in at half-time at 1-1 with still the same amount of chances, but people will judge us differently if you don't score them.\"",
      "\"The biggest exception for me compared to the other games we've played was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them, which in the last four or five games we played we were not able to press the opponent because the ball wasn't on the ground, it was in the air.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson reckons Slot's observations about tactical approaches should have remained behind closed doors.",
      "Speaking to aceodds.com, Johnson said: \"Every team has their own style and you play with what you've got. Everyone wants to play football, in terms of what we call tiki-taka, which is great.",
      "\"But if you're susceptible against long balls, people are going to see that and try to exploit it. These days, everyone's got their own styles, the game's changing really quick.",
      "\"People need to do whatever they can to get an advantage on their opponents and if they think going long and attacking certain players and certain areas helps, teams are going to do that.",
      "\"Usually the managers take the bullet and protect their players, but at the same time, managers will also do what they think will get the best reaction out of their players. So if that means pointing the finger at them every now and then, if he's right, then it's okay.",
      "\"Of course you still need to make sure it's a happy camp and make sure it's constructive what you're actually trying to do rather than dissecting yourself from the team.",
      "\"I'm sure he's doing what he thinks is right, but in my experience it's always better to have those battles inside the camp and keep it in the dressing room.\"",
      "Liverpool are off to Brentford later today, hoping to halt their streak of three consecutive Premier League losses and close the gap on top-placed Arsenal. The Gunners face Crystal Palace at home tomorrow afternoon.",

      "David Beckham has revealed a surprise financial boost amid suggestions he could front a Manchester United takeover. Since Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stirred the pot by suggesting new investment was imminent at Old Trafford, other reports have suggested an unnamed consortium from the UAE is gearing up to make an offer for the Glazers’ shareholding in the club.",
      "It is claimed the group wants Beckham, who boasts a net worth of around £300million, to be involved in the bid, although as an ambassador rather than a benefactor. Beckham's earnings have soared since he retired from playing, thanks to various commercial deals and savvy investments.",
      "He is also a part-owner of MLS side Inter Miami and League Two club Salford City, whose primary ownership group includes his best mate, Gary Neville. During a recent visit to Salford, Beckham revealed to Neville a financial boost he had recently uncovered.",
      "Speaking to Neville as they toured the city as part of a club documentary series, Beckham said: “Do you remember our pensions? I forgot I had a pension.\"",
      "Neville then quipped: \"That’s when you know you’ve got a lot of money, when you forget you’ve got a pension!\" Beckham went on: \"I found my pension, it’s gone up quite a lot.\"",
      "Neville, now a successful businessman, then recalled a pension-related blow he once suffered. He said: \"My PFA pension, there was a maximum cap you could put in. Do you remember that? I got to the cap and moved my pension money into another pension so I could buy commercial property. Lost everything.\"",
      "As Beckham chuckled, Neville laughed: \"It’s not funny!\" When Neville was asked if he had always been a good businessman, Beckham interjected: \"Obviously not!\"",
      "Neville added: \"That’s probably the one big mistake that I’ve made. But your pension should be the safest thing in the world.\"",
      "Beckham’s pension pot discovery is unlikely to make a dent in any United takeover bid, with the Glazers believed to want in the region of £5billion for the club. The unpopular American owners have taken a backseat since Sir Radcliffe’s Ineos Group bought a 27.7 per cent stake and assumed control of football operations.",
      "But the team hasn’t moved forward under Ratcliffe’s watch, while controversial mass cuts have been made off the pitch, leading to frustrated United fans demanding a change of direction.",
      "But despite Al-Sheikh’s eyebrow-raising declaration, club insiders have been left surprised by the recent takeover talk, while Radcliffe made no reference to fresh investment during a wide-ranging interview earlier this month.",

      "Manchester United's unsuccessful pursuit of Carlos Baleba continues to loom large as they prepare to face Brighton on Saturday. Despite their best efforts, the Red Devils were unable to secure a central midfielder during the transfer window, with Baleba being a key target throughout the summer.",
      "Brighton stood firm in their stance that the 21-year-old star was not for sale, even going so far as to slap a whopping £115million price tag on the Cameroon international - a fee they had previously received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "While United may have other targets in mind, their interest in Baleba has not completely waned. The player is contracted until 2028, but there is speculation that a move to Old Trafford could be on the cards in the near future with Baleba believed to be open to joining United, while Bryan Mbeumo is also rumoured to be helping out.",
      "The midfielder remains on United's radar heading into 2026. Club officials were also reportedly delighted to discover that the Brighton star was open to a move last summer, despite the absence of European football this season.",
      "Brighton supremo Tony Bloom brutally dismissed suggestions that United's pursuit of Carlos Baleba constituted a \"saga\" whatsoever.",
      "The Seagulls chief provided a glimpse into the discussions and insisted that United swiftly abandoned their interest once told that the midfielder was not for sale.",
      "In conversation with The Argus, he said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "\"So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "Sources indicate that Mbeumo has been acting as an unofficial recruiter while representing Cameroon on the international stage, reportedly attempting to persuade Baleba to link up with him at Old Trafford.",
      "Both players were representing Cameroon during the most recent international fixtures. According to the Sun, Mbeumo seized the chance to discuss Baleba's prospects with the youngster.",
      "The publication suggests that the United attacker has even adopted a 'big brother' role with the 21-year-old. Nevertheless, it is understood that any potential move is more probable next summer rather than during the forthcoming January transfer window.",
      "It could be argued that the collapse of his proposed transfer has impacted Baleba's form during the opening months of the campaign. Yet the young midfielder insists he has rediscovered his peak performance levels ahead of Brighton's showdown with United.",
      "Following the Seagulls' victory over Newcastle on Saturday, Baleba celebrated with a social media post. Alongside several images from the match, he wrote: \"Good team win and I'm feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "In a fascinating twist, United star Leny Yoro showed his approval by liking the post. Baleba endured a difficult beginning to the campaign, with Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler openly demanding better displays from the player.",
      "Speaking before the Magpies fixture, the Brighton manager insisted Baleba must focus on his duties whilst he remains at the club. \"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton,\" he said.",
      "\"No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.\"",
      "While United monitor the situation, they have received a stark warning that Chelsea might make their move for Baleba. Ex-Aston Villa forward Gabby Agbonlahor even posted on social media, fuelling speculation.",
      "He said: \"Imagine him [Carlos Baleba] at Chelsea, imagine a midfield of Baleba, Caicedo and Fernandez, oh my god.\" Chelsea boast an extensive track record of prising players away from the Seagulls, to put it mildly.",
      "Over the past few years, Joao Pedro, Robert Sanchez, Caicedo and Marc Cucurella have all swapped the Amex Stadium for west London.",
      "The Blues even managed to lure former manager Graham Potter away from the South Coast club, although it's best not to dwell on how that move panned out.",

      "Senne Lammens",

      "Matthijs de Ligt",

      "Luke Shaw",
      "Was brought off with a knock in the 64th minute. United fans will hope the injury is not too serious because Shaw has bounced back after a poor performance in the Manchester derby. 7",
      "Amad",
      "Was unplayable at times against Liverpool and looked sharp again down the right. Was denied a penalty in the first half. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Scored through a heavily deflected effort. The 33-year-old broke up play, made some important interceptions and looked good again. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His 300th appearance for the club. Made a genius turn on the stroke of half-time and set the tone from the centre of the pitch. Provided quality in the final 10 minutes when Brighton tried to get back into the contest. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Didn't contribute much going forward and was fine when he needed to defend. Dalot's best position is on the right, so he deserves credit for performing on the opposite side in the last week. 6",

      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Had chances to score but just came up short. The Slovenian is starting to find his feet at Old Trafford. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "His first goal since signing from Wolves in the summer was worth the wait. He was excellent in the closing stages at Anfield and outlined his importance again with a superb display. 8",

Liverpool had to be the turning point and United built on that performance against Brighton despite a nervy ending.",
      "The last time United won three league games in a row was in February 2024. Erik ten Hag was on the ropes shortly after that run, but Amorim has managed to get up from the canvas.",
      "Brighton had won six of their past seven league fixtures against United. The Seagulls were also trying to become the first Premier League club to win four in a row at Old Trafford. The unwanted records stacked up last season, but Brighton didn't leave Manchester with a slice of history this weekend.",
      "There was a rousing rendition of 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' before kick-off. \"We've seen it all, we've won the lot,\" echoed around the ground once the game kicked off. Amorim was quickly down on his haunches to scan from pitch level.",
      "United considered Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window, but Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million and had planned to keep him at the Amex Stadium for at least another season.",
      "Baleba has made an unconvincing start to the campaign. Fabian Hurzeler has suggested his form has dipped due to the noise around his future, but he started the midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox were present in the directors’ box. They have the power to sanction a move for Baleba, who would have seen the game as a transfer audition.",
      "Baleba's first notable involvement was a tame shot from the edge of the box in the first half. He dragged his shot wide, the Stretford End sarcastically cheered and Brighton's analysts shook their heads.",
      "Amorim was shaking his head shortly afterwards when Anthony Taylor failed to award a penalty when Amad was brought down to the ground. Amorim vented to the fourth official, which is not often seen.",
      "United used that refereeing decision to spur them on - and Cunha opened the scoring moments later. He finished brilliantly into the bottom right corner after a spell of sustained pressure and was mobbed by his teammates. The Brazilian's first goal since signing from Wolves was worth the wait.",
      "The atmosphere cranked up another notch following Cunha's goal and his international colleague, Casemiro, extended the advantage with a heavily deflected effort.",
      "United academy graduate Danny Welbeck will celebrate his 35th birthday next month, but he is not slowing down with age and returned to Old Trafford as one of the most in-form strikers in the country.",
      "Welbeck had scored four goals in his last three games, however, he came up against one of the most in-form defenders in the league. Matthijs de Ligt is enjoying a superb campaign and was solid again.",
      "There were huge cheers for De Ligt when he made an exceptional recovery challenge at the beginning of the second half. The matchgoing supporters are aware of his importance this season.",
      "There were even bigger cheers when Bryan Mbeumo scored his first. Mbeumo has been a brilliant addition and has needed no time to settle after signing from Brentford. The Cameroon international is a goal machine and netted again during added time to notch his fifth of the campaign.",
      "United's recruitment hit rate has been shocking in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but Mbeumo and Cunha had Premier League experience on their CV and are both players with United DNA.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made his 300th appearance for the club against Brighton and dictated play from the deeper role again. Fernandes wanted United to sign personalities in the summer - and they have. Amorim overhauled the attack in a single window, and the investment was worth every penny.",
      "United never make it easy for themselves, though. Amorim will not be pleased with Brighton's late surge, and their two late goals are a stark reminder that there is still plenty more work to do.",
      "But Amorim has finally put United on the right track.",

      "Mbeumo's second of the contest ensured United would make it three wins on the bounce, and the Cameroon international spoke about the win and his start to life at United after the game.",
      "\"I enjoy it a lot here,\" he said when asked about his first few months at the club. \"It hasn't been easy at the start, it's a new environment, new expectation, but with my link-up with my team, everything is going the right way.",
      "\"We all put a lot of work in training, that's the most important thing. What we do out there we try to repeat on the pitch. We are going to try to understand each other even better.\"",
      "Mbeumo was asked if he could pinpoint the difference at United over the last few weeks, having picked up three consecutive wins following a run of just two wins in seven games in all competitions.",
      "\"The work we put in, the effort, the togetherness is the key,\" he explained. \"We try to stick to the plan and try to play as best as possible.",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Matheus Cunha and Casemiro after Manchester United's win against Brighton.",
      "United had a three-goal lead against Brighton after goals from Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo, but they conceded twice in the closing stages to set up a nervy finish.",
      "Mbeumo wrapped up three points with a second goal in the 97th minute. Bruno Fernandes intelligently left a pass from Ayden Heaven and Mbeumo fired into the roof of the net to seal the victory.",
      "Amorim was asked about Cunha and said: \"I think everyone felt against Liverpool he feels more confident if the game is harder. He feels more comfortable and wants the responsibility.",
      "\"I really like the way he defends today. He was not jumping all the time. He was not jumping and returning to position without the right pace. Today he defends really well and when he has the ball I have no concerns. He was struggling about not scoring goals, he can try to hide.",
      "\"But I understand. He was really happy. But not just with Matheus, everyone understood really well how to beat a very good game.\"",
      "Amorim also praised Casemiro, saying: \"I think he gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer].",
      "\"But he fought and worked and now he is back in the national team. He is so important to us. He ran a lot, today he had to fight and press, and then return. I'm really pleased with him.",
      "\"And the other guys need to look at Casemiro. To understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work for me. If I think you are the best one to play a game, then you will.\"",
      "Amorim was asked how important the victory was and said: \"It was really important, also the performance, we had to play different games in different moments of the game.",
      "\"And I think the players understood really well what to do in every moment. We had to suffer a bit at the end, it wouldn’t be Manchester United without a bit of suffering, but we deserved the win against a very good team, a team that is hard to press against high, but we did really well.",
      "\"I think they [the players] are more confident, the best game we did this season was against Arsenal. But then when you are confident, you have a different spirit, that helps you to win games. That's what I'm feeling now. We're a little bit more free. Last week we are a bit more luck because of that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I have that feeling [that Brighton is a bigger win than Liverpool], I think it was a more complete performance. You can say whatever you want to say against Liverpool, but Liverpool did not deserve to win that game. Today we did everything. We had the ball and created chances.",
      "\"We defend high, we defend low and when it's more complete, it's not a statement, but I feel more complete as a manager. So today, I liked it more today than the last weekend.\"",
      "Amorim discussed his tactical approach, adding: \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression]. When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "The United boss also clarified Luke Shaw was substituted after suffering from a virus during the week. \"Luke is fine. He had the virus during the week. He struggled a little bit in the first half but he's fine,\" he said.",

      "Highlights and reaction below:",
      "It felt like Amorim had a mountain to climb after defeats to Grimsby Town and Manchester City, but wins bring positivity and Amorim has now overseen three on the bounce in the league. Liverpool had to be the turning point and United built on that performance against Brighton despite a nervy ending.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Has been a breath of fresh air since making his debut against Sunderland. He made a few important saves again, including a stop to deny Yankuba Minteh when the advantage was two goals, but he should have saved Welbeck's free-kick. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Was recalled to the team due to Harry Maguire being absent with a knock. Had a few shaky moments in the first half, but recovered to deliver a decent performance. 6",

      "Zirkzee scored just seven times in 49 games last season after moving from Bologna during the final months of Erik ten Hag's reign. But he has made just five appearances this term and wants out as he looks to keep his World Cup dreams alive. United boss Ruben Amorim has already decided he is not part of his long-term plans.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "Summer signings Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha have ensured Zirkzee has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford - despite Rasmus Hojlund's switch to Napoli - and Amorim also prefers Mason Mount, meaning, while not a like-for-like replacement, Zirkzee's chances of minutes are even more remote.",
      "Zirkzee wants to leave In January and, despite his struggles, is unlikely to be short of offers.",
      "Spanish side Sevilla are keeping tabs on Zirkzee's situation, and new boss Matías Almeyda is keen to offer him a lifeline. Almeyda is in the process of overhauling his squad, is desperate to add more firepower to his attacking options and believes Zirkzee is more suited to Spanish football.",
      "But Nuno is also keeping an eye on his situation as he looks to boost West Ham's ailing attack. They were beaten 2-1 at Leeds on Friday night and Nuno again went without a recognised striker in his line-up, with Niclas Füllkrug out injured.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been \"surprised\" by the impact Senne Lammens has made at Manchester United.",
      "Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the October international break and he built on that impressive display by delivering another strong performance against Liverpool.",
      "The 23-year-old's long goal kicks were hugely effective in both of those United wins. Lammens made an important save to deny Alexander Isak during the first half at Anfield and received plaudits after the game.",
      "Speaking at Carrington on Friday, Amorim was asked whether Lammens' impact had surprised him. \"I think a little bit because it's hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he's not a young kid but he's still young,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"He coped really well with the pressure, he's really composed, he's defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style. I'm a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.\"",
      "Amorim discussed the direct approach, adding: \"I think you can see [progress] if you watch all the games. That game was different. If you have to point at a team who can control games with the ball, it is City or against Arsenal at the end of the game. Every team has to adapt and we adapt.",
      "\"We struggled to have long possessions against Liverpool, but if you go to the Arsenal game, it was completely different. Sometimes it is the environment, which is the first part we miss.",
      "\"Some players who are in different positions, who can give us more direct play than playing with the ball. We want to play a different style. Our style is a different style but I’m really pleased for the adaptation of winning games. Sometimes we are struggling but we can manage some things to win games and that is really important. If you judge our eight games, you know clearly what game we want to play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen (against Brighton). I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"We are always talking about that [a turning point], but that connects with the other question about how we face competition. If you just think about that - that we are going to try to perform and put everything on the field - that is the most important thing.",

      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",

      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",

      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",

      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",

      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",

      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Sporting Lisbon came from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, with former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood hooked at half-time.",
      "Greenwood came into the clash on a high after scoring four goals against Le Havre at the weekend. The 24-year-old has seven strikes and four assists so far this season, but he was sacrificed by Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi after the Ligue 1 side went down to 10 men in Portugal.",
      "De Zerbi's call to go safety first in the game has not gone down well with French media. Some outlets believe the Italian somewhat stifled his team's chances of winning by hauling Greenwood off and opting for a negative set-up, with De Zerbi seemingly still unconvinced when it comes to the defensive side of his game.",
      "Igor Paixao had put Marseille into the lead in the 14th minute. However, after Emerson was sent off in added time of the first half for diving to win a penalty having been set up by Greenwood, De Zerbi changed tact.",
      "His call to forfeit firepower in favour of solidity backfired as Sporting grew into the tie. Goals from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos condemned Marseille to defeat.",
      "Prior to Greenwood's exit at half-time, French outlet L’Equipe offered reserved praise for his performance. They wrote: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The outlet also awarded Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his first-half contribution. They said: “Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, subtly perplexed by Greenwood's hooking considering the player's general consistency, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has been critical of Greenwood's work rate ever since the ex-United player made the switch to France in July 2024. The Italian took another chance to remind Greenwood of his defensive responsibilities following the defeat to Sporting CP.",
      "“Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.”",
      "He told Canal+: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a center forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's strong words echo those he made in March, when he claimed he expected more from his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",

      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",

      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "The Belgian commanded his area in the hostile atmosphere and did superbly when he was called into action in the first half to prevent Alexander Isak equalising. In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

      "The atmosphere around Manchester United's Carrington training ground this week should be joyous after the club's exploits on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the game with Liverpool, you could see that Ruben Amorim was a whole lot lighter after the victory over Sunderland prior to the international break. However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with midfielder after midfielder, making it increasingly unclear what type of player Ruben Amorim actually wants to sign.",
      "Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand is a player Man Utd have reportedly been tracking for some time, and his name has been thrown in the mix once again by Portuguese outlet Record (via Sport Witness).",
      "The report claims that Man Utd and Man City are both interested in signing Hjulmand, with a ‘January transfer battle’ on the cards.",
      "His form has unsurprisingly ‘caught the attention’ of the Manchester giants and they are ‘following him closely’ ahead of the winter window.",
      "Both clubs have links to Sporting through United boss Amorim and City’s director of football Hugo Viana, which means they both know the 26-year-old well — and that it’s a very easy transfer rumour to make up.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas said there was interest in the summer and that Hjulmand turned down offers to ‘triple his salary’, but the report claims that January could present him with ‘headaches’ as City and United ‘promise’ to move for the midfielder.",
      "Hjulmand will reportedly pick up a loyalty bonus if he stays at Sporting until the end of the season, and the Portuguese club are adamant they won’t negotiate below his €80m (£69.8m) release clause.",
      "On Friday, we covered a story from Fichajes linking Athletic Club’s Oihan Sancet, and another from talkSPORT linking six other midfielders with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Surprisingly, Hjulmand’s name wasn’t mentioned by the latter, which claimed Man Utd are open to signing two midfielders in 2026 — with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Chelsea’s Andrey Santos, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller all appreciated.",
      "Hjulmand, a long-time target, becomes the eighth player added to Amorim’s midfield shortlist.",
      "The quantity of midfield targets proves that Man Utd are serious about strengthening in that area — but the quality and variety is confusing.",
      "The fact that Man Utd are reportedly considering signing two midfielders is a caveat, but the different profiles being linked with the Red Devils either shows they don’t know what they want — or that those reporting are just guessing. Or both. Definitely both.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has the ability to drop deep and dictate the tempo, but he’s wasted in those areas. United need him further up the pitch because he’s the most reliable goalscorer and creator Amorim has in his squad.",
      "What he doesn’t have are the defensive capabilities. He’s nothing like a prime Casemiro — the kind Amorim wishes he had — and he’s not a Patrick Vieira type who bombs up and down the pitch, winning tackles and making interceptions.",
      "With Fernandes an undisputed starter in Amorim’s midfield two, it’s clear the Portuguese boss needs a much more industrious player alongside him. Literally, if Casemiro were five years younger…",
      "There will be no unearthing of hidden gems like United almost managed with Moises Caicedo. Unknown quantities like Baleba and Santos — or under-the-radar Premier League and Championship ballers like Anderson and Wharton — are now commanding fees in a completely different stratosphere to what their current clubs paid.",
      "Stiller and Santos are similar in that they can play as a No.6, 8, or 10, but their best role isn’t what United need to become more defensively stable and get the best out of Fernandes.",
      "Gallagher is similar, but everyone knows what you’ll get from him: energy. The guy has an unparalleled engine and is a manager’s dream. But is he someone with the ability to dictate tempo and provide the defensive output required for Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system? Probably not.",
      "Baleba, Wharton and Anderson are all Premier League-proven and the right profile for Man Utd. Brighton midfielder Baleba is the perfect signing for me, Clive.",
      "Hjulmand is similar but lacks Premier League experience. He might be the most attractive signing of all eight players, but there’s no way United should be paying £70m.",
      "And then Sancet barely deserves a mention. He’s an attacking midfielder — and the source is, well, sh**.",
      "We all know Baleba will be the guy United sign at the end of the season. He’s going to cost around £100m, though. And knowing Man Utd, they won’t hesitate to pay it."

      "Amorim masterminded a great plan to get the better of Liverpool as he went for a direct approach and Slot had no answer for it as his side suffered their fourth straight loss in all competitions.",
      "Slot did not take this too well as the Liverpool head coach made a petty comment about Man Utd’s style after his team’s damaging 2-1 defeat.",
      "Slot said: “It is always difficult to play against a team that defends in a low block and mainly plays the long ball.”",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Slot has since added that these comments were meant as a “compliment” rather than a dig. He added: “We faced a team that had their game plan very well in order.",
      "“There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment… so, they had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.”",
      "Now, Amorim has insisted that he doesn’t care “what Slot is saying” as only he should “evaluate” his team.",
      "“I don’t care what Slot is saying,” Amorim admitted to reporters.",

      "“I think a little bit because it’s hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he’s not a young kid but he’s still young,” Amorim responded when asked whether he has been taken aback by Lammens’ start at Man Utd.",
      "“He coped really well with the pressure, he’s really composed, he’s defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style.",

      "Manchester United welcome Brighton to Old Trafford on Saturday evening, chasing a third straight Premier League win and a sense of genuine momentum under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United’s 2-1 win at Anfield last weekend, sealed by Harry Maguire’s late header, was their best performance of the season and a sign that Amorim’s ideas are finally taking hold.",
      "That followed a solid 2-0 victory over Sunderland at home. For the first time in a long time, United may have a measure of control over their game.",
      "Brighton, though, have been their bogey side. The Seagulls have won six of the last seven league meetings, including three straight at Old Trafford.",
      "The Seagulls arrive with their usual energy and attacking intent, having won three of their last four league matches and seen Danny Welbeck rediscover his scoring touch.",
      "In some ways, this feels more like a measuring stick of where United are than a trip to Anfield did. They’ll be expected to get on the ball and be the aggressor.",
      "As much as Fabian Hürzeler’s team plays without fear, they’re a dangerous counter-attacking side. The Seagulls will be more than happy to challenge their hosts to break them down.",
      "Manchester United vs Brighton kicks off at 17:30 (UK) on Saturday, October 25, at Old Trafford.",
      "There will also be full match commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.",
      "Lisandro Martínez remains unavailable as he nears the end of his recovery from a long-term knee injury.",

      "This fixture has produced a few classics in recent years and this could prove to be just as entertaining.",
      "Brighton remain one of the league’s most dangerous attacking sides, but their defensive issues haven’t gone away.",
      "Just one clean sheet in 20 league matches tells its own story, and with United’s front three starting to click, it’s hard to see the visitors keeping them quiet for 90 minutes.",
      "Danny Welbeck’s recent form makes Brighton a threat, yet United’s home record and growing confidence could give them the edge.",
      "Despite that, we’re not ready to trust them just yet. Both teams to score is a solid bet but doesn’t offer the juiciest price.",
      "Look to the both teams to score and over 2.5 market, which is priced at 4/5.",
      "We can also look to exploit the form of Danny Welbeck. He’s bagged a goal or assist in each of the last three seasons against his former club. He’s 11/4 to score anytime."

      "“His desire to be a Barcelona player is there since January 2025. Almost one year ago, in the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco, Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and they completed the transfer on a loan deal with a €30 million buy option clause.",
      "“Now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions between goals and assists, doing very well also in the Champions League, can play as a striker, can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona.",
      "“As I’ve been telling you for weeks, the feeling internally at Barca is that Rashford really perfectly fits the structure they have on the tactical point of view at Barcelona. They’re very happy with all the relationships Rashford has with his teammates as well.”",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",

      "Playing with better players will go a long way to helping improve that aspect of his game, and Real Madrid is undoubtedly a step up from Juventus.",
      "Yildiz has been linked with a host of European clubs and Los Blancos boss Alonso rates him so highly that he’d be willing to sell Vinicius Junior or Rodrygo to sign him.",

      "READ: Who are the top scorers of 2025? Gyokeres up to third but miles behind top two",
      "Alonso confirmed his admiration of Yildiz ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League meeting between Madrid and the Old Lady, which the former won 1-0 at the Bernabeu.",
      "“[Juventus] have very good players, and Yildiz is one of them,” he said. “He’s had a fantastic development. I know him. He was at Bayern Munich when I was there. Seeing his progress makes me very happy.”",

      "Casemiro, meanwhile, is out of contract at the end of 2025/26 and not viewed as a long-term option in midfield. There is a club option to extend his deal for a further year, and even considering his resurgence under Amorim, that wouldn’t be a wise financial decision as the Brazilian earns around £300,000 a week.",
      "Amorim ‘values him highly’ but as everyone is aware, he is severely lacking the ‘pace and athleticism’ required.",
      "With that in mind, coupled with Fernandes and Casemiro’s uncertain futures, several midfielders are being linked with a transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Carlos Baleba – As we are all well aware, Man Utd really like Baleba. Unfortunately for them, Brighton have ‘ruled out’ a winter sale, per talkSPORT. He is the club’s top midfield target and should be one of the sagas of next summer.",
      "Elliot Anderson – Are we looking at the perfect Man Utd signing? Anderson has been outstanding in the Premier League this season, leading the division for passes completed (569), progressive passes (71) and ball recoveries (64). He also ranks third for fouls won (19). He covers the ground required to fit Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has the ability to be the link between defence and midfield, and midfield and attack. talkSPORT says no talks have taken place and Anderson is keen to stay at Nottingham Forest.

      "Conor Gallagher – Another name being relentlessly linked in recent weeks, Gallagher is another perfect fit for a system that requires energy and an all-round game in midfield.  The report adds that Man Utd tried to sign him on loan in the summer, but Atletico would only sanction a permanent sale. He would cost at least £35m and is ‘open to a return to England’.",

It would be fair to quickly disregard Sancet as a midfield target for two reasons: the source and the fact that he’s much more suited to playing behind the striker in Amorim’s front three.

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "Man Utd have still taken just 40 from 35 Premier League matches since Amorim became Red Devils boss but a 2-1 win over defending champions Liverpool marks a step in the right direction.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last season with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund – who scored just seven league goals between them – coming in for a lot of criticism.",
      "Hojlund was sent on loan to Napoli, who are likely to make it into a permanent deal next summer, while Zirkzee has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving at Man Utd in the transfer market.",

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",
      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",
      "“So I think now, as is quite widely reported, the interest in buying Manchester United comes predominantly from the UAE,” Jacobs said on the United Stand podcast.",
      "READ: Do Manchester United have the quality to offset ‘the new Ji-sung Park’?",
      "“The group haven’t made any offer to the Glazers. They haven’t even engaged in talks. So it can be simultaneously true that Manchester United are quite in the dark, and yet, there is a consortium out there that is building, and Turki Al-Sheikh tweet got everyone excited.",
      "“The word advanced was misleading. And although the consortium are maybe getting advanced in terms of where their money’s from and what it entails, it’s not advanced between a bidder, and Manchester United, in fact, quite the opposite.",
      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",
      "On the fabricated Beckham reports, he continued: “I have great respect for other journalists, so I’m not here to shout down anyone’s reporting.",
      "“You may recall when I first broke this on talks, but I said a series of ex-Manchester United legends have been approached.",
      "“But I have my doubts about David Beckham, because when Sheik Jassim approached David Beckham, and when Qatar 2022 approached David Beckham, he was willing to do stuff, but only after Qatar won, and only after, and he didn’t Sheikh Jassim won.",
      "“So I’d be surprised if David Beckham considered putting his name or his endorsement to any potential bidder for Manchester United until the point came where they were actually in the club, and then he may be open to some kind of involvement.",
      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",
      "Jacobs later pointed out that Ratcliffe “is not that fearful” about losing power as the takeover situation is “relatively quiet”.",
      "“I think the lines of communication are open enough that Ratcliffe, in agreeing to this sale, including the drag clause, is not that fearful that the Glazers are going to go in the next year or two, definitively in 100%,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“But let’s see if there’s a pathway to a strategic investor, or let’s see whether a consortium just blows the valuation of the Dragon claws out the water, in which case we may have to reconsider the position of all parties.",
      "“But right now, it’s relatively quiet on the takeover front, even though Turki Al-Sheikh got everybody very excited.”",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",

      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "A 38th player has been capped for England while at a foreign club despite having ‘just completely forgot about’ the national team after seven years out.",
      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",

      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",

That then means they don’t have to scramble around looking for a new goalkeeper in the transfer market like they had planned to do, and can focus elsewhere instead.”",

      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco, Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and they completed the transfer on a loan deal with a €30 million buy option clause.",
      "“Now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions between goals and assists, doing very well also in the Champions League, can play as a striker, can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona.",

He broke up play, launched counter attacks and completely shifted the momentum of the game with his tenacity. And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",

      "It's now four defeats on the spin and if the goals don't flow soon, pressure is going to mount. That will test the mental resilience of a squad whose recent seasons have delivered stability, rather than battling survival. This is a season that could easily evolve into a tension-ridden relegation fight rather than a comfortable mid-table campaign.Lewis Jones",

      "After an improving showing against Newcastle, this was a return to the error-strewn efforts prior to that. Baleba switches off out of possession and looks far too loose in it. He was strongly linked with a move in the summer and does not seem to have settled.",
      "\"It is for the experienced players to get around him, ground him, have a couple of honest conversations because he is going to be a world-class midfield player.\" Still only 21 years old, that is most likely true given the potential that Baleba had shown previously.",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (7), Shaw (6), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Heaven (7), Dorgu (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a). \n\n\nBrighton: Verbruggen (6), De Cuyper (6), Dunk (5), Van Hecke (5), Wieffer (6), Ayari (6), Baleba (5), Minteh (6), Rutter (6), Kadioglu (6), Welbeck (7).\n\n\nSubs: Watson (6), Milner (6), Gomez (6), Kostoulas (6), Tzimas (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 22:19, UK",
      "Gary Neville has declared this to be Ruben Amorim's best week in the job after Manchester United made it three wins in a row in the Premier League with a 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday and believes the template is there for a top-six finish.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
      "\"That's the big job over the next couple of weeks.\"",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",
