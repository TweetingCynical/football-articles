      "Amorim kept faith in his goalkeeper until another unconvincing performance in the Red Devils' limp 3-1 loss away to Brentford. When Sunderland made the visit to Old Trafford on Saturday, Lammens was named in the starting line-up.",
      "The 23-year-old repaid his faith with a performance that was more assured than any of Bayindir's displays this season. Post-match, Lammens was showered with praise from fans and his manager, so it'd be understandable if Bayindir felt dejected.",
      "Yet that seems far from the truth. On Instagram, the Turkey international responded to United's win by sharing the final score alongside a red heart emoji and flexed bicep emoji.",
      "Bayindir was also spotted embracing Lammens on the pitch at full-time. Amorim insisted before kick-off that his decision to change goalkeepers was purely about squad rotation.",
      "\"Everybody has to be ready to play,\" the Red Devils boss said. \"We need to win this game, every opponent is different, so we try to find the best characteristics to win every match.\"",
      "Reflecting on Lammens' debut, Amorim told BBC Sport: \"Senne did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us.\"",
      "Mason Mount, who netted United's first goal before Benjamin Sesko doubled their lead, also had words of praise for his new team-mate. \"He was solid, when we were under pressure, the option was Ben [Sesko] and we worked off that,\" Mount explained.",
      "\"Buzzing for him, everyone was around him today, it can be tough making your first start we want to be together and I felt that today so we keep moving forward.\"",
      "Lammens will now head home to Belgium after being named in his country's senior squad ahead of two World Cup qualifiers. The ex-Antwerp man will be hoping to feature against North Macedonia and Wales.",
      "When he returns, United make the journey to Anfield to face a Liverpool side on a three-game losing streak. The Red Devils then host Brighton, as Amorim bids to guide his team up the table.",

      "Barca president Joan Laporta is said to have been stunned his United counterparts were willing to agree such a low fee, before seeing how the England star even settled in Spain.",
      "A Barca source said: \"At the top of his game, Marcus Rashford is one of the best players in Europe. Barca have got themselves a genuine bargain. Marcus should be worth more than £60m in the current market.\"",

      "Manchester United and England defender Harry Maguire could be in line for a shock move to the Saudi Pro League. The veteran centre-back, who cost United £80million when they snapped him up from Leicester in 2019 - still a world record for a defender - is out of contract in June.",
      "And Maguire has become a target of Saudi sides Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq. He is free to open talks with clubs when January 1 hits and would be able to command huge wages if he decided to head to the Middle East and join the Pro-League.",
      "Maguire's contract had been up last summer, but United elected to trigger a 12-month extension in his deal. Now, the Red Devils aren't expected to offer fresh terms as they look to the future.",
      "Maguire will be 33 in March, and could be tempted to cash in on what would be the last lucrative move of his career, particularly with his England career winding down.",
      "He said of his contract situation in August: \"Last year, the clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there. There was no talking. It was just that they activated it, and it got extended. This year, obviously I'm up at the end of the year.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can't leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",
      "\"I'm sure over the next few months they'll sit down and we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend, or obviously the transfer window will open again in January.",
      "\"Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don't want to put it out there to everybody, but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"",
      "Maguire has won 64 caps for his country but has been left out of the current squad by Thomas Tuchel and faces an uphill battle to force his way back into the reckoning for next summer's World Cup.",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United squad stepped up to the plate, saving their manager from another uncomfortable post-match inquest and, potentially, even losing his job.",
      "Ahead of the match, Amorim confessed that if results didn't pick up, it would be impossible for him to continue, with this game being touted as a do-or-die situation for the beleaguered United boss. However, first-half goals from Mason Mount and £74million summer recruit Benjamin Sesko paved the way for a comfortable United victory, propelling them to eighth place in the Premier League standings.",
      "Amorim will now hope to see out the international break without the fear of receiving a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his services.",
      "This win was crucial for Amorim to alleviate the mounting pressure on him, amid rumours of players losing confidence in his tactics and the United board beginning to question his suitability. United are still a team under construction and have yet to secure consecutive league victories under Amorim, but this win – even against a lacklustre Sunderland side – has bought the head coach some time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the team that suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford a week ago, giving goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, while Altay Bayindir was relegated to the bench. The United boss had previously stated that the two would compete for the No. 1 spot, and Lammens' performance suggests that Bayindir will struggle to reclaim his position.",
      "Lammens dominated his area, earning a massive cheer in the first half when he confidently collected the ball, and made two impressive saves in each half to round off an excellent debut. Bayindir has struggled to impress early in the season, so it was a breath of fresh air to see some stability brought to the defence.",
      "Sunderland rocked up at Old Trafford following their best start to a top-flight season in 70 years, having racked up 11 points to kick off the game in sixth place in the league table.",
      "Given this context, Amorim and his squad anticipated a tough challenge from Regis Le Bris's team, but the newly-promoted side failed to deliver. United got off to a dream start, taking the lead after just eight minutes, with Bryan Mbeumo setting up Mason Mount, who controlled the ball with his left foot before clinically finishing with his right from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad nearly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, cutting in from the left into the penalty area, then firing a left-footed shot towards goal which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to deflect.",
      "Roefs had to be on his toes again a few minutes later to fend off a shot from Mbeumo, as United ramped up the pressure in pursuit of a second goal to give them a bit more breathing room. United captain Bruno Fernandes then saw a delightful chip tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts bombarded the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "The second goal arrived in the 31st minute, with Benjamin Sesko pouncing on a loose ball and slotting it into the net after Diogo Dalot's long throw-in was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele. It marked Sesko's second goal for United, following his strike in last weekend's defeat at Brentford, and was no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "Sunderland struggled to pose an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to thwart them, diving early to his left to save a low shot from Black Cats captain Granit Xhaka.",
      "United had a scare just before half-time when referee Stuart Attwell awarded a penalty following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. However, after a VAR review and a check on the pitchside monitor, Attwell reversed his decision.",
      "In the end, United's first-half performance was enough to secure the win, setting them up nicely for a massive test after the international break – a trip to reigning champions and fierce rivals Liverpool.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Here's how the Red Devils' players performed this afternoon:.",
      "Senne Lammens - 8",
      "The deadline day signing made an assured debut for United. He was confident when coming out for the ball and pulled off a superb save from Granit Xhaka, as well as another close to full time.",
      "It'll be tough to dislodge him.",
      "Leny Yoro - 7",
      "The Frenchman deserved his return to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two matches. He brings a better balance to United's back three.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 7",
      "He was constantly alert to danger and never found himself out of position while defending his goal. He played a crucial role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it.",
      "Luke Shaw - 7",
      "He retained his spot on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the interval, giving United greater control on the ball.",
      "Amad - 7",
      "He was a constant menace down the right flank. He tormented Sunderland's defence and was unlucky not to score in the first half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved.",
      "Casemiro - 7",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 7",
      "The United captain put in a spirited performance, covering an impressive amount of ground and nearly scoring with a sublime chip that was tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 7",
      "Despite the Brentford mishap, Dalot retained his spot and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko managed to bag United's second goal. His energy levels were commendable.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 7",
      "Mbeumo was a constant thorn in Sunderland's side, providing the assist for Mount's opening goal and consistently making dangerous runs behind the defence.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 7",
      "Sesko found the back of the net for the second consecutive game with a classic poacher's goal from close range in the first half. His aerial threat was utilised effectively by United throughout the match.",
      "Mason Mount - 8",
      "Returning to the starting line-up, Mount justified his selection by setting United on the path to victory with a brilliantly executed goal. He received a standing ovation when he was substituted.",
      "Subs:.",
      "Dorgu (for Dalot, 64) 6 - Solid performance at left wing-back.",
      "Cunha (for Mount, 64) 6 - Provided a lively attacking threat",
      "Mainoo (for Mbeumo, 76) 6 - Didn't have enough time to make an impact on the game.",
      "Ugarte (for Casemiro, 85) N/A - Came on late in the game.",
      "Maguire (for Yoro, 85). N/A - Helped secure the win.",

      "The Belgian joined Ruben Amorim's team from Royal Antwerp for an initial £18.2million on transfer deadline day. Altay Bayindir kept his place for the next three Premier League games, but after the Turkey international struggled in last weekend's 3-1 loss against Brentford, Amorim made a change.",
      "Lammens repaid his faith with an assured performance, making a diving save to deny Granit Xhaka a goal from distance in the first half before denying Chemsdine Talbi with his legs late on. Responding to the 23-year-old's stop, the Stretford End chanted: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\", referencing their legendary former goalkeeper, Peter.",
      "Amorim will be delighted with Lammens' performance and the result, which eases pressure on his position during the forthcoming international break. It was billed as a must-win game for the Red Devils boss, with speculation that United were looking at options to replace him after a wretched 11 months in charge and woeful start to the new season.",
      "Ahead of Sunderland's visit, his side had lost four of their opening seven games. First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the perfect tonic, as was a Sunderland penalty which was overturned following a VAR review.",
      "\"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after giving the perfect reply to his doubters. \"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance.",

      "Things finally clicked into gear for Manchester United on a pivotal afternoon for Ruben Amorim, who will be able to enjoy some respite during the international break following a comfortable 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "The pressure and scrutiny has grown on Amorim in recent weeks due to United's poor form and it was imperative United signed off for the international break with a positive result. Step forward Mason Mount, who gave United the perfect platform to do just that with a crisp finish in the eighth minute after he was picked out expertly by Bryan Mbeumo in the penalty area.",
      "The hosts kept pushing with Robin Roefs in the away goal keeping the score down, thwarting Amad, Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes. But he was helpless on the half hour mark when Benjamin Sesko tucked home a first time finish in the six-yard box to give United some breathing space.",
      "It may only be the first weekend in October, but this game felt like must-win territory for Amorim and United. And for all the criticism that has been levelled at the Portuguese coach and his team in recent weeks, they delivered here.",
      "United were far more fluent and looked how you would expect Man United to look playing at home to Sunderland, with all due respect to the visitors. Amad was super effective getting forward at right wing-back and Bruno Fernandes, though playing in a deeper role again, was heavily involved in advanced positions and only denied a goal by an exceptional save from Roefs.",
      "On an afternoon where something had to give, United stepped up. They could - and maybe should - have got more goals, but this result could yet kickstart for their season.",
      "After weeks of talk over the goalkeeper situation, Amorim decided today was the day for Lammens, an £18.2million deadline day signing, to make his bow. And thankfully for United, their new man didn't disappoint on his maiden outing between the sticks.",
      "United are in desperate need of a strong figure in goal with neither Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana convincing during Amorim's tenure. Lammens was assured here and didn't put a foot wrong in difficult conditions.",
      "If Lammens is to be United's No 1 long-term, then he did his chances no harm with this display, which saw him keep the team's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "United spent £200million to address their goalscoring problem in the summer and there are now signs that the tide could be turning. Sesko, the club's marquee signing, has now scored in consecutive Premier League games, while Mbeumo grabbed the assist for United's first.",
      "Some of United's attacking play was slick. Mbeumo's fizzed pass into Mount was a thing of beauty and the former Chelsea midfielder's finish did it justice, while Sesko grew into the game and seems to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "It's still early days but United's new signings will be scrutinised when it comes to returns given the club's outlay. But as long as the goals and assists keep coming, like they did here for Sesko and Mbeumo, then there will be few grumbles.",
      "While all the talk before the game was of Lammens, it was Roefs who stole the show in the first half with a string of fine saves to keep the score down, particularly one world-class save to tip an effort from Fernandes onto the post in the first half.",
      "Sunderland have made a fine start to life back among England's elite but struggled to trouble a United side who finally showed some promise to ease the pressure on their beleaguered head coach.",
      "Make no mistake, today was huge for Amorim. Was his job on the line, as some have suggested? We'll never know given United have won, but it certainly felt must-win. And give credit where credit is due, he got his big calls right here.",
      "The decision to give Lammens the nod in goal was a shrewd one and United looked comfortable defensively. Much has been made of Amorim's 3-4-3 system - and his refusal to deviate from it - but key players such as Amad and Fernandes were effective here as United clinched a much-needed win. United's new-look attack recorded more returns, too, if you're looking for another positive.",
      "This will give him some welcome breathing space during the international break. But as positive as this afternoon was, it will count for little if United don't kick on after the break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Once again, the pace of the decision-making proved infuriating for players and fans alike, as Bruno Fernandes appeared to indicate that it was not a penalty before the official.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre confirmed the process. \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Sunderland.",
      "Referee announcement: “After review, there is no foul by the Manchester United player. He does not make contact with the head of the attacker. As the ball is out of play when the decision was made, the final decision is corner kick.”",
      "Dean said on Soccer Saturday: \"The issue I have, we have referees as VARs and assistant referees as assistant VARs.",
      "\"For some reason today, we've got an assistant referee as VAR and an assistant VAR. So they don't really know what's happened.",
      "\"For me, there's no contact whatsoever. He shouldn't have been sent to the screen, it should have been cleared on the field.\"",
      "It appears, Dean had been caught up in the confusion himself, and had not realised that Attwell's first decision needed to be overturned. The former-ref later clarified: \"The pictures me and Tim [Sherwood] were seeing, unfortunately, looked like it wasn’t given on field and was sent to VAR, I did a bit of digging at half-time and the referee actually gave the decision on field, so for me, he’s got that wrong.",
      "\"I had a bit of a go at Neil Davies, the VAR, saying he shouldn’t have got involved, but he was right to get involved as it was the wrong call by the referee. Neil got it right, sent him to the screen, it was overturned and the correct decision was made.\"",
      "The decision threatened to dampen what had been an exciting opening 45 minutes for Ruben Amorim's side. Mason Mount opened the scoring after just eight minutes as United started on the front foot against their in-form opposition.",
      "Sesko then doubled his side's advantage just after the half-hour mark as the Red Devils looked to get back to winning ways following defeat to Brentford seven days ago. United saw out the second period to earn a 2-0 win.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Jamie Redknapp has suggested that Manchester United target Andoni Iraola could manage 'any club in the world'. The Red Devils are pondering a managerial shake-up following their dismal start to the season.",
      "Current boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat, and a change could be imminent if United's dreadful form persists. A host of managers have been linked with the Old Trafford hot seat, including Bournemouth's Iraola.",
      "The Basque coach has made waves during his stint on the South Coast, with Friday night's victory over Fulham propelling the Cherries into the Champions League spots. Redknapp has been so taken aback by Iraola's performance that he believes he would be a boon to any club, including United.",
      "\"He's got so much quality, he improves players, he gives young players opportunities, the system is great, everything you do is very progressive, it's exciting, it's on the front foot.",
      "\"I would say he's one of the best managers in world football right now. They've just got to enjoy him while he's here. How long? Who knows... amazing manager at such a small club.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Steve Sidwell was in full agreement, stating that players would jump at the opportunity to play under the Spanish coach. He elaborated: \"He simplifies the game. As a footballer, when you go out onto the pitch, you just want two or three instructions, don't overcomplicate, I think that's what he does.",
      "\"If you look at the way Bournemouth play, high intensity, win the ball as high up the pitch as we can. They go direct; they know how to turn teams and play to their strengths.",
      "\"They've got the players around there that will do that. No egos, know their jobs, know their roles. It looks like everyone is enjoying themselves. I'd love to have played under him.\"",
      "Iraola took the reins at Bournemouth back in 2023 after previous manager Gary O'Neil was given his marching orders. In his first season, he guided the club to a respectable 12th place finish, improving to ninth in the subsequent campaign.",
      "The Cherries underwent a significant revamp in the summer, with key players such as Milos Kerkez, Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Dango Outtara all being shown the door during the transfer window. However, this hasn't slowed down Bournemouth's momentum, who have managed to secure four victories from their first seven league matches of the season.",
      "Last summer, Iraola put pen to paper on a new two-year contract with the club, although discussions regarding a contract extension are expected.",

      "Erik ten Hag is being touted for an emotional return to Ajax - just weeks after the former Manchester United manager was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen following their first two games of the new Bundesliga season.",
      "Ten Hag lasted less than four months overall with the former German champions, who selected the Dutchman as their successor to Xabi Alonso. He failed to win either of his two league games at the helm, though, before the club confirmed he was being relieved of his duties; a decision that Ten Hag later blasted as \"unprecedented\" in a strongly-worded statement.",
      "The 55-year-old has seen his reputation take a significant hint over the last 12 months, with his swift exit at Leverkusen following on from his sacking at Manchester United last October. But his struggles in the Premier League and Germany have seemingly not done his chances of a return to Ajax any harm, with De Telegraaf saying such a move could be a possibility come January.",
      "Ten Hag's former club are currently managed by John Heitinga, who has them third in the Eredivisie and has yet to lose in seven league games this term. But Ajax have lost both of their games in the Champions League against Inter Milan and Marseille and some fans are already calling for a change.",
      "While Ajax's top brass are currently reluctant to act, growing fan unrest, coupled with some underwhelming performances, could force their hand, with Ten Hag seemingly an option to step in.",
      "It's noted that Ten Hag would be open to managing Ajax again after leaving the club to join Manchester United almost three-and-a-half years ago. Intriguingly, he was heavily linked with a return to Amsterdam before taking up an offer from Leverkusen earlier this year as the club sought a new head coach.",
      "The club's technical director, Alex Kroes, confirmed there was interest in Ten Hag back in May, saying: \"Erik ten Hag has been on the list for a long time. He is well-known, he did a fantastic job when he was here.",
      "\"I spoke to him briefly on Sunday. He was in the Arena as a spectator,\"",
      "Ten Hag enjoyed a hugely successful four-year spell with Ajax before landing the Manchester United job, winning three league titles and two domestic cups. He also took the club deep into the Champions League in 2019, reaching the semi-finals before Ajax succumbed to Tottenham over two legs.",

      "United paid £18.2million to bring Lammens in from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer transfer window but the young Belgian keeper has yet to make an appearance for the Red Devils, with Bayindir featuring in all six of Manchester United's Premier League games so far this season.",
      "Neither Bayindir or last season's No 1, Andre Onana, have convinced in goal during Amorim's tenure, sparking calls for Lammens to be thrust straight into the team. And while Amorim initially resisted, Lammens gets the nod for a game which could have major ramifications for United's Portuguese head coach, who has seen the scrutiny grow on him in recent weeks.",
      "United have made a poor start to the new Premier League campaign, winning just two of their six games. Sunderland is viewed as a must-win fixture for the Red Devils, with some reports suggesting that Amorim could be sacked if United head into the international break off the back of another disappointing result.",
      "Amorim has won just 18 of the 49 matches he has overseen since arriving at Old Trafford last November and he even conceded himself that results need to improve if he is to remain in charge during his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Nobody here is naive,” the United boss said when asked about previous results.",
      "“We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it’s hard – the balance is really hard.”",
      "It had also been suggested recently that Amorim could resign if things do not improve. But the former Sporting Lisbon chief refuted such talk in his presser, adding: “No. That is a board decision. I cannot do that.",

Amorim's men head into Saturday's clash with Sunderland knowing full well that performances need to improve if they are to live up to Scholes' hopes at the start of the campaign.",

Beckham said: \"I very rarely panic but when Gary came to me and said 'OK, this is the situation, we need to find a way of saving the club', I was concerned.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo could return to face his former club Manchester United in a mid-season friendly. Reports emerged this week claiming the cash-strapped Red Devils are considering a winter trip to the Middle-East to make up the money they lost in failing to qualify for Europe, as well as their early Carabao Cup exit.",
      "Their lack of midweek fixtures means Ruben Amorim’s men certainly have scope to play more games than their Premier League rivals in a bid to increase revenue. The Portuguese admitted as much, recently saying: “We have to do it. We knew it when we missed Europe. We have our fans, we have the budget, we have to compensate a lot of things.”",
      "Friendlies in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, where Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr currently lead the table, have been reported as potential avenues. There has been no confirmation yet, however, with the Old Trafford club still holding early-stage talks with stakeholders and exploring potential dates, while the likes of AC Milan and Sevilla have also been mentioned as possible opponents.",
      "A lucrative fixture between United and Al-Nassr would be the first meeting between the 40-year-old and United since he left on bitter terms to join the Saudi Pro League outfit in 2022. Ronaldo famously fell out with then-United manager Erik ten Hag when he refused to come off the bench in United's 2-0 win against Tottenham.",
      "After years of speculation, Ronaldo finally got engaged to his long-term partner Georgina Rodriguez this summer. The Argentine-Spanish model and influencer announced the news on social media in August along with a picture of her enormous oval-cut diamond ring, writing \"Yes I do. In this and in all my lives\" in her native Spanish.",
      "The couple met in a Madrid Gucci store, where Georgina worked as a sales assistant, during the forward’s spell at Real Madrid, which they described as \"love at first sight\". Nine years later, they are planning their wedding day.",
      "Details of when we might expect the big day are still not clear. However, there are suggestions that it will likely come after July 19, 2026, which is when the World Cup ends.",
      "Ronaldo’s dream scenario would be to lift the trophy for the first time and immediately follow it up with his wedding day. The couple may decide to hold the ceremony in the football legend’s native Portugal, while the Daily Mail claims a potentially star-studded celebration could cost over £10million.",
      "As of this year, Ronaldo’s estimated net worth is believed to be somewhere in the region of £600m and £1billion. His contract with Al-Nassr alone made him the highest-paid player in the world, thought to be worth a staggering £219.5m-per-year.",
      "In June, the veteran landed a pay-rise to keep him at the club until the age of 42, with a staggering deal reportedly worth a minimum of £492m over two years. On top of that, he banked a £24.5m signing bonus, which will increase to £38m if he triggers the second year of his contract. He will also reportedly be given a stake in the club.",
      "Aside from his football earnings, Ronaldo’s enormous wealth has also come by way of several endorsements, most notably with Nike, with whom he has a lifetime agreement worth a guaranteed $1billion (£742m). He also has contracts with Armani, Tag Heuer, Kickoff, Herbalife, Livescore, Clear, Binance, PokerStars and Castrol.",
      "Ronaldo has proven himself a savvy entrepreneur with his own clothing brand, CR7, and hotel chain. He bought a £5.5m super-yacht in 2020, has a car collection worth tens of millions and a Global Express 6500 private jet said to be worth £61m.",
      "The eldest of Ronaldo’s five children, 15-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo Jr, is following his father’s footsteps as an aspiring professional footballer. The youngster played in Juventus and Manchester United’s academies during his dad’s respective stints at the clubs, and now plays in Al-Nassr’s youth set-up.",
      "He was born in the United States and was also able to represent Spain but decided to play for Portugal at youth level as a nod to his dad's legendary career. Cristiano Junior made his debut for Portugal's Under-15s against Japan in May and notched up his first two goals against Croatia just a few days later.",
      "Following his first appearance for Portugal Under-15s, Cristiano Senior shared his pride on social media. \"Congratulations on your debut by @selecaoportugal, son,\" Ronaldo wrote. \"Very proud of you!\"",

The Reds face Sunderland this weekend with the heat intensifying on Amorim, following a rocky start to the season marked by defeats to Arsenal and Manchester City, and last weekend's 3-1 loss at Brentford.",
      "In his pre-match press conference, Amorim firmly stated he had no intention of stepping down from his role at United, despite whispers suggesting he might quit before being sacked. Regardless of whether or not Amorim was considering walking away, the upcoming match against the Black Cats is undeniably crucial.",
      "Ahead of the game, journalist David Ornstein provided some insight into the mood within the United camp regarding Amorim and his squad. Speaking to NBC Sports, Ornstein revealed that the majority of players continue to back Amorim.",
      "However, there seems to be an understanding that if United were to concede in recent matches, they're 'not doing what they were told to do' under him. This defiance is thought to stem from a 'psychological or mental' issue within the team.",
      "Addressing the string of disappointing results, Amorim told reporters that he needed to confront the situation head-on. \"It's normal,\" he maintained when questioned about the mounting pressure.",
      "\"You cannot run away from the results and then you have the baggage from last season. It's going to be a really tough match (vs Sunderland).",
      "\"They are doing really well and when you see the games, they draw with one less player and then they win in the final play against Brentford. The details are changing a lot, so we need to pay attention to that.",
      "\"It's a team that plays really well, a clear system, 4-3-3, with a lot of rotations on the side of the pitch. They are confident.",
      "\"So it is clear we will be under pressure. We have had some moments.",
      "\"During these six games during this season, we are not always the same team in small things, more in the way we play. All the effort that we put in, we put in the maximum in every single thing.",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt has been axed from Ronald Koeman's Netherlands squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. De Ligt has been a mainstay in United's backline this campaign, featuring in all six of their Premier League outings.",
      "However, despite finding his feet again at Old Trafford in recent weeks, Koeman has dropped the towering centre-back from his squad for the upcoming international break. The snub comes just over a year after the United defender faced fierce criticism for his displays whilst on international duty.",
      "During the Netherlands' 2-2 draw with Germany in September's international break last year, De Ligt was culpable for both of the opposition's goals.",
      "Germany's opener saw De Ligt give away possession in his own territory, allowing Deniz Undav to level the scores, before his botched clearance enabled Joshua Kimmich to fire Germany ahead.",
      "The errors prompted Koeman to withdraw the defender at the interval, bringing on Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke in his place. Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk was amongst those to criticise De Ligt's poor showing, with the Reds captain condemning the defender's decision-making at the back.",
      "Van Dijk said at the time: \"This is football. You have to learn from this. It was one moment but at the highest level you will get punished for it.\"",
      "Koeman supported his Dutch skipper's words, admitting that while he would have preferred to leave De Ligt on the field, he felt compelled to substitute him.",
      "The Dutch manager said: \"Of course I would rather have kept Matthijs de Ligt on the pitch.",
      "\"It just looks like he is now in a period where all his mistakes are being punished. I gave him a new chance today, but eventually protected him by taking him off.\"",
      "Whilst De Ligt's displays for his country have come under fire, the defender will believe his performances have got better throughout the past year and he has enjoyed a decent start to the campaign for United.",
      "The 26-year-old won't get the chance to demonstrate his value to the Netherlands during this international window, however, and will instead stay to train at Carrington.",
      "This means De Ligt can concentrate on his club form after he called on the rest of the United squad to raise their game in support of struggling boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "After a crushing 3-1 loss to Brentford, the centre-back acknowledged that the team lacks belief and must perform better - but it's not entirely down to Amorim.",
      "He said: \"Of course, I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",

      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has given up hope and wants 'to be put out of his misery,' according to Chris Sutton. The United boss received sympathy for last week's defeat at Brentford, with Harry Maguire and Altay Bayindir being blamed for the defeat.",
      "The Reds are set to welcome red-hot Sunderland to Old Trafford in a crunch clash that could determine the struggling Portuguese coach's future.",
      "The position of Amorim as United's gaffer has been a hot topic of discussion in the run-up to the clash against the newly-promoted side. Following last weekend's loss to Brentford, rumours are rife that Amorim could be on his way out of Old Trafford in the coming weeks.",
      "Speculation is mounting that Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner, AFC Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler could be in the running for the United job if Amorim departs. With Sunderland next up for United this season, an ex-Premier League forward is backing the visitors to triumph over Amorim's squad.",
      "In his Premier League predictions for this weekend, Chris Sutton has revealed why he is backing Sunderland to pile more misery on United and Amorim. He also thinks Amorim is looking like a defeated man and accused two players of letting him down.",
      "\"I am not just backing them [Sunderland] for the sake of it, clearly,\" he told BBC Sport. They are extremely well organised and everything about them has been impressive. Manchester United, on the other hand, are still a mess.",
      "\"You can blame Ruben Amorim for that as much as you like but when your centre-half is running out and taking a chance on an offside on a long ball, like Harry Maguire did for Brentford's first goal last week, then that is just terrible defending. That's where I feel for Amorim.",
      "\"Altay Bayindir should also have done better with Brentford's second goal and the goalkeeping situation is perplexing too - they have brought Senne Lammens in, but where is he?",
      "\"It is just all muddled thinking at United and Amorim is starting to look like a guy who wants to be put out of his misery.",
      "\"They are just not improving under him, although he might actually get a result here off the back of me saying Sunderland will win.\"",
      "Were United to fall to defeat this afternoon, the pressure would be higher than ever before on Amorim. In his pre-match press conference, the Portuguese head coach insisted that he was not looking to resign from his position at the club.",

      "Speculation over Amorim's future has been bountiful following last weekend's 3-1 defeat to Brentford. United have proven unconvincing so far this season.",
      "The Red Devils have won just two of their opening seven matches across all competitions and sit 14th in the Premier League. They have recorded just seven points after also finishing 15th last term.",
      "Ahead of Sunderland's visit to the Theatre of Dreams, talk amounted over the risk to Amorim's position should United be defeated. The Black Cats have made a promising start since returning to the Premier League, winning three and drawing two of their six games.",

      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has bought the head coach more time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the side that lost 3-1 at Brentford a week earlier, handing goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, with Altay Bayindir demoted to the bench.",
      "The United boss had already declared the pair would fight it out for the No.1 spot and the way Lammens performed suggests it will be hard for Bayindir to win back his place.",
      "Lammens commanded his area, earned a huge first-half cheer when he came for the ball and confidently collected it, and produced two fine saves in either half to cap a solid first game. Bayindir has failed to convince in the early parts of the season and it was refreshing to see some stability brought to the backline.",
      "Sunderland arrived at Old Trafford on the back of their best start to a top-flight season for 70 years, having amassed 11 points to start the game in sixth position in the table.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim and his players expected Regis Le Bris's side to provide a stern test, but it was anything but that as their newly-promoted opponents failed to show up.",
      "United made the perfect start, taking the lead after eight minutes, Bryan Mbeumo picking out Mason Mount, who took the ball down with his left foot before producing a clinical finish with his right to score from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad came close to making it 2-0 in the 20th minute, cutting inside from the left and into the penalty area, then unleashing a goal-bound left-footed strike which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to turn away.",
      "Roefs had to be alert again a couple of minutes later to repel a shot from Mbeumo, as United stepped up a gear in search of a second goal to give them some more breathing space.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes saw a delightful chipped effort tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts laid siege to the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "But the second goal duly came in the 31st minute, Benjamin Sesko reacting quickest to turn the loose ball into the net after a long throw-in from Diogo Dalot was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele.",
      "It was Sesko's second goal for United, having scored in the defeat at Brentford last weekend, and no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "The visitors did not provide much in the way of an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to deny them, getting down early to his left to keep out a low shot from Black Cats skipper Granit Xhaka.",
      "United survived a penalty scare in first-half added time when referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. VAR checked the incident and after Attwell went to the pitchside monitor to review it, he reversed his original decision.",
      "Ultimately, United did enough in the first-half to secure the win ahead of a huge test after the international break – a trip to champions and arch rivals Liverpool.",

      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",

      "Read the full report here.",

      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",

      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",

      "Superb finish from Mount to give United the lead. Mount took down Mbeumo’s ball with a fine first touch with his left foot and then produced a clinical finish with his right to put the home side ahead. There was no emotion fron Amorim on the touchline, just a thumbs up to his coaching staff.",

      "Altay Bayindir was in good spirits following Manchester United's 2-0 victory over Sunderland - despite being dropped by Ruben Amorim. Bayindir, 27, had started United's previous six Premier League games, three of which came after Senne Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp in a transfer deal worth up to £21.6 million.",
      "The goalkeeper failed to convince Amorim that he was a reliable No.1 and last weekend's dismal 3-1 defeat away to Brentford proved to be the final straw. Ahead of Saturday's clash with Sunderland, Lammens was named in the starting XI for the first time.",
      "Not only did the 23-year-old keep a clean sheet, but he produced a performance vastly more assured than any of Bayindir's this season. Lammens earned praise from supporters and Amorim post-match, so you'd forgive Bayindir for feeling blue.",
      "But that doesn't appear to be the case. On Instagram, the Turkey international reacted to United's win by posting the scoreline, a red heart emoji and a strong arm emoji. Bayindir was also seen hugging Lammens on the pitch after the final whistle.",
      "Amorim said ahead of kick-off that his decision to drop Bayindir was simply down to rotating his squad. \"Everybody has to be ready to play,\" the United manager stressed. \"We need to win this game, every opponent is different, so we try to find the best characteristics to win every match.\"",
      "Reflecting on Lammens' debut, Amorim told BBC Sport: \"Senne did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us.\"",
      "Mason Mount, who scored United's first goal prior to Benjamin Sesko's strike to make it 2-0, also praised his new team-mate. \"He was solid, when we were under pressure, the option was Ben [Sesko] and we worked off that,\" Mount explained.",

      "Manchester United have been urged to stop trying to sign Frenkie de Jong as Òscar Garcia claimed he isn't \"decisive\" enough for the big games.",
      "The Red Devils have been after the Dutch midfielder's signature for quite some time after Erik ten Hag identified the midfielder as a key transfer target after joining in 2022. The former United boss was keen on reuniting with his ex-player after their time at Ajax and it was reported that Barcelona were prepared to sell the star.",
      "However, De Jong told NOS at the time that he wanted to stay, so the deal fell through. Three years on and the La Liga star's contract runs out in June 2026, so he could opt to depart either in January or on a free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "However, the ex-Barca youth coach has indirectly told the Old Trafford outfit to swerve the potential deal, claiming that while De Jong is good, he's not worth what he is being paid. Speaking on Cadena SER's “Què t'hi Jugues” broadcast during Oviedo and Barcelona game, Garcia said: \"I think he's better than you say and worse than what he's paid to do.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He's a good player, but he's not the typical footballer we've always had in that position in front of the defence. And he's not decisive enough to be one of the highest-paid. Normally, the highest paid are the ones who decide games.\"",
      "He added: \"Yes, he's a very good player, but I don't think he can decide a match.\"",
      "Currently, De Jong is one of the highest-paid players in the squad, second only to Robert Lewandowski in terms of fixed salary. SPORT reported that Barcelona president Joan Laporta wants to keep the midfielders contract the same and allow him to drop down in the salary figures in the future.",
      "While Garcia has been particularly critical of De Jong in the Barca side, the star has been seeing a resurgence in his form since the new season began.",
      "He has one assist in seven games, including two in the Champions League and performed exceptionally well against Newcastle United in their opening European match.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United will reignite their interest in the 28-year-old next January or if Ruben Amorim will have different plans for his midfield come the next transfer window.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Manchester United supporters sang the praises of new goalkeeper Senne Lammens following his victorious debut for the Reds. Lammens, 23, made his eagerly anticipated first appearance for United in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland at home.",
      "Lammens justified his manager's confidence with a composed display, producing a spectacular diving stop to thwart Granit Xhaka's long-range effort in the opening period before blocking Chemsdine Talbi's attempt with his legs in the closing stages.",
      "Following the 23-year-old's intervention, the Stretford End sang: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\", paying tribute to their iconic former goalkeeper, Peter.",
      "Amorim will be thrilled with Lammens' showing and the outcome, which relieves the burden on his role ahead of the upcoming international break.",
      "The fixture was portrayed as a crucial fixture for the Reds manager, amid reports that United were considering alternatives to replace him after a dismal 11 months at the helm and a dreadful beginning to the current campaign. Prior to Sunderland's arrival, his team had suffered defeat in four of their initial seven matches.",
      "Opening-half strikes from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko provided the ideal remedy, alongside a Sunderland spot-kick that was reversed after a VAR examination. \"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after giving the perfect reply to his doubters.",
      "\"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance. Senne did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today.",
      "\"We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us.",
      "Mount also spoke about Lammens' debut. He said: \"It's crucial in the Premier League keeping clean sheets, you have opportunities to score and then to maintain the clean sheet in the second half was so vital. He was solid, when we were under pressure, the option was Ben [Sesko] and we worked off that.",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways with a much-needed 2-0 win at home to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon.",
      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko eased the pressure on Reds boss Ruben Amorim after a week of intense scrutiny of his position at Old Trafford. Amorim's side were lacklustre in defeat at Brentford last weekend but enjoyed a positive day at M16 against the Black Cats.",
      "United will now have the international break to reflect on what has been a difficult start to the season after finishing 15th in the top-flight last term - the club's lowest-ever Premier League finish.",
      "But Amorim has almost certainly earned himself some breathing room ahead of United's next fixture - a clash at bitter rivals Liverpool on October 19.",
      "The Reds' win over Sunderland has moved them up to eighth in the table for now, and supporters will have been pleased to see a positive debut from new goalkeeper Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko also impressed in a good afternoon for United.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day.",
      "Ruben Amorim called on his Manchester United players to show they are fully behind him after the win over Sunderland.",
      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko secured a vital win for Amorim that eased the pressure on the United boss heading into the international break.",
      "Amorim said his players back him and do not want a new boss, but challenged them to show that by delivering every time they play.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have been urged to stop trying to sign Frenkie de Jong as Òscar Garcia claimed he isn't \"decisive\" enough for the big games.",
      "Speaking on Cadena SER's “Què t'hi Jugues” broadcast during Oviedo and Barcelona game, Garcia said: \"I think he's better than you say and worse than what he's paid to do.",
      "\"He's a good player, but he's not the typical footballer we've always had in that position in front of the defence. And he's not decisive enough to be one of the highest-paid. Normally, the highest paid are the ones who decide games.\"",
      "Manchester United supporters sang the praises of new goalkeeper Senne Lammens following his victorious debut for the Reds. Lammens, 23, made his eagerly anticipated first appearance for United in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland at home.",
      "Lammens justified his manager's confidence with a composed display, producing a spectacular diving stop to thwart Granit Xhaka's long-range effort in the opening period before blocking Chemsdine Talbi's attempt with his legs in the closing stages.",
      "Read more here",
      "On playing under pressure, Sesko added: \"I work for that, if you have pressure it means you are doing something good. I don't' take pressure as something negative.",
      "\"It's important for us to win, to get confidence for the next game, especially as we go into the break. When we come back we will be ready to go into the next game.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has reacted to scoring his first Manchester United goal at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I've dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable. Not just after the goal, but after every tackle as well. It's a dream come true, I'm happy we won,\" he said.",
      "\"There are some differences [between the Premier League and Bundesliga], the guys are stronger, but I'm getting use to it more and more every training, getting better every single game.\"",
      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United news after Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "That was much more like it from Ruben Amorim's side, who recorded a deserved win over the Black Cats. Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens will offer lots of encouragement to United fans who have a glimmer of hope now.",
      "It was only one game and United have seen plenty of false dawns before. Plus, Amorim will still face questions over his future if the Reds lose their next match - even though it's at Liverpool.",
      "But the Portuguese and his players deserve credit for a good win against an in-form Sunderland side. Follow our live blog throughout the day and evening for all the latest after today's win."

      "Manchester United take on Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium last weekend, which forced United sources to clarify Ruben Amorim still retains the backing of the board.",
      "Amorim is under increasing pressure and needs a positive result against Sunderland before the October international break. United have made an awful start to the season and Amorim's future has dominated headlines.",
      "Sunderland have made a superb start to the Premier League campaign following promotion from the Championship and will sense an opportunity to cause an upset at Old Trafford.",
      "Here are five things to look for:",
      "The Mainoo debate",
      "There has been widespread discussion about Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo this season. Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game and many fans believe the youngster has been underused.",
      "Mainoo came on from the bench against Brentford last weekend. He caught the eye immediately after replacing Manuel Ugarte, and it's surely time to start him against Sunderland.",
      "The midfield has continued to be a problem and Mainoo has the quality to provide control in the centre of the pitch. The youngster has knuckled down in an attempt to regain a starting role, even changing his private chef, and eyebrows will be raised if Amorim snubs him again.",
      "Amorim is not helping himself with selection decisions and his handling of Mainoo has been questionable.",
      "Sunderland love Amad",
      "Amad blossomed during his season-long loan with Sunderland in 2022/2023. The winger delivered consistently strong performances in the Championship and thoroughly enjoyed his time at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris was asked about Amad and said: \"His spell here was really important. The coaching staff likes him - as a person and as a player - so both. Now he will be an opponent. So it will be great to say hello but during the game he won't be a friend.\"",
      "Amad was unavailable against Brentford due to a family bereavement, but he is set to return to the squad this weekend. Amad has made a quiet start to the campaign and perhaps an appearance against Sunderland will spark him into life, as he has yet to find the back of the net this term.",
      "United's record against Sunderland",
      "United have lost just two of their last 30 league games against Sunderland, winning 22 of those matches and drawing six, which is a good omen for Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sunderland last won at Old Trafford in May 2014 when Ryan Giggs was in charge as interim manager. Sebastian Larsson's first-half goal secured Sunderland's first win at Old Trafford since 1968.",
      "The Black Cats are fifth in the table after making an impressive start to the campaign, so they will be hopeful of causing an upset, but United are unbeaten in their last 24 league games against newly promoted sides.",
      "Amorim's body langauge",
      "If you're attending the game at Old Trafford this afternoon, it's worth watching Amorim on the touchline because he has looked like a manager under pressure in the last few weeks.",
      "It can often be fascinating to watch Amorim's behaviour on the touchline. He is rarely happy with what he sees on the pitch and almost looks desperate to get involved.",
      "Sunderland is a must-win for Amorim after suffering another setback against Brentford. International breaks are synonymous with managerial changes, and Amorim might need to win to survive.",
      "United have insisted Amorim retains the backing of the board - but that might change if United lose today.",
      "Malacia back in the squad?",
      "Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first team after a spell of training with the Under-21s. Malacia wanted to leave United in the summer, but a proposed move to Elche collapsed on deadline day.",
      "Club sources have stressed it was always the plan to reintegrate Malacia once he failed to find a new club.",
      "Malacia's reintroduction raises the possibility of him making a return to a matchday squad, although it seems unlikely he will be named on the bench against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim shipped Malacia out on loan to PSV in the January transfer window after deciding he was not good enough. It was the right decision to welcome Malacia back to first-team training, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will play a part in Amorim's plans in the next few months.",

      "Transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano has reported that the details are sealed and signed to finalise the deal for Orozco with the fee set at $1million (£741,000). The journalist has claimed that the United lawyers have approved the paperwork and the midfielder will move to England next summer.",
      "Orozco is set to arrive at Old Trafford with a similar profile to Sekou Kone. He signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1m in 2024, having impressed scouts at the Under-17 World Cup.",
      "It's understood that Orozco's performances at the recent Under-17 South American Championship were strong. United's focus on academy signings has expanded in recent years due to Brexit-related regulations.",
      "The regulations prevent them from signing players from European clubs, meaning other continents are being scouted. In January, a £3.3m deal, rising to £7m in add-ons, was agreed with Cerro Porteno to sign Diego Leon.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has endured another few days to forget following on from last weekend's defeat to Brentford in the Premier League. That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",
      "Garnacho was pivotal to Chelsea's winning goal against Benfica on Tuesday with his cross turned into his own net by Richard Rios. The Argentine has since posted an Instagram story captioned: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "24 hours later, Rashford assisted Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a perfectly-weighted pass. The European champions ultimately won the game, but Rashford was a livewire throughout with another clear message sent to Amorim as that is the 27-year-old's sixth goal contribution since moving",
      "Hojlund also sent an unexpectedly cheeky message after a clinical finish with his weaker right foot and a brave headed goal in Napoli's 2-1 win over Sporting CP with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne the supplier for both.",
      "When celebrating the first goal, the Denmark international pointed to the Champions League badge on his Napoli shirt.",
      "With three United outcasts impressing over the last few evenings, it is certainly a concerning indictment for Amorim especially in the wake of a negative result for United.",

      "The Portuguese coach has recorded just 19 wins from 49 matches in his first 11 months with the club, and despite leading them to the final of the Europa League, he has failed to figure things out domestically. After finishing 15th in 2024/25, United currently sit 14th in the division this term, with just two wins from six matches.",
      "With that said, we round-up some of the latest news surrounding the former Sporting CP boss' future.",
      "Gareth Southgate would reject an approach from United in the event Amorim is sacked. The former England boss was previously among the top contenders to become United boss in March 2024.",
      "While Southgate's determination to focus on England ahead of the European Championships prevented United's desire to enter talks on that occasion, the coach is not out of work.",
      "The Daily Star reports however, that Southgate is in no rush to return to football, and continues to keep his options open. Perhaps crucially, Southgate is close friends with Dan Ashworth, whose long-term plan was to appoint Southgate during his time at United before departing after five months.",
      "\"One or two matches, you get flashes. They [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager go about their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",
      "\"But you're not telling me he shouldn't be doing better, even with that system. You look at the players at the back - Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire - Bruno Fernandes going forward, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got good players.",
      "\"It doesn't look like the right fit and that's putting it mildly. There's a lot of talk that they're not going to sack him until a certain date towards the end of this year to save a pay-off.",
      "\"It's difficult to read the minds of the hierarchy at United as to what they're thinking, but I think they know and everyone will be telling them that it is time for a change.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Few appear certain that Amorim's position is secure, with journalist Fabrizio Romano suggesting while the coach is not going to be sacked imminently, upcoming games could prove crucial.",
      "\"I'm not here saying that Amorim is absolutely safe,\" he said. \"Amorim’s job is not absolutely safe in this moment because they need to perform in a different way because Man United want to see results.",
      "\"But it doesn't mean that Manchester United have met with Southgate or already started the process to appoint Gareth Southgate as new boss.",
      "\"So let's wait. Let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim may have one more month to convince United chiefs he is worth persisting with. It was previously reported that United may delay any sacking of Amorim until he reaches a year of service due to the substantial compensation package he would receive.",
      "As per the Daily Mail, United would need to pay up a hefty £12m bill if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in the hotseat.",
      "On the other hand, there are fears that Amorim could be the one to instigate the exit. United's co-owners, Ineos, are said to be worried that their boss might choose to resign before being dismissed.",
      "It is claimed that Amorim could do this in an attempt to preserve his managerial reputation, as he becomes increasingly frustrated by the constant criticism following losses.",
      "According to the i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are prepared to stand by their manager but Amorim might soon have to contemplate stepping down to 'preserve his managerial career'.",
      "The United boss believes assessments of United's defeats can be 'knee-jerk' reactions and is reportedly taken aback by the intense scrutiny surrounding his managerial tenure.",

He was told it was now or never, and United had their man.",
      "While the club's stance worked - and had United started this season in good form we'd all be praising the decision to appoint him mid-season in getting the teething problems out of the way last term - their ultimatum may well have done more harm than good.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe might be keen to view this campaign as Amorim's first at the club, but the disaster that was the 2024/25 season simply cannot be forgotten.",

      "Ruben Amorim will be under pressure to improve results following a tough start to the new campaign, with United having won only two of their six games, including a victory over Chelsea. The morale-boosting victory over Enzo Maresca's team was undone by Brentford, as they fell to a 3-1 defeat.",
      "\"Tough decisions and rumours are always part of this job so you have to accept it, you have to deal with it,\" Hurzeler said this week. \"But I really want to say that I have a lot of respect for Ruben Amorim so I won't talk about his job or any rumours that might come regarding him.",
      "\"I'm really privileged to be a coach for Brighton and Hove Albion, I'm very happy here and we still have a lot of work to do.\"",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the latest headlines as Amorim’s future continues to spark debate.",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down the opportunity to coach United, if Amorim was to be dismissed. Southgate is believed to not be in rush to return to football, but he is keeping his options open, reportedly within and beyond the sport.",
      "In March 2024, he emerged as a top candidate for the United job when Erik ten Hag's position was under threat, but he declined all approaches. Since leaving his role with England, Southgate has not returned to football, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work. He has also taken on a role hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "Additionally, talkSPORT reported that Southgate had emerged as one of three names on United's shortlist to potentially replace Amorim. But Fabrizio Romano has since dismissed those claims.",
      "MEN Sport says: While Amorim is thought to still have United’s backing, drawing up a list of potential replacements is not a bad idea if results fail to improve. It allows the club to plan ahead and be prepared.",
      "However, going behind the Portuguese manager's back to contact other candidates could seriously undermine Amorim at a particularly tough time for the United boss.",
      "United are targeting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba regardless of Amorim's future, according to TEAMtalk. United tried to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to reach a deal due to Brighton's high asking price.",
      "The Seagulls reportedly sought a fee similar to the £115million they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023. While Amorim is believed to be a big admirer, the report claims United are still set to pursue a move for the 21-year-old, regardless of whether the manager remains in charge.",
      "It is also claimed they could make a formal approach for his services next year. Liverpool are reportedly tracking the youngster as well.",
      "MEN Sport says: Regardless of whether Amorim remains in charge of the club next season, United should still pursue Baleba, as he represents a long-term investment for the squad. His talent, versatility, and potential for growth make him a player who could influence the team for years to come - and United need more of that.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "\"It was a must-win game and I don't think it lets him off the hook,\" Neville said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"There's too many defeats, the record's too poor so I don't think anybody will be celebrating too much tonight at Manchester United but I think they'll be relieved that there is a victory which allows a little bit of peace going into the international break.",
      "\"Manchester United win the odd game but that's nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"",
      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
      "That view was put to Neville, who hit back.",
      "He said: \"If pundits are getting into your head then you shouldn't be playing for the club.",
      "\"Do people not remember Alan Hanson criticising us when we broke in as young kids saying that you can't win anything with kids. That was the greatest centre-back of all time at that moment talking about us as if we were, you know, inferior and nowhere near good enough.",
      "\"Did they not think that we got criticised during our football careers. I'm sorry you're playing for Manchester United - it comes with the territory, you've got to step up.",
      "\"They've been hopeless in the system. If it's not the system, then the players are a problem, the manager is a problem, the whole thing's a problem if you're losing football matches to the level that they've been doing.",
      "\"I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches and I played in a dressing room that when you lost football matches you came in and you said sorry. There was accountability. Why would you blame other people. I've not got any time for excuse mentality shortcuts blaming other people - it's the worst thing that you can do in life.",
      "\"I think they just need to concentrate on doing their jobs and doing it well and winning football matches. The only thing that's going to shut anybody up is winning football matches and they've not won anywhere near enough.\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and tips more misery for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Burnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.",
      "The Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.",
      "The former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.",
      "Crystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.",
      "But they won't.",
      "As to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.",
      "A first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.",
      "Clubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.",
      "In a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.",
      "When Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.",
      "He's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.",
      "Yes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.",
      "Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.",
      "Wolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.",
      "The market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "There are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.",
      "The standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.",
      "Kayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.",
      "Douk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",
