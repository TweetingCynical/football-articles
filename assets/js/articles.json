      "Manchester United have the chance to sign Jonathan David on a free transfer this summer after he confirmed that he's leaving Lille. David, 25, won't sign a new contract with the French club and move on to pastures new when his current deal expires on June 30.",
      "The Canadian striker has been linked with United alongside a host of European giants for many years, having impressed for Lille ever since his move from Gent in 2020. David lifted the Ligue 1 title in his first season and has scored 109 goals in 231 games for Les Dogues, putting him third in the club's all-time goalscorer charts.",
      "That kind of output would be ideal for United, who've prioritised signing a striker in the summer transfer window. The Red Devils want an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who've scored a combined 17 goals this season compared to David's 25.",
      "The 25-year-old has also chipped in with 12 assists, as Lille head into the final day on Saturday battling for fourth place which would earn them a spot in the Europa League. But if they qualify, David won't be a part of it.",
      "\"I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club, it's time for me to say goodbye,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram. \"I've spent five wonderful seasons here, I know it hasn't always been easy, but I hope that with my goals and celebrations, I've managed to bring you some joy, especially with the French championship title and the Champions Trophy.\"",
      "Thanking his team-mates, David added: \"I know I didn't have the easiest start, but you've always been behind me, you've supported me through the tough times, and for that, I'll keep you in my heart.\"",
      "The Canada international has most recently been linked with Napoli as well as Barcelona and Newcastle. David isn't the only striker on United's radar either, with Liam Delap understood to be their No.1 target and available for £30million following Ipswich's relegation.",
      "But the fact that United wouldn't have to pay a fee for David could sway them. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear the Red Devils are in a precarious financial position which makes winning the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday even more important, as it'd guarantee them a place in next season's Champions League which is worth roughly £100m."

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has seen his wealth decrease by almost £6.5billion over the last 12 months. The British billionaire's staggering loss was the biggest among those included on The Sunday Times Rich List 2025.",
      "Ratcliffe was ranked fourth in the 2024 list and topped the standings in 2018. But he has now fallen to become the seventh-richest individual in Britain, behind the likes of Sir James Dyson and Gopi Hinduja and family, who sits atop the list.",
      "The INEOS chief, who competed a deal to buy into United last year, was worth £23.519billion in the 2024 Rich List. However, that has now decreased by £6.473bn to £17.046bn.",
      "Ratcliffe still maintains a very healthy net worth but, given the financial struggles the Red Devils have endured in recent years, it certainly doesn't bode well for fans hoping for an immediate return to success under the Failsworth-born businessman.",
      "Ratcliffe has been brutally honest about the dire financial situation he's walked into at Old Trafford since arriving at the club in February 2024.",
      "Despite the 13-time Premier League champions consistently ranking as one of the largest revenue-generating teams in world football, the 72-year-old stunned supporters in his wide-ranging interview with Gary Neville earlier this year.",
      "It was in March that he claimed the club were set to run out of money this year without his £232m ($300m) investment. \"Manchester United would have run out of money at the end of this year. November this year, the club runs out of cash,\" he told the United legend.",
      "Ratcliffe - who has led multiple redundancy rounds at the club since his arrival - explained just how serious the financial situation has evolved. \"If you think about Manchester United as a business, it’s gone off the rails. It’s gone off the rails a long way, really,\" he said.",
      "\"If you look at the numbers, the numbers were fairly scary, really. Because they’d sort of lost control, I think, of where the ship was headed. And the costs had got out of control.",
      "\"If you think of it in really simple terms, you’ve got the operating costs, which are all the staff and the fixed costs of running the business. And then you’ve got all the squad costs, player salaries and player purchases.",
      "\"In super-simple terms, the club has been spending more money than it’s been earning now for the last seven years, and it ends in a very difficult place.\"",
      "With United set to finish no higher than 13th in the league this season, their miserable campaign can be somewhat saved should they claim victory in the Europa League final on Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Not only would a win capture a piece of silverware for a third season straight, it would also be Ruben Amorim's first for the club and could see them bank £100m in revenue given they'll qualify for the Champions League."

      "Those making it onto this year list needed to scrape by on at least £350million. At the top is Indian-born British businessman Gopi Hinduja and his family, with a wealth put at £35.billion, though down from £37billion last year.",
      "The list took in both inherited wealth and self-made tycoons. The latter includes ex-market trader Tom Morris, who is behind booming discount chain Home Bargains, and is known as Liverpool’s richest man. The publicity-shy businessman is in 26th place on the list, with his fortune growing from £6.67billion to almost £7billion.",
      "Talking of Liverpool, new entrants this year include Tom and Phil Beahon, the brothers who launched Castore, the sporting brand worn by England’s rugby and cricket teams. They started the business from their parents’ Liverpool home, and have hit the big leagues at £350million, despite still being aged in their 30s.",
      "Interviewed by the Mirror in 2023, former Tranmere Rovers footballer Tom Beahon said he still drove his old VW Polo. “I am still the proud owner of a white VW Polo that must be seven, eight years old. I still drive that,” he said. “I’ve not been on holiday for a while. Neither my brother nor I are massively materialistic people.”",
      "King Charles could only make it to 238rd on the list, though his estimated fortune has risen from £610million to £640million. That put him on level pegging with former Tory PM Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty.",
      "Meanwhile, the godfather to both Prince George and Prince Archie has lost a whopping £243million in the last 12 months. But the Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, was still ranked as the 14th wealthiest man in Britain with an overall family wealth of £9.8billion.",
      "The Rich List also includes a host of celebrities, including Rolling Stones’ legends Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, each with a wealth of £440million - up from £415million in 2024 - and putting them in joint 295th place. Above them is Sir Elton John, with the Rocket Man in 283rd, having amassed a cool £475million of wealth.",
      "Notable entries from the world of sport include FI ace Sir Lewis Hamilton, whose estimated wealth has accelerated from £350million to £385million in the past year. And after just celebrating his 50th birthday in lavish style, David Beckham - along with wife Victoria - are said to be worth half a billion, and up from £455million in 2024. That said, it comes amid reports of ongoing tensions within the Beckham family.",
      "manchester-united-fc>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's fortunes match the team's performance on the pitch, as it emerged his wealth had plunged by an estimated £6.5billion in the past year. The chemicals magnate, whose Ineos Group bought a near 28% stake in United in February 2024, was the biggest faller on this year’s The Sunday Times Rich List.",
      "The 72-year-old is still worth an eye-watering £17billion, but has slipped to seventh place - having led the rankings of Britain’s mega-wealthy in 2018. The slump was fuelled by losses at his Ineos empire, where debts have grown. The group has also been impacted by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs.",
      "It emerged as his struggling United team take on fellow under-performers Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday. However, he is far from alone when it comes to a drop among the super-rich.",
      "Finally, Barbara Broccoli and half brother Michael G Wilson are said be worth £450million after relinquishing creative control of the 007 James Bond movies to Amazon.",
      "Luke Hildyard, executive director of think tank the High Pay Centre, said: “The Rich List is a useful annual reminder of the inefficiency of the UK economy. It shows a small fall in the value of oligarch assets this year, but over a longer period it illustrates how a tiny handful of very rich people have captured an increasing share of the country’s wealth.",
      "If the super-rich and the companies they own were taxed more effectively and paid the people that work for them a better wage, living standards in Britain would be much higher. Meanwhile the Rich List entrants would still be extremely rich by any reasonable person’s definition and well rewarded for whatever success they have achieved.”",
      "This year’s list of 350 individuals and families together hold combined wealth of £772.8billion - 3% down on last year.",
      "Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, said: “Our billionaire count is down and the combined wealth of those who feature in our research is falling. We are also finding fewer of the world’s super-rich are coming to live in the UK.”",
      "He warned there was growing anger among the mega-rich about the expected abolition of non-dom status and tax changes. That is despite millions of ordinary families struggling to make ends mean and Chancellor Rachel Reeves forced to slash spending, and unleash welfare cuts, to plug a blackhole in the government’s finances left by the Tories."

      "The Red Devils head into Friday's fixture in 16th with a mere 39 points - a result of just ten wins and nine draws this term. United are on track for their worst-ever finish in the Premier League, with 13th their best possible finish come the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has failed to impress in the Premier League, despite United's performances in Europe and, as a result, the Old Trafford head into the match at Stamford Bridge without a win in their last seven league games. They do still have the silver lining of a Europa League final to look forward to, though, with that match up against Tottenham pencilled in for Wednesday, 21st May.",

      "Chelsea vs Manchester United gets underway at 8.15pm on Friday night at Stamford Bridge. It is one of two fixtures taking place on the night, with Aston Villa also facing Spurs at Villa Park at an earlier time of 7.30pm."

The attacking midfielder has been offered to United and Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window opening.",

      "Real Madrid are keen on a move for the Benfica left back Alvaro Carreras but Manchester United could still have a significant say over whether a deal is completed, according to reports.",
      "United sold Carreras to Benfica last year for just £5m and had previously been linked with re-signing the defender after he became a star man for the Portuguese giants.",
      "But now Real, who are set to welcome in Xabi Alonso as their new head coach next month following confirmation that Carlo Ancelotti will depart when La Liga concludes next week, are keen on a deal in addition to bringing in Trent Alexander-Arnold as a free agent when his Liverpool contract expires.",
      "Benfica will allow Carreras to leave for a fee of €50m but Spanish outlet Marca have suggested that Real are weighing up whether to liaise with United in very strange circumstances.",
      "That is because United had a buy-back clause of £15m added into the deal that saw Carreras leave for Lisbon but they turned down that option in January.",
      "Yet Marca’s report says Real are wondering if United could activate that clause before then offering the Premier League giants a fee midway between that and Benfica’s asking price to buy him.",
      "United continue to trim costs under the ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has overseen two rounds of redundancies along with trimming the squad's wage bill. Several big name players are set to depart this summer, including Marcus Rashford, who is on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Ruben Amorim faces a decisive Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next Wednesday with the prize of a spot in next season’s Champions League on offer.",
      "That will have huge financial implications for the club because a season in Europe’s top competition can be worth in excess of £100m depending on a team’s progress.",
      "And while United players will be given pay rises if they compete in the Champions League, there are other considerations such as the reduction in sponsorship payments should they miss out.",
      "Carrera came through at the academy of Spanish side Deportivo La Coruna before signing a four-year deal at United. However he did not make a first-team appearance before heading to Benfica, where he has quickly established himself as one of the best left backs in Europe."

      "Manchester United won't spend significant funds on a new goalkeeper this summer after Ruben Amorim decided on other priorities. Andre Onana's future at Old Trafford has been under the microscope after failing to cut errors out of his game.",
      "Onana, 29, was dropped by Amorim last month after two howlers against Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals. His understudy, Altay Bayindir, has featured more regularly as the season has worn on but his performances haven't inspired confidence.",
      "It was reported at the turn of the year that Amorim wants to sign a new goalkeeper who can push Onana. With the Cameroonian continuing to make high-profile mistakes, an increasing number of fans want the club to go searching for a direct replacement.",
      "The former Inter Milan shot-stopper wants to stay, though, and his recent decision to change agencies wasn't made with a view to a transfer. Turkey international Bayindir, however, could be the one to leave Old Trafford in search of more regular starts, with the 2026 World Cup a year away.",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton is in the final few weeks of his current contract and turned 39 last week. Senior United figures hope that Onana can rediscover his best form which he's rarely showcased since his £47million transfer from Inter in 2023.",
      "Those same figures and Amorim have prioritised bringing in a playmaker, a striker and a midfielder. United hope to make three or four key signings and Champions League revenue would help them secure their top targets.",
      "In order to bank that, the Red Devils need to win the Europa League final next Wednesday. Amorim's side face Tottenham, with Onana expected to start.",
      "Amorim was recently asked whether he'd consider signing a new goalkeeper in the summer transfer window. \"We are going to make that evaluation for any position in the squad,\" the United manager replied. \"You can see my record [too] - my record is the worst in the team.",

      "Speaking to Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: “It was always Manchester United because of the size of the club, not because it’s Man U – but due to the sheer grandeur, particularly back then. I know they are going through a tough run at the minute, but the whole worldwide feel of it. That’s a big superpowered club.”",
      "Dyche added: “He [Ruben Amorim] better win some games – pretty quick. I reckon if I went there and played my way, we’d win more games. Just 4-4-2 – give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don’t have to over teach everyone.",
      "“I’d be interested more in the longer run, if he can stick to his principles and then next season, we’re all going, ‘Fair play’ – but, he’s been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.",
      "“I’d be surprised if Ruben Amorim is not under pressure [early next season]. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt this season – he’s laying down his platform for success, the future, and educating, let’s say.",
      "\"Then you get your pre-season, because now you’ve got that window to actually work on it, day in, day out. Shift a few players out who maybe don’t buy in, shift the players in who do buy in. Then, if it’s not early next season, how long do you go?",
      "“The perfect scenario is at least if you get a pre-season and juggle the transfers, then by Christmas, if you’re not having some form of success – most people go, ‘Things need to start working pretty quickly’. You probably get the next window, and then by January/February, they are going, ‘It’s not working’.”",
      "Fortunately for Amorim, he has a way of rescuing United’s season and ensure Dyche stays away from Old Trafford. United take on Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month and will secure a spot in the Champions League should they secure victory."

      "Manchester United chief Jason Wilcox is on the lookout for a new academy coach after Adam Lawrence left as he sought opportunities as first-team boss. The 39-year-old has had several offers and is now weighing up his options - but has left a vacancy at Carrington.",
      "Lawrence's exit had been likely and he's looking to work in a first-team environment but is equally open to a fresh academy challenge. Wilcox and Nick Cox are now eyeing someone to replace the outgoing coach with talks already underway, reports the MEN.",
      "Wilcox is among those bought to Manchester under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe reign and served as technical director, but did step in as sporting director. Wilcox, earlier in his career, served as academy director at Manchester City and has proven himself in that capacity.",
      "He helped unearth the likes of Phil Foden and United will hope that experience aids them in their recruitment process as they look to continue their strong academy tradition. The club have backed youth for years and continue to produce young talent.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the latest graduate who has become a first-team regular and those involved in the academy set-up will be tasked with producing more players of that quality to aid the squad.",
      "Neil Wood was the last high-profile coaching departure from the academy. He had managed the U21s for three years and that helped him get appointed at the Salford City boss with the Class of 92 holding a high opinion of him - he led the club to the League Two play-offs.",
      "Amorim gave 27 debuts to academy players during his time in charge at Sporting Lisbon - several of those going on to become key players - and he is already showing faith in United’s young talent this season. Recently handing debuts to the likes of Tyler Fredricson",
      "Cox, who is the Head of the academy, said on Lawrence's efforts: \"Adam has contributed greatly to our club throughout his four years at Manchester United. His passion for helping young players to maximise their potential has played an important role in the success of our academy system.",
      "\"We take great pride in supporting and witnessing the development of our staff, Adam is a fine example of that, moving up from the Under-16s to the Under-18s, enjoying success and now being ready to seek a new challenge in the game.\""

      "A former Manchester United prospect, once hailed as the club's \"best young player\", turned hero for Leyton Orient as they punched their ticket to Wembley. Ethan Galbraith, who spent six years in United's ranks, netted the match-winning penalty in a tense shootout win over Stockport County on Wednesday night.",
      "The victory secured Orient's spot in the League One Play-Off final, and leaves them within touching distance of a return to the second tier of English football for the first time in 43 years.",
      "Galbraith has been a key figure throughout their promotion charge, regularly featuring in the starting XI and chipping in with crucial goals – including a brace against Stockport earlier this season.",
      "His influence won't come as a shock to those familiar with United's youth system. The 24-year-old Northern Irishman had once been seen as a serious candidate to break into the Red Devils' senior squad.",
      "Having arrived from Linfield in 2017, it didn't take long for Galbraith to make an impression. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave him his first-team debut against Astana during the 2019/20 Europa League, having already been impressed with his performances for the U21s and in senior training sessions.",
      "A source told MEN in August 2020: \"He's the best young player outside the core first-team group at the club.\" However, Galbraith struggled to consistently deliver at the top level.",
      "After a friendly against Aston Villa in September, Solskjaer was openly critical of his play, frustrated with how often he lost possession. \"Galbraith... I spoke to him after the game and he knows a couple of times he gets caught on the ball but that's the learning he needs,\" the Norwegian coach said. \"That's going to make him, next time he's on the pitch, be ready for it.\"",
      "The midfielder was then loaned to Doncaster Rovers in League One for the 2021/22 season, followed by a spell at Salford City in League Two. Though he impressed in both stints, he hadn't quite progressed at the speed United had envisioned.",
      "Galbraith's chapter at the club came to a close in 2023, with new United boss Erik ten Hag showing little interest in him. With his deal expiring and no offer to extend it, Galbraith accepted defeat and looked elsewhere.",
      "\"After six years, my time has come to an end with this magnificent club, Manchester United,\" he wrote on social media at the time. \"My earliest ambition as a boy was to become a professional footballer and I'm forever grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity and support to fulfil that dream.",
      "\"It's been a privilege and I feel very honoured to have been able to represent the club. I step into the next chapter of my career a more mature, well rounded person and I'm excited for what's next.\"",
      "That next step was a gamble. Though there was interest from clubs like Newcastle, Stoke, and Derby, Galbraith chose to sign with newly promoted League One outfit Leyton Orient, seeking regular minutes on the pitch.",
      "He quickly adapted to life in east London, playing a major part in helping Orient to their best league finish in over ten years during his debut campaign. Year two has gone even better, with Richie Wellens' men launching a late-season surge to secure a surprise spot in the play-offs.",
      "In the return leg against Stockport, Galbraith didn't just convert the decisive penalty - he also set up Ollie O'Neill's opener, delivering a complete performance that saw him named Player of the Match.",
      "With a Wembley showdown on the horizon and the chance to earn promotion, Galbraith now has an opportunity to demonstrate - both to those watching and perhaps those back at Carrington - that he was right to back himself.",
      "If he leads Orient to victory, it may not only be a landmark moment for the club but also a personal comeback story for a footballer still striving for the heights he once seemed destined to reach."

      "Manchester United prospect James Overy made his first appearance in a senior team training session on Wednesday. United secured Overy on a scholarship deal last summer after beating a number of Premier League rivals to his signature.",

      "Primarily a right-back, Overy is eligible to play for Australia, England, and Scotland on the international stage. Reflecting on Overy's journey after his academy debut, ex-U18 boss Adam Lawrence praised his attitude during his time off the pitch.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's been really hard for James because obviously he's made the move from Australia and he's a terrific lad, first of all.",
      "\"But he got injured in pre-season and you can see he's such a great lad, a great kid and has such good energy and he wanted to be back. A real credit to him because he stayed positive throughout.",
      "\"It's not affected him in terms of his positivity. And listen, it's obviously disappointing what's happened in the game, but for him to be back and playing football again is brilliant.\"",
      "United's youth setup continues to be renowned as one of the finest, with their scouts on the hunt for young talents capable of stepping up to the senior squad.",
      "Promising youngsters are granted scholarship deals, marking a significant step towards the possibility of clinching a professional contract, which they are eligible to sign from the age of 17.",
      "At just 15, Overy turned heads among Premier League scouts with a standout performance for Perth Glory's first team in a pre-season friendly against West Ham in the summer of 2023.",

      "Manchester United are seven games without a win in the Premier League and last won at Stamford Bridge in February 2020.",

      "Chelsea have their own European final to prepare for but do not come up against Antony in the Conference League until Wednesday week. United's most consequential match in years against Tottenham is on Wednesday.",
      "This is United's antepenultimate fixture in what has hitherto been their worst season in 51 years. Here are five things to look out for at Chelsea tonight:",
      "Hints at final XI?",
      "The five-day gap United have between Chelsea and the Europa League final should ensure Amorim picks a reasonably strong side. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro and Alejandro Garnacho, all benched against West Ham United, could return.",
      "The majority who do not play tonight can effectively be discounted as a starter against Spurs. The only allowance Amorim could make is for Leny Yoro, given how recent his foot injury was.",
      "Another unwanted stat?",
      "Last week marked the first time United have gone seven league games without a win since November 1992. Weeks after that winless run, Eric Cantona was paraded at Old Trafford.",
      "It is too late for a signing to save this league season for United and more records could still tumble before next week's finale against Aston Villa. Fail to beat Chelsea tonight and it is the first eight-game winless streak in the league since January 1990, the last season that United finished in the bottom half. The season ended with Alex Ferguson's first trophy in the FA Cup.",
      "Centre back trial and error?",
      "Noussair Mazraoui was one of the players to speak at United's Uefa media day on Wednesday, a signal he will start in Bilbao. Mazraoui has started in all but eight of United's 57 matches this season and merits inclusion in Amorim's XI next week.",
      "The Moroccan played in a back three against West Ham, with Amad on the right. That seemed to be a dress rehearsal for their possible roles against Spurs and the injury to Yoro should not necessarily have a bearing on that.",
      "Yet if Yoro is out, Amorim will have to consider Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof. Shaw was taken off at the same time as Yoro against West Ham to protect him amid the spate of injuries at centre back. Lindelof lined up in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ayden Heaven has travelled with the squad for tonight's game but he hasn't played since the 3-0 win over Leicester two months ago.",
      "Where does Amad start?",
      "Whatever United's best team is, Amad has to be in it. Amorim has played Amad on the wing and as one of the two No.10s since his return from an ankle injury two weeks ago.",
      "Amad has scored one goal, assisted another, helped change the game against Athletic in the second leg and was United's sole positive against West Ham.",
      "A rousing send-off",
      "The switch of the away end at Stamford Bridge from the east stand to the Shed End in 2005 has seen the ground host some raucous United atmospheres over the past 20 years. The ridiculous 7pm Sunday night kick-off United had at Leicester in March made no difference to United's supporters, who were in their finest voice all season.",
      "A similar atmosphere is probable this evening. United are five days out from a European final and their matchgoers will sing about it incessantly. Some will doubtless remain in London and fly to Bilbao from Heathrow or Gatwick."

      "The voting for the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award officially opened this week.",
      "Manchester United have endured an abysmal Premier League season, but someone will be named POTY and Bruno Fernandes is the hot favourite to claim the prize for a second successive year.",
      "Fernandes won the award for a third time last season and is looking to emulate David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo, who are the only players to have won the prize on four occasions.",
      "Most believe Fernandes is a shoo-in for the award and you certainly wouldn't bet against him winning it again. Fernandes has continued to be a driving force in a struggling team this season and United might have been dragged into a relegation scrap without him.",
      "And would United be in the Europa League final without Fernandes? He has contributed seven goals and five assists in the competition, including a brace against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Fernandes will be remembered among the greatest United captains when he eventually leaves the club. He is a Bryan Robson-esque figure and would be a worthy winner of POTY again.",
      "Yet there could be a cat put among the pigeons if Amad can sprinkle some magic in next week's Europa League final. Amad was a leading contender for the POTY award until he sustained an ankle injury during training in February.",
      "It's easy to forget that Amad had arguably become United's most important player in the winter. He scored the matchwinner against Manchester City in December, the equaliser against Liverpool at Anfield and netted a sensational 10 minute hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "Amad's momentum was disrupted by injury, but any concerns that he'd take a while to get up to speed after his return have been made to look pretty daft over the last three weeks.",
      "He scored off the bench against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium, doing brilliantly to create an opening, and he was the gamechanger when he came on against Bilbao at Old Trafford.",
      "His performance in the second leg helped United kill the tie at a time in the game when Bilbao were pushing to extend their 1-0 advantage. It was also the type of display that will make it impossible for Ruben Amorim not to start Amad against Tottenham in the final.",
      "Amad is far too influential to be named on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames and, if he delivers in the final, he could win the POTY award from Fernandes.",
      "The POTY award will not be on Fernandes' or Amad's mind. They will be focused on winning the Europa League, but it might not be the one-horse race that most believe.",
      "Amad has consolidated himself as a star this season after being in and out Erik Ten Hag's starting team. It would be fascinating to hear why Ten Hag overlooked him so often, as that decision has become even more confusing.",
      "Sources have always maintained that Amad is an elite trainer during sessions at Carrington, so the Dutchman's decision to overlook him must have simply been due to his perceived level.",
      "Ten Hag's assessment of Amad was wrong and the youngster will be ready for the Europa League final. He seems to embrace the biggest stage and could end the season on a huge high."

      "The sight of Leny Yoro limping his way down the touchline during the second half of Manchester United's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United last weekend was the last thing Ruben Amorim needed.",
      "United were already without Matthijs de Ligt, Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez. Yoro was forced off less than ten minutes into the second half after going down clutching his left foot. His absence, along with De Ligt's, from Wednesday morning's open training session at Carrington sparked fears he could be in danger of missing next week's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "Those fears were confirmed later in the day when Amorim said: \"I don't know if they're going to be available, we'll try to push, it's a final, all the players want to play really bad. I don't think they will not go to Chelsea but we'll have some of them for the final.\"",
      "The prospect of De Ligt and Yoro both missing the final will leave United light on options at centre-back. Martinez will not play again this season and Heaven, despite being back in the squad for the trip to Chelsea, will need time to build up his sharpness after two months without playing.",
      "It means Amorim could find himself boarding the plane to Bilbao next week with a senior centre-back pool of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Heaven.",
      "Maguire, regardless of what happens with De Ligt and Yoro between now and the middle of next week, should start against Spurs. He has continued his renaissance this season and has played a starring role in United's Europa League campaign.",
      "However, Lindelof, despite starting both legs of the semi-final triumph against Athletic Bilbao, and Evans, have not been front and centre of United's defence this season. The pair of them are also highly likely to be released this summer.",
      "Amorim may find himself having to ask Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw to tuck into the back-three and operate as the wide centre-backs either side of Maguire.",
      "Mazraoui, who was originally signed last summer to challenge Diogo Dalot at right-back in a back-four, has often played at centre-back under Amorim. The prospect of him starting at right-sided centre-back would open the door for Amad to start at right wing-back, or possibly Dalot, who is also fighting to be fit in time for the final.",
      "On the other side of Maguire, Shaw is realistic option to start. Since making his long-awaited return from injury in April, the former Southampton man has made seven appearances, with practically all of his game time coming as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "His left-footed profile offers United balance and he lacks the athleticism to operate as a wing-back in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Heaven, too, is left-footed and is in contention to feature in the capital, but it feels unlikely that he will be thrown straight in after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "It means Amorim could set out his blueprint for the Europa League final by selecting a back-three of Mazraoui, Maguire and Shaw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge this evening, which would mark the first time they have started alongside each other as the three centre-backs..",
      "Amorim has hinted that he plans to name a strong XI for the trip to the capital, meaning he must strike the right balance between ensuring his players maintain their match sharpness and not taking any unnecessary risks on key players ahead of the tussle with Spurs.",
      "Tyler Fredricson has had a few opportunities in the Premier League of late, but he is very unlikely to start against Spurs, meaning Amorim may overlook him against Chelsea and instead experiment with a back-three that could easily end up starting in Spain."

Casemiro is likely to start given he didn't feature against West Ham and he could join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",

But I grew up watching a lot of La Liga. I wouldn’t say that would be my preferred league, but I think that’s a league that I enjoyed watching the most… I think one day, I would like to play there. But will that happen? I don’t know. I’m not opposed to anything, and we’ll just see where the future takes us.",
      "Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, David announced to his followers that he will be leaving Lille at the end of the season.",
      "This has undoubtedly put Premier League clubs needing a striker on the cheap - like United - on notice. With 25 goals to his name this season, United cannot afford to ignore him, surely?",
      "I wanted to tell you myself that after so many years at the club it's time for me to say goodbye. I've had five wonderful seasons here. I know it hasn't always been easy but I hope that my goals and my celebrations have managed to bring you some joy. I would like to thank all of my teammates, all of the coaches - staff, technical, medical team, all of the managers, everyone I have met and spent months with at the club. Thank you very much for everything you have given me personally over the years."

      "Regarding the team news, United will be without defenders Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt for the trip to the capital. The pair were absent from Wednesday's open training session at Carrington and are both in a race against time to be fit for the Europa League final next week.",
      "This is how our writers think United should line up...",
      "Amorim will pick this team with the Europa League final at the forefront of his thinking and I've attempted to do the same. It didn't make much sense to rest Onana last weekend and he should be recalled.",
      "Garnacho is the only other player in my team who I'd start in the final in Bilbao. Garnacho would ideally be named on the bench, but he probably needs to start due to the lack of options.",

      "It makes sense to recall Onana ahead of him starting in midweek, but the United boss has big calls to make at centre-back. With De Ligt and Yoro fighting against the clock to be fit, it would be too dangerous to risk Harry Maguire.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are highly likely start side-by-side in Bilbao after some stellar midfield performances in Europe. However, after not playing against West Ham, Casemiro needs minutes to ensure he remains sharp.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is United's only available striker in the Europa League, meaning Amorim would be taking an almighty gamble by starting him at Stamford Bridge. Amad needs more minutes in his legs ahead of starting the final."

      "Pogba has not played a competitive minute of first-team football since August 2023 after failing a doping test. He was subsequently handed a four-year ban which looked like it would end his professional playing career.",
      "However, following an appeal, the ban was reduced to 18 months, meaning he was free to resume training in January and make his return to competitive action in March. Pogba has since been linked with a third return to United and a move to MLS or Saudi Arabia, but he is still a free agent and looking for his next club.",
      "In the meantime, Pogba appears to be focusing his career elsewhere. On Wednesday, Pogba appeared to have launched his own 'unbreakable' jewellery range in a statement on Instagram.",
      "Alongside a video of Pogba displaying the jewellery on his wrist, neck and ears among other areas, he said in a caption: \"UNBREAKABLE. Forged by Strength, United by Love. May 21st 2025. A collection signed Elke Berr X Paul & Zulay Pogba. #Unbreakable. #PaulPogba. #ZulayPogba. #ElkeBerr.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard are among his former Manchester United teammates to like the post, as they showed support for the midfielder, who spent six years at Old Trafford in his second spell.",

      "\"First, I need to get back into my rhythm,\" said Pogba when asked about playing for France again. \"In the national team, it's not really the club that matters.

      "According to Marca, the 22-year-old's arrival is of elevated importance as Los Blancos want to strengthen the team for their new manager, with Xabi Alonso expected to take charge of Los Blancos starting in the FIFA Club World Cup next month.",
      "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold looks certain to be signing for free and reports elsewhere have also stated that Bournemouth talent Dean Huijsen's £50m release clause has been activated.",
      "A move for Carreras could bring Man United into play, however, as they still possess two significant clauses of their own relating to the left-back and his time at Benfica.",
      "When United sold to the defender to the Liga Portugal outfit for £5m - potentially rising to £8m with add-ons - at the end of a successful loan 12 months ago, Old Trafford chiefs first covered themselves in the exact case the Spaniard developed into a player sought after by Europe's top clubs.",
      "To prevent a potential rival from strengthening whilst improving themselves, a buy-back option worth around £15m was included.",
      "Therefore in theory, Real could be beaten to the transfer at a fraction of the €50m (£42.1m) release clause that Marca say other clubs have to pay.",
      "It is the Spanish publication's belief that Man United would not take up their option, paving the way for Alonso and Co.",
      "Top priority is strengthening Ruben Amorim's attack, after that a midfielder is desired and then other signings would be driven by outgoings.",
      "The other clause Man United included in Carreras' exit to Benfica was a significant sell-on clause, in the eventuality he did move on to a different club so they are still able to bank a tidy fee.",
      "Another crafty possibility, one which would greatly aid the club's compliance with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) would be to re-sign Carreras then sell him straight to Real themselves.",

I think they have a better chance of doing that now Ruben Amorim is the manager. Without stating the obvious, the fact they’re both Portuguese will help in the club’s efforts to keep him, but if a big European club came in, I could see him leaving.",
      "“I can’t see Bruno heading to Saudi though; he’s not ready for that. I believe he’s a lot better than that in terms of ability – he’s not entered the stage in his career where he needs to be considering a final big-money move.”",

      "The 21-year-old already has the backing of Liverpool‘s boo boys and has immense potential as a more rounded full-back than Alexander-Arnold with his strength in defensive duels, but it’s a huge ask to step up to being Arne Slot’s preferred right-back after only making 28 Premier League appearances.",

      "“I would select every single Tottenham player. The goalkeeper is a 50-50 split because I don’t like (Guglielmo) Vicario and I’m not a fan of (Andre) Onana.",
      "“Honestly, Udogie, Porro, Van de Ven, Romero, Bissouma, Sarr, Johnson, Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Son, I would choose every single player of Tottenham’s over Manchester United’s next Wednesday. That’s my worry.”",
      "He continued: “The one thing that keeps me alive – the likes of a Casemiro, a Bruno, they’ve got something in them that will step up for a one-off game, that means I think that we’ll win.",
      "“But if the players play as they should do, pound-for-pound, Tottenham should win that game.”",
      "Scholes reckons United’s recent history of finding a way to get over the line will prove decisive despite his former side losing to Spurs three times already this season, claiming the Red Devils are similar to Real Madrid in that regard.",

      "“Look at Real Madrid in the last five years. They’ve not been a great team at time but that history just takes them to it.",
      "“Realistically they should win it, they’ve beaten us the last three games. I think you’ll probably be the best team on the night, play really well but we’ll win.",
      "“We seem to find 10 or 15 minute spells where we win games. I think that’s what’ll happen.”",

      "Neville agreed, adding: “It’s not about history really, it’s about a club mentality because history sounds like it’s sort of nostalgic, it’s not.",
      "“It’s a mentality of a fanbase and club that think we’re going there and not coming out of this city until we’ve won. We know that can change, that could look stupid next Wednesday.",

      "Man Utd and their owners dominate the Mailbox as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his vulture capitalism are more than a match for the Glazers.",
      "Come on, let’s have some different subjects; mail us at theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Good news\nDelighted to see that Reading have been taken over by a guy that seems, at least from the outside, interested in running a football club and that club being good at football. No community should go through losing a club, and it seemed all too possible.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe is like Gordon Gekko\nSo Lee wrote in to support Ratcliffe. Just to be clear it’s a different Lee because this Lee would only ever be caught saying Chuck Feeney is a decent billionaire (Google him, it’s a good story ) the rest are just self serving vultures.",
      "There’s a couple of things I’d like to challenge in Lee’s mail",
      "1. We don’t know if Ratcliffe will turn the club around?",
      "2. He’s a self-made billionaire",
      "Answering question 2 will actually answer question 1 so we’ll start there.",
      "There is no such thing as a self made billionaire. Every billionaire starts from a position of middle-class safety in which they have a family which funds their living costs while they build their dream, Jobs, Gates, Musk, all had it. Ratcliffe had two working class parents who had become middle class thanks to their work which gave Ratcliffe the middle class base he needed.",
      "He also got his start in petrochemicals after convincing Esso to pay for his MBA, so that’s three different people who have helped him already but like I said there is no such thing as a self made billionaire.",
      "But this doesn’t mean a billionaire doesn’t work hard, most work long hours and rarely take holidays. So did Jim. But Jim didn’t get where he is by being a brilliant engineer and inventing something amazing or even being a chemical engineer and inventing something. His wealth comes almost entirely from raising private capital which he would then use to buy struggling companies, asset stripping them and moving their headquarters to tax havens.",
      "His chemical businesses in Middlesbrough also regularly just ignore environmental warnings about air and water pollution so if the air and water is terrible – his company is a big reason why.",
      "But his general MO in every case is as follows – identify struggling business with assets which can be sold. Buy very cheap. Immediately cut staff, sell assets, change HQ to tax haven and then pocket the money while publicly claiming the business is struggling and needs to cut costs.\nSound familiar?",
      "Jim is a proud Manc and English man. So proud that he campaigned for Brexit to give Britain back to the British and then once the vote had been taken immediately moved his personal residence to Monaco so he didn’t have to pay UK taxes and support UK services and economy.",
      "Jim is not Lou Gertsner or Warren Buffet who invest in businesses to make them succeed. He’s closer to Gordon Gekko, a vulture capitalist who bends rules (or ignores them) to benefit himself while putting thousands of people out of work.",
      "Will he turn around United? Why don’t we ask the fans of OGC Nice – the other team Ratcliffe owns…",
      "He bought Nice for 100m when they were struggling financially, he immediately came in promising greatness while making massive cuts to staff. Managers last on average 14 months before being fired.",
      "In the six years before Ratcliffe bought the club nice finished in the top 4 three times. Since he bought it? 0 times. At first fans liked Jim as they saw him attending games regularly, this changed within two years especially when Jim was caught saying ‘Nice games just aren’t very interesting to him’.",
      "Today the Nice supporters often protest Jim’s ownership stating he promised a lot and never delivered anything but constant change and chaos.",
      "So my guess….is Jim probably won’t save United. But he will be en excellent bullet shield for the Glazers for a few years.\nLee (the LFC one)",
      "",
      "BBQ fine though\nIt’s simple, United don’t do parades for anything but Premier League and Champions League. Haven’t had a parade since Fergie’s last season.",
      "Kind of of a ‘nothing to see here’ situation this BBQ thing but alas that wouldn’t be clickbaity or allow for DISGRACE and EMBARRASMENT would it.",
      "In fact, United have NEVER held a parade for anything other than the Prem or Champions League… even in Fergie time…. MADNESS",
      "PATHETIC attempt at journalism lol…. AGAIN\nMoses",
      "READ: Why Manchester United must sack Amorim, sell Fernandes, appoint Moyes and raid French side",
      "",
      "Glazers have done a fine job\nHow can you say that the Glazers mismanaged their ownership of Man United? In over 20 years, with minimal input by themselves, they have made hundreds of millions of pounds in personal profit. That seems like brilliant management to me. They even managed to sell a debt ridden business with run down assets for more than they paid for it. Again astounding business.",
      "Hell, the shambles that is the football part of the business even managed to win a trophy every couple years. They can take pride in having won more in the last 20 years than the owners of all but 3 clubs in England (assuming City, ‘pool and Chelsea have actually won more).",
      "How dare you say the Glazers, who bought so much footballing pleasure to the ABU crowd over the last 2 decades are guilty of poor management. After all there are many more ABU’s than MU supporters. By any measure personal to the Glazers they have done a brilliant job of managing the club.\nMurray (life long member of the Anyone But United crowd who was saddened when the Glazers left)",
      "(Erm, they haven’t left; they still own more than 70% of the club – Ed)",
      "",
      "Pashun and wages\nFirstly, some people seem to have issues with Liverpool fans proclaiming themselves as special, or the best in the world, while also booing Trent. Whilst I’m not a fan of booing, it’s probably fair to say that far from being mutually exclusive, they probably go hand in hand.",
      "Typically, fans leave an impression not for their chat about ecumenical matters in the pre-Columbine era, but more for making a massive racket in the stadium and knowing a lot about their players. This might also be called passion and knowledge. It’s therefore no surprise when the outliers do then act like jilted lovers when a player leaves.",
      "On another matter, people often redefine their league failures by quoting where they are in the wages league table. Obviously some clubs pay more than others (I’m looking at the republic of Mancunia), but in the main, professional contracts at elite clubs can give up to 100% extra on top of base salary for hitting performance targets, so is that really any justification? It all sounds a bit chicken and egg to me. Or am I missing something?",
      "To put that sentiment more succinctly, Arsenal will be low wage payers this season because they underachieved in most metrics.\nAdam, LFC",
      "",
      "Trent and ‘family’\nFirst things first, I’m an Arsenal fan so I’m more than likely obnoxious. Just gonna say that up front so all the fans of other clubs can decide whether my opinion is worthy of reading. And yes it is about Trent.",
      "Obviously the Liverpool fans booing a man who has played an important role in winning them everything are stupid, classless, ungrateful, all that. And I also understand that fans are allowed to be stupid and classless. It’s not illegal, it doesn’t necessarily point to a problem with anybody’s character. It’s sport.",
      "You’re not a worse person for booing Trent Alexander-Arnold or for being bitter toward him. But you are stupid, classless, and ungrateful. And you probably don’t have anything in your life worth celebrating if you can’t even celebrate this wonderful footballer, and I mean that sincerely.",
      "What disturbs me about the whole thing is the justification that “he’s one of our own so it hurts more.” That if he’s part of the Liverpool “family” then it makes it even more of a betrayal. Honestly I have to wonder how you treat members of your own family if that’s how you think about it. You should want your family to leave home and spend time experiencing the world. Just because of where he’s born he has to compromise his career to make his family happy? “But we didn’t even get a fee!” Let the man have a life.",
      "I have to wonder how players like Van Dijk and Salah must feel when they see how some of these fans react to “one of our own” leaving his hometown to start a new chapter of his life. Some (often abusive) people are far more horrible to their families than the people they work with and see outside the home, so I have to wonder exactly what kind of person has this sentiment.",
      "Again, you can feel however you want. You’re not better or worse than anyone else for booing your own player (the best right back in the history of the Premier League besides Lauren of course). If you want to allow a thug and a bully like Jamie Carragher to dictate how you feel then be my guest. I’m sure plenty of people will be able to point to other clubs who have booed their own players, been horrible, etc. But I’m not talking about them.",
      "What we saw on Sunday was needlessly small and petty behavior directed toward a club legend, and I don’t think players forget things like that. You’ll never walk alone until you do.\nDeadbeat Cat Dad",
      "",
      "Ronaldo Jnr?\nAm I the only person who finds it completely mental that Cristiano Ronaldo has a 15 year old son playing for Portugal’s U15s? I guess Ronaldo still seems to be 25 in my head.",
      "No idea if the kid is good enough to make it to the men’s team, but it would be one to watch if they both played in the same match (would Sr lose his shit and dock his pocket money if Jr didn’t pass to him?)",
      "Has there ever been a father/son combo in an international match before?\nPhil, Manchester",
      "",
      "FA are actually blameless\nFurther from Paul’s mail earlier about officials not flagging offside at the time they see them, and how this could have prevented the nasty injury suffered by Awoniyi.",
      "I totally agree that the current rules/guidance isn’t necessarily correct but it had to be changed to accommodate VAR.",
      "What I don’t agree with is Paul blaming the FA. They don’t decide the rules which officials follow – it’s IFAB who do this.\nA, LFC, Montreal (stuck up for VAR recently, now the FA – something must be up with me!)",
      "",
      "Beckett is an Evertonian\nI just want to respond to Mick T, Liverpool from his comment on Evertonians and relegation. When I lived in Liverpool, I actually became good friends with a bunch of Evertonians (massive Liverpool fan here) and found them 20+ years ago to be better with the banter (Rafael Beneath Us) and all that. But I always looked at Everton as a kind of second team in my books…happy to support them 36 out of 38 games during the season, etc. But there has been a real shift in them (I blame Jordan Pickford), and they are a supremely bitter club…but also delusional (We won 2-2 at Goodison Park).",
      "And so, let Everton wish for relegation before Liverpool wins a title. I wish Everton a perpetual life of 17th place finishes, staying up on the last day forever, never getting relegated, but always that fear. A sporting equivalent of Waiting for Godot.\nJonathan, Toronto",
      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season."

      "Manchester United might need to sack Ruben Amorim, sell Bruno Fernandes, replace Andre Onana and induce a global pandemic to meet their targets next season.",
      "Despite slugging it out with Europa League final opponents Spurs to see who can embarrass themselves the most domestically, 16th-placed Manchester United have set themselves the objective of a top-six finish in 2025/26.",
      "Every Premier League club has been set a target for next season but that seems like one of the more outlandish examples.",
      "Only five times in the history of 20-team Premier League campaigns has a side improved their league position by 10 places from one season to the next. Nottingham Forest will make that a half-dozen soon enough, but what lessons can Manchester United take from the past?",
      "",
      "Aston Villa (from 16th in 2002/03 to 6th in 2003/04) – changed managers\n“I had another year left on my contract and I was under no pressure to resign as Aston Villa manager,” said Graham Taylor. “But I have become increasingly unhappy at how the club as a whole was run,” he added, never naming infamous chairman Doug Ellis but leaving little doubt as to his reasoning either.",
      "Having broken his managerial retirement after nine months at the beck and call of a panicking Villa in February 2002, Taylor should perhaps have consulted predecessor John Gregory about the business practises of his new boss.",
      "But Taylor was lured back to the West Midlands in what he would later state he always knew was a “transitional” role. A record of 19 wins from 60 games saw Villa lurch from 8th one season to 16th in his first and only full campaign, before a jump back up to 6th under his replacement.",
      "David O’Leary had been out of work for a year after leaving trophyless Leeds, but an exciting crop of Villa academy graduates dovetailed wonderfully with the experience of Dion Dublin, Ronny Johnsen, Nolberto Solano and Juan Pablo Angel to turn relegation battlers into European qualification contenders.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Make Ruben Amorim quit; he genuinely doesn’t seem far off anyway.",
      "",
      "Everton (from 17th in 2003/04 to 4th in 2004/05) – sold best player\n“I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better,” was how David Moyes allayed any concerns West Ham might have had over losing prized asset Declan Rice. And frankly it was powerful logic: they avoided relegation by six points with him as their top scorer, Manchester United handed £27m over after Euro 2004 and Everton used those funds to help qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It does skip past a few key points, like the signing of Tim Cahill, the partnership between David Weir and Alan Stubbs and the form of Lee Carsley. But fundamentally Everton improved as a team when they cashed in on their star player.",
      "Only Norwich (3rd in 1992/93) have ever finished higher in the Premier League with a negative goal difference than the Toffees, who scored the same number of goals when finishing 4th as they did to come 17th, while only actually suffering four fewer defeats.",
      "Even when they chucked their new-found transfer weight around it backfired, but without Rooney at least Thomas Gravesen could finally spread his wings.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? Sell Bruno Fernandes, and maybe sign Marcus Bent.",
      "",
      "Fulham (from 17th in 2007/08 to 7th in 2008/09) – signed competent keeper\nIt remains one of the more unlikely relegation escapes in Premier League history, perhaps a little lost in the mire of Derby selfishly and simultaneously recording their Apocalypse Season.",
      "Fulham were already 18th and in trouble when they appointed Roy Hodgson as Lawrie Sanchez’s successor in December 2007. But their struggle to build any momentum left them in this spot heading into the final straight:",
      "The Cottagers then trailed Manchester City 2-0 within 21 minutes of the first of those three must-win games. Yet they did precisely that, Diomansy Kamara capping a ludicrous comeback in stoppage time at the Etihad before Birmingham and Portsmouth were felled for no apparent reason.",
      "Fulham’s eagerness to avoid a similar scenario meant a substantial summer spend, with Andy Johnson, Bobby Zamora, John Paintsil and Zoltan Gera among those signed. But it was free agent Mark Schwarzer, released by Middlesbrough, who rejected Juventus and Bayern Munich to move to west London.",
      "Perhaps a full pre-season of Hodgson’s double training sessions of two banks of four was actually the decisive factor but Fulham went from conceding 60 goals in 2007/08 to letting in only 34 in 2008/09, fewer than Arsenal and indeed every team bar the top three, with Schwarzer equalling a record for most clean sheets in a Premier League season for the Cottagers which still stands.",
      "The lesson for Manchester United? It’s not great news for Andre Onana.",
      "",
      "Leicester (from 14th in 2014/15 to 1st in 2015/16) – changed managers but also signed probably the league’s best player from France’s mid-table\nThere is little point in trying to dilute and replicate any element of Leicester’s title-winning season, but also Manchester United should probably sack Amorim after his son is embroiled in a racist sex tape scandal before appointing a likeable but ill-suited manager, being widely tipped for relegation and capitalising on the collective bed-soiling of the usual contenders.",
      "It might also be an idea to identify one of the most effective players in Premier League history, going entirely unnoticed in Ligue Un at a ludicrously low price. Leicester, unbeknownst to everyone including themselves, already had most of the pieces in place to win the title, but N’Golo Kante, a £5.6m signing from Caen, made director of football Steve Walsh perhaps the sport’s most coveted man.",

      "",
      "West Ham (from 16th in 2019/20 to 6th in 2020/21) – stopped playing in front of fans\nWhile the instinct is to wipe the entire sorry saga from memory, those months in which Jesse Lingard and Tomas Soucek were the single greatest footballers on earth were at least a novelty. A great many things would not have happened without lockdown and West Ham almost qualifying for the Champions League is chief among them.",
      "From the date of the first game without fans in June 2020 to May 2021, when heavy restrictions were still placed on attendance, only five teams accrued more points than West Ham, who trailed Arsenal on goal difference alone.",
      "Considering their plight beforehand it was a ludicrous turnaround. Moyes was again the architect of a huge leap in places but he struggled after replacing Manuel Pellegrini and things only started to click when Michail Antonio was free to chase long balls and run the channels without fear of being chastised by supporters.",

      "18) Marco Verratti (Al-Arabi)\nTwo years might well be enough for a mid-table Qatari side; will he join a really good Qatari side instead?",
      "",
      "17) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",

      "16) Josh Brownhill (Burnley)\nThere are links to a West Ham move that sound like the most West Ham move ever.",

      "15) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, and it looks like it might earn him a move to Strasbourg.",
      "",
      "14) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",

      "2) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool?",

      "Man Utd’s hopes of landing one of their summer transfer targets on a free transfer have taken a serious hit after Fabrizio Romano revealed Bayern Munich are now in pole position.",
      "Utd had grown “increasingly confident” of securing Tah in recent weeks, amid mounting uncertainty over their defensive options.",
      "With Victor Lindelof expected to leave this summer, and ongoing concerns over Matthijs de Ligt’s fitness amid a number of other injuries, defensive reinforcements are a top priority for INEOS this summer.",
      "Defence isn’t the only priority, as the Red Devils are looking to move early in the market to secure their top targets, including Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Tah, 29, is viewed as one of the most experienced and dependable defenders on the market. And with his contract up at the end of the season, he had emerged as a serious candidate for a reshaped Man Utd backline under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Bayern Munich have now made their move.",
      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",
      "Barcelona were also linked earlier this year but are now out of the race. Romano confirmed the Catalan side have no intention of moving for the Germany international, citing their wealth of centre-back options as the reason. “Not because of FFP,” he added, “but because they have many centre-backs.”",
      "Real Madrid, Tah’s current boss Xabi Alonso’s new home, are reportedly focused on other targets. And that leaves Bayern, once again, looking likely to poach a top performer from a direct Bundesliga rival.",
      "It’s a hammer blow to Utd, who were one of the first English clubs to seriously explore the free-agent opportunity and saw Tah as an ideal blend of experience, physicality and leadership.",
      "His 400+ appearances for Leverkusen, capped off by a historic unbeaten title-winning season last term, had put him firmly on the radar of INEOS chiefs.",
      "Tah himself confirmed earlier this year that his decision to leave Leverkusen had already been made.",
      "“Definitely,” he said when asked if he would leave at season’s end.",
      "“I made the decision not to renew my contract and to stick with it. That’s the case now. The club knows about it. Everything has been said from the beginning.”",
      "But there remains a flicker of hope for Utd. If Amorim’s side can secure Champions League football by lifting the Europa League, they could re-enter the frame with a more attractive sporting package.",
      "But for now, Bayern are firmly in control.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Bayer Leverkusen Jonathan Tah on a free transfer as their third summer signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘reached out’ to Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah as they ‘sense an opportunity’.",
      "Man Utd are weighing up whether to attempt to beat Barcelona and other clubs to the free transfer of Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, according to reports.",

      "Six appeal\nWe’ve all enjoyed the idea of Manchester United having the target of a top-six finish next season, with the Mirror quick to point out that teams leaping 10 places in the table from one season to the next is an unusual event managed only five times by anyone in 20-team Premier League seasons – or ‘FIVE times in history’ if you’re an overexcited Reach headline writer.",
      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",
      "So yes, a 10-place jump back into the top six next season seems unlikely and United probably won’t do it. But their own failure to achieve such a thing in over 60 years doesn’t really seem that damning.",

      "Just to tick these all off quickly: the TEN players is in fact ‘eight to 10’ by the time you get to the intro and only ‘five or six’ actually still under contract beyond this season by the time you get to Neville’s actual quote, the FOUR club stars are Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia so, well, yeah, probably right, and the Neville ‘sickly feeling’ reveal is… he thinks only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team. You just told us.",

      "Jurgen Klopp has hailed Xabi Alonso as a ‘standout’ manager as he prepares to take over at Real Madrid. The Spaniard has already confirmed that he will be leaving current side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the summer.",
      "Right, okay, fine. But where’s the snub? He’s going to Real Madrid. That is, if anything, the opposite of a snub.",
      "Of course, we do here have the now-standard tabloid use of the word ‘as’ where instead of the usual dictionary meaning of ‘something that happens during the time when something else is taking place’ it in fact means ‘something that happens at literally any time other than the time when something else is taking place’.",
      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",
      "Yet still we get no nearer to this Real Madrid snub. Until, far later, when we eventually get this.",
      "Ironically, Klopp might have actually talked himself out of contention for the Real Madrid job, with the Spanish side eventually moving for Alonso. It had long been reported that the former Liverpool boss was among their favoured candidates for the role.",
      "So the snub is Real Madrid not giving the job to Jurgen Klopp, a man who expressed no interest in the job and who made it very clear when leaving Liverpool that he would not be returning to a frontline managerial job for some time and quite possibly ever? What a snub. What volumes spoken. What absolute bollocks.",

      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",
      "\"We need to feel that. We need to get angry with the critics and perform. The worst thing we can do is let it go, that is so hard to understand.\""

      "Marcus Rashford's season is over and the Man Utd star faces a big decision over his future after impressing on loan at Aston Villa, who have an option to buy the forward for £40m, with no certainty about his next steps, other than the expectation his future lies away from Old Trafford",
      "Thursday 15 May 2025 23:44, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",
      "It is too close to call with two games to go in the hunt for the top five...",
      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",
      "Competition for places at Barcelona is high in the wide forward positions, with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, two of the favourites for the Ballon d'Or, unlikely to be displaced.",
      "As far as Man Utd are concerned, they are seemingly already pursuing replacements for Rashford, with Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap among their top targets.",
      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
      "Villa face Tottenham and Man Utd in their final two fixtures and sit level on points with Chelsea, ahead of them in the table only on goal difference.",
      "Opta's supercomputer has given them a 38 per cent chance of breaking into the Champions League spots.",
      "\"If Man Utd win the cup [Europa League], they will be celebrating and won't be fussed. If they lose, you'd have to push them out the dressing room to play that game!",
      "\"I see Chelsea winning on Friday Night Football. Then they have to beat Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"The problem is Man City, they could be sixth in the league by the time they play Bournemouth! I expect Chelsea and Villa both to win. City don't play because of the FA Cup final.",
      "\"I don't see Newcastle beating Arsenal away and then they have to beat Everton, a difficult team to play against.",
      "\"Forest need to get a result and win at West Ham or they will finish seventh. It is massively exciting. You wouldn't want to be in it!\""

      "Fresh from a 7/1 winning double, our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his Premier League insight and sees problems for Chelsea on Friday Night Football.",
      "Tottenham going off 7/1 with Sky Bet for the away win tells you all you need to know about their prospects in this fixture. It's the biggest price they've been by a long way vs a non-big six team in the last 10 years.",
      "Even if you added another zero to that 7/1, I'd be tempted to swerve it.",
      "Villa have a goal in sight and have been relentless in their pursuit of a top-five finish, winning seven of their last eight Premier League games. They've crashed the markets and the top five party and are now just 11/10 with Sky Bet to finish there.",
      "Pro-Villa angles are the only betting angles to consider across the props markets and with Jacob Ramsey (suspended) and Youri Tielemans (injured) out for this fixture, backing Boubacar Kamara's shots lines makes appeal based on he could be playing with attacking licence.",
      "He did last weekend in the win at Bournemouth, hitting two shots, which is way above his season per 90 average of 0.44. It's 4/1 with Sky Bet for him to repeat the feat and register two or more shots.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's suspension makes this fixture trickier for Chelsea than the 1/3 odds with Sky Bet imply. Jackson has played his last game of this season following that red card at Newcastle and it leaves Enzo Maresca with a huge issue at centre-forward.",
      "Jackson has missed seven Premier League matches for Chelsea this season, they've lost four of those matches against Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Ipswich, scoring just one goal along the way. A criticism of Maresca this season has been the predictability of Chelsea's play and that is more apparent when you remove Jackson from the equation as he does bring a bit of surprise and directness to what Chelsea are trying to serve up.",
      "Goals could be hard to come by for Maresca's team without their focal point in attack and when you throw in Manchester United's inability to put the ball in the net along with what is lurking on the horizon for them on Wednesday in Bilbao, the goal line set by the markets feels too high.",
      "United have failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton, Everton (both 15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more. Since December 22 they have scored just 21 Premier League goals in their 20 games. The under 2.5 goals line is a big price at 13/8 with Sky Bet considering all the correct scores you get on your side.",
      "Opposing goals in matches at Wembley remains a sustainable long-term betting strategy.",
      "It might be the mecca of English football - to play there is every footballer's dream - but I'm convinced the place saps the momentum out of a game. Maybe the jeopardy of what is at stake plays a part which in turn leads to low-scoring football matches but I think games there rarely spark into life.",
      "The last 46 domestic and European matches played at Wembley, the average goals per 90 stands at 1.98 goals in normal time and if you backed the under 3.5 line in those 45 games, you'd have won 42 times. Yes, the prices on offer for under 3.5 goals are quite tight but a return at that strike rate means you'd be swimming in profit if backing that line blind.",
      "If you back Crystal Palace +1 handicap (double chance) and under 3.5 goals through the RequestABet function with Sky Bet you have a juicy 7/4 shot on your side with Sky Bet.",
      "The Grand Old Lady is set to belt out one final tune and if previous farewell games at stadiums are anything to go by, there should be two things on the menu: a home win and lots of goals.",
      "The final games at Upton Park, Highbury, The Dell, Griffin Park and White Hart Lane all ended with the home team signing off in style with a win and a total of 23 goals scored in those five matches.",
      "Meanwhile, only Sheffield Utd (97 in 23/24) and Swindon (85 in 93/94) have conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League season than Southampton, so Everton couldn't have wished for a more welcoming visitor on goodbye Goodison day.",
      "Everton to win and over 2.5 goals at 11/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play.",
      "The market has got completely carried away with Nottingham Forest here. Just because they need to win, it doesn't always work out like that.",
      "Taking a price as short as 6/4 with Sky Bet on a Forest win makes little sense based on what Nuno Espirito Santo's team has been serving up for the past 12 Premier League games.",
      "Across those 12 games their expected goals against process is working at 1.68 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process. They allowed Leicester to create 1.29 worth of expected goals and score twice, so West Ham with Jarrod Bowen and Mohamed Kudus bringing top quality final third to the table, should be confident of scoring multiple goals.",
      "Bowen has five goals or assists in his last four starts and looks overpriced to grab another one at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brentford don't want the season to end. They've lost just two of their last 12 Premier League games, winning the last four for the first time in the top-flight since 1939.",
      "Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Man City and Arsenal have scored more goals in the league this season (63) with the Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa combination so exciting to watch.",
      "The Bees can sting you from all angles though, including set pieces where the addition of Michael Kayode and his excellent long-throw has given them an extra attacking dimension. Sepp van den Berg is the beneficiary of these clever set pieces and he's had eight shots from his last 10 starts when playing centre-back. He is 8/11 with Sky Bet for another shot.",
      "Sometimes the narrative is just too powerful to ignore.",
      "Jamie Vardy will make his 500th and final appearance for Leicester here and will not feature in the season finale at Liverpool next Sunday to allow him a King Power Stadium farewell.",
      "He will be celebrated before and after kick-off as the club finish their home campaign in a battle between two already relegated clubs.",
      "With nothing on the line this could turn into a bit of Vardy sideshow and he is no stranger to grabbing the limelight. He is searching for his 200th goal for Leicester too. His 5/4 anytime goalscorer price is an obvious starting point but boosting it up by taking the 4/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring the last goal of the game makes sense.",
      "Some things are just meant to be.",
      "The draw at 5/2 with Sky Bet must be of interest based on it suiting both teams. If this rolls past 70 minutes with the scores level we could get a drifty end that peters out.",
      "Newcastle know a point will be just fine for their prospects as they'd have Champions League qualification firmly in their hands heading into the final day knowing a win over Everton at home would secure a top-five finish.",
      "Meanwhile, you get the feeling Mikel Arteta and his boys just want the season to end now. Arsenal have dropped 18 points in their last 11 Premier League games, winning just three times and have been beaten by the Toon on three occasions already this season. A draw is fine for them in terms of finishing second with only Southampton to come for them.",
      "Taking a view on player cards in end-of-season games isn't an ideal punting strategy but we've got a full-back here who is in an aggressive mood.",
      "Conor Bradley is a man looking to take his chance following Trent Alexander-Arnold's decision to move on and his ability to play calm and composed isn't going to be helped by the transfer move for Jeremie Frimpong. Bradley does still look quite reckless and raw at times, making five fouls and being carded on both in his last two starts. He's 5/2 with Sky Bet to pick up another booking.",

      "The United boss warned that everyone at the club must \"seriously think about a lot of things\" before saying they should \"give space to other people\" if the poor form continues after the summer.",
      "But Amorim insisted in his press conference ahead of next Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham that he has no plans to step down.",
      "Asked if he would seriously resign, Amorim said: \"I am far from quitting.\"",

      "Amorim, who acknowledged it is \"hard to manage things\" at United, said the cut-backs made it difficult for the club to pay for those staff still in a job.",

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

If they lose both their remaining league games they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",

      "Arsenal had two of their biggest tests of the season this week and how they close the gap to those two teams cannot be clearer now.",
      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
