      "It marked the first occasion United had managed consecutive Premier League wins since boss Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford in November 2024. Sunday's crucial three points on Merseyside have lifted Amorim's team to ninth in the Premier League standings – just two points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.",
      "There will now be optimism at Old Trafford that their triumph over reigning English champions Liverpool can spark what has been a challenging reign under Amorim so far. And Neville has expressed his belief that a return to Europe remains achievable for United's players this campaign - proposing that a top six finish should be the objective at M16.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" he told The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them.",
      "\"And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Neville reckons United must carry Sunday's stunning triumph into their next fixture - a home encounter with Brighton and Hove Albion next Saturday.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" he said. \"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",

      "Roy Keane has launched a damning assessment on Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk following his lacklustre performance in Sunday's defeat against Manchester United.",
      "Arne Slot's team suffered their fourth consecutive loss, falling 2-1 at home to a resurgent United side. Harry Maguire netted a late winner for Ruben Amorim's squad after Cody Gakpo had levelled the score, negating Bryan Mbeumo's first-half opener.",
      "In his post-match analysis, ex-United midfielder Keane singled out Van Dijk's performance, criticising the Netherlands international and suggesting he should shoulder more responsibility for his team's recent dip in form.",
      "Van Dijk was found wanting in the lead up to Mbeumo's opening goal and struggled throughout the match, with Ibrahima Konate outshining him among Liverpool's central defenders.",
      "\"Particularly as a big leader of the team. A couple of years ago we talked about United parking the bus here and we were critical. Now they've scored two today and two last year and you're the centre half.",
      "\"Always start with the man in the mirror. Van Dijk, if you're the centre half and your team are all of a sudden giving up loads of goals, and you've got new people coming to your club, you've got to have a good look at yourself and think 'am I really helping people?'\".",
      "Van Dijk, in his post-match interview, lamented Liverpool's latest defeat, confessing that they failed to capitalise on their chances and were \"far too rushed\" when it came to scoring.",
      "\"I think we conceded a very sloppy second goal. We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost,\" he said.",

      "Ruben Amorim was unhappy with a lack of 'composure' from his Manchester United players in the second half of their stunning 2-1 win against Liverpool - but hailed the Red Devils' 'spirit'.",
      "United led after just two minutes at Anfield, as Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock with a controversial goal. Amorim's side held on until the 78th minute, as Cody Gakpo equalised for Liverpool. However, United hit back through Harry Maguire, whose late header snatched all three points.",
      "It was the Red Devils' first win at Anfield in 10 visits, a struggle stretching back to 2016, six managers ago. Amorim claimed that it was his 'biggest win' since becoming United manager nearly a year ago, as they toppled their arch enemies and the reigning Premier League champions, who have now lost their last four games.",
      "\"We fought for every ball, we lost our composure in the second half but the spirit was there and that is the most important thing, if you have the spirit you can win any game. It was a good day and now I am concerned about Brighton.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Amorim went on to say: \"We just saw the game and knew how important our set pieces are and the guys that have more experiences are on in the beginning. Every time we play in this environment well if you block well in the beginning you can feel the defence turning and we feel that in our stadium and all the big teams feel that.",
      "\"A good win. It will give us more confidence through the week and pleasure to our fans, they deserve it and that is in our hands. This is in the past, now it's time to look at the future.\"",
      "Will this be a turning point for Ruben Amorim at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "The late victory also saw Amorim pick up back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time, a long-awaited feat. \"Every day is special [as United boss] but this was a very special win,\" the Portuguese added in his press conference.",
      "\"To see our fans singing during the game, in a moment that the biggest rival are champions, on their field and at their stadium, this win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team because I believe we can play so much better.",
      "\"We will analyse the game in the same way we analyse the other ones, try to see the good things and bad things. But, for me, the togetherness they [the players] showed during this game, that is special for me.\"",

      "Milos Kerkez was branded \"a nervous wreck\" by Jamie Redknapp during Liverpool's 2-1 loss to Manchester United as the Hungary international's struggles continued on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Kerkez was one of Bournemouth's most consistent and impressive Premier League performers last season, form which earned him a £45million summer move to Anfield. But the 21-year-old has struggled to replicate those displays in a Liverpool shirt and looked a shadow of the player who caught the eye on the south coast as United condemned the Premier League champions to a fourth straight defeat.",
      "Jamie Redknapp said: “Kerkez is very nervous. He’s like a nervous wreck out there. I feel for him.",
      "“It’s almost a bit too much for him. The game is happening a bit too fast and Diallo is causing him problems. Like you’ve mentioned, with Mbeumo and Cunha they’ve gone for a different approach with a bit more pace.”",
      "Kerkez was touted as a target for months before the summer transfer window opened with Liverpool in need of competition for Andy Robertson. The youngster has been criticised on more than one occasion, though, since joining the champions.",
      "After struggling in Liverpool's defeat against Chelsea prior to the international break, Kerkez was likened to a youth team player by Gary Neville, who expressed concerns after watching him lose duels that he felt the defender should be winning.",
      "\"The boy Kerkez, to be honest with you, at this point in time, he looks like a youth-team player,\" he said on The Gary Neville Podcast. \"I know he's a good player, but he looks like he's playing for the youth team, or the Under-21s.",
      "\"He looks so naïve; he looks like a baby out there. He's losing 50-50s with Neto!\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"He's had Premier League experience, it's not like he's come in from another country,\" Neville continued. \"He's got a lot of games under his belt, he's played at these grounds before, so I expected him to slot in.",
      "\"One, he's playing alongside Virgil Van Dijk, the best centre half in the world, so if you want to play in a back four, you want to play with great defenders and he is doing.",
      "\"And he's got players who work hard on that side, it's not like he's playing on the right with Salah in front of him, which is always a bit more difficult because you always get a little bit more exposed.",
      "\"But I have to say from the first ten minutes of that game against Bournemouth on the first game of the season, he's struggled.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United took a surprise lead inside 63 seconds, as Bryan Mbeumo slotted home. But Liverpool were furious that Oliver hadn't blown his whistle, as Alexis Mac Allister was down after suffering a blow to the back of his head in a clash with his own team-mate, Virgil van Dijk. Oliver didn't appear to see the Liverpool star holding his head on the turf, allowing play to continue.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre explained that because Van Dijk made the contact with Mac Allister, it couldn't have been given as a foul and VAR were unable to intervene. It was, therefore, down to Oliver's reading of the game.",

The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "The last place Ruben Amorim probably expected to banish his most unwanted record was Anfield.",
      "But, sure enough, it says everything about the current state of Liverpool’s form that Amorim finally won back-to-back Premier League games 11 months into his reign as Manchester United manager. Incredibly, Liverpool have now lost four games in a row for the first time since November 2014 and the alarm bells are ringing loud and clear for Arne Slot.",
      "Liverpool, the reigning champions, are just not right. They are just not clicking and, despite such a promising start, their raft of new signings do not look like a team.",
      "Slot’s defence looked wide open and Harry Maguire was given so much space to head home the dramatic 84th minute winner. Maguire had been an absolute rock at the heart of United’s defence all afternoon and no-one deserved it more than him. Maguire ran over to the away end, spread his arms open wide and just breathed in the moment in pure celebration.",
      "Let’s be clear: Liverpool wasted so many chances. They will be kicking themselves. But United fought so hard and victories are rarely sweeter than against their great rivals.",
      "And the manner of victory probably made it even sweeter because United had led so long through Bryan Mbeumo’s controversial opener, Cody Gakpo equalised with 12 minutes left and normally, from there, Liverpool kick on and win games.",
      "But this feels like a long way from last season. Alexander Isak was subbed again and the £125m striker looks a long way off. Milos Kerkez is another new boy who is struggling. They are just not on the same wavelength.",
      "United, meanwhile, fought, scrapped and no wonder the away end was jubilant at the final whistle. The army of white United shirts went to the away end and celebrated an incredible moment.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "They still look a long way from the finished article but Mbeumo scored, Matheus Cunha was sensational, tenacious and so dangerous. Maguire led the United rearguard; they appear to have found themselves a proper keeper in Senne Lammens.",
      "You have to admire the way United fans have never given up singing Amorim’s name and how he is going to fix their club. Well, wins like these will live long in the memory.",
      "It all started after just one minute. Virgil van Dijk caught Alexis Mac Allister with an elbow in the back of the head, the Liverpool midfielder crashed to the floor and United just played on. Bruno Fernandes swept the ball wide to Amad Diallo and his slick pass played in Bryan Mbeumo whose shot almost went through Liverpool keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "Liverpool were fuming and claimed play should have been stopped because of a head injury. VAR could not intervene as it was not a foul. But the ball was in the net within three seconds of the Mac Allister injury. It was referee Michael Oliver’s call and he did not stop it.",
      "United could have actually gone further ahead but Fernandes hit the outside of the post. Gakpo hit the post an incredible three times. Liverpool had so many missed chances.",
      "Slot rang the changes. Hugo Ekitike was lively and Federico Chiesa always makes a difference. It was Chiesa’s low cross and Gakpo smashed it in to level it up. Six minutes later, Fernandes’ cross found Maguire at the back post and he headed in. Still there was more drama as Gakpo missed an absolute sitter as he planted a header wide of the target.",

      "Manchester United ended their nine-year wait for a victory at Anfield thanks Harry Maguire's late winner. Bryan Mbeumo's early goal was cancelled out by Liverpool star Cody Gakpo's strike, only for Maguire to head home in the dying embers and give Ruben Amorim back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time.",
      "It was a stunning start from United, as Mbeumo put them in the lead after just 63 seconds. The forward was played through by Amad, with Bruno Fernandes having picked up a loose ball in midfield.",
      "Mbeumo slotted under Giorgi Mamardashvili and made it 1-0 in front of the Kop. The Red Devils nearly doubled their lead when Fernandes hit the post after good work from Matheus Cunha.",
      "The second half was more nip and tuck. Amorim rang in the changes, as his side attempted to become the first United team to win at Anfield since 2016 - 10 meetings and six managers ago - and Maguire's header from a superb volleyed pass by Fernandes clinched it.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Senne Lammens 7.5 - Made a crucial save to deny Alexander Isak. Looks confident.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt 6.5 - Having his best spell since joining the Red Devils but couldn't block Gakpo - who Maguire was initially marking - from scoring.",
      "Harry Maguire 7 - Largely robust but was dragged out of position for Gakpo's goal. Then popped up with a huge moment.",
      "Luke Shaw 6 - Kept Mo Salah largely quiet.",
      "Amad 7 - A lovely assist and plenty of defensive duties afterwards. Unfortunate with his yellow card after a good sliding tackle.",
      "Casemiro 6 - Rightly booked for a foul on Salah. Subbed off with Amad before the hour mark.",
      "Bruno Fernandes 8 - Lively from minute one, although he should've scored in the first half. His assist was excellent.",
      "Diogo Dalot 6 - Vulnerable at times but helped Shaw enough. Admittedly playing on his wrong side.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo 8 - Took his goal with ice in his veins. Dispossessed for the equaliser.",
      "Matheus Cunha 6.5 - Hassled and did excellently to set Fernandes up for his chance.",

      "Harry Maguire deepened the sense of gloom around Liverpool as Manchester United condemned the reigning champions to a fourth straight defeat in all competitions.",
      "Defender Maguire headed home the winner from a Bruno Fernandes cross six minutes from the end of a frenetic game at Anfield, as United won at the home of their rivals for the first time since 2016.",
      "United took the lead after just 63 seconds as the hosts, who had wanted the game stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, allowed Bryan Mbeumo to run in behind their defence and beat Giorgi Mamardashvili with ease.",
      "A rattled Liverpool often struggled to find cohesion after such an early blow, but Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork twice before Fernandes shaved the post at the other end as United pressed for a second.",
      "Liverpool would turn the screw in the second half though, and after Gakpo hit the post again and Mo Salah missed a glorious chance, substitute Federico Chiesa crossed for Gakpo to turn home from close range.",
      "That had seemed set to start a Liverpool onslaught, but Fernandes crossed for Maguire to plant home a header in front of the delirious travelling fans. Here are the game's main talking points.",
      "It was never going to be quiet, but we didn't expect it to be quite so loud quite so soon. Less than a minute was on the clock when Virgil van Dijk, Mbeumo and Mac Allister all went up together, with the Argentina international clearly coming off the worst.",
      "Liverpool's No.10 was still prone on the turf as Amad Diallo played the ball forward towards a roaming Mbeumo, and there did appear to a moment Van Dijk expected the game to halt as you'd usually expect in this situation. But it didn't.",
      "Mbeumo ran on and tucked his shot past Mamardashvili, who should have done better, and United were free to celebrate a goal that verged on the bizarre.",
      "Were Liverpool guilty of not playing, or fully concentrating, to the whistle? Perhaps, but it wasn't as if they had safe possession when Mac Allister - who would need a scrum cap after treatment - had received the blow from his captain. Games usually stop in those circumstances.",
      "We know what the formation will be obviously, but who is playing in the positions can make all the difference. Ruben Amorim's famed 3-4-3 here included Amad at right wing-back and Fernandes getting forward whenever he could from midfield.",
      "Against a disjointed Liverpool in the first half, it worked. Yes they were fortunate not to concede - particularly to the flowing move which ended with Gakpo hitting the post, something he then did again with a cross that was deflected.",
      "It was clear that Amorim had, rightly decided to target Liverpool left-back Milos Kerkez through Amad and Mbeumo, and United could easily have grabbed a second goal when they were on top, with Fernandes going closest when he shaved the post.",
      "Liverpool weren't functioning as well as we know they can do in attack, but it is also true to say that they were very unlucky in front of goal. Gakpo in particular was incredibly luckless, hitting the post three times by the start of the second half, before his goal and then a shocking miss late on.",
      "The third shot against the woodwork, a wonderful effort on the turn, seemed to act as the trigger for an attacking onslaught in the second half, with the Reds picking it up a gear and pushing an increasingly passive United side back.",
      "That led to a huge call from Arne Slot as he introduced Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike while leaving Mo Salah, Alexander Isak and Gakpo on the pitch. He was going for broke. It didn't work. He would later take Isak and Salah off after another disappointing outing for both.",
      "United might have struggled to get a foothold as an attacking force while Liverpool turned the screw, but one player who didn't shirk anything was Matheus Cunha.",
      "After starting as the central attacker, the Brazilian held the ball up well and at one point it was appearing to stick to him. He then dropped deeper with the introduction of Benjamin Sesko for Mason Mount, and he was involved in everything United did well from there too. He looks exactly the type of signing the club needed.",
      "So that's four defeats in a row for Liverpool, and this would have been the most painful.",
      "The Reds' season is danger of unravelling after his latest loss, and not only because it has come to their biggest rivals.",
      "Cracks could have been papered over with a point here, but there is a vulnerability about the champions that teams are exploiting on a regular basis, and United did that with aplomb here.",
      "This result could act as a lift-off moment for Amorim and his side, who rode their luck at times but turned in the kid of committed display that has so often been lacking.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "“This is alright, isn’t it? Wow! The last time I was here it was 7-0,” he said in a clip posted on Liverpool’s X page. But when asked for a prediction, Horan replied “I don’t want to say anything. I refuse to speak.”",

      "It has been revealed why Liverpool were denied a penalty during the first half of their clash against Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. A quarter of an hour or so after Bryan Mbeumo put the visitors ahead, Arne Slot's side called for a spot-kick.",
      "Cody Gakpo cut inside off the left wing and delivered a cross into the box, but, before his pass could find its intended target, the ball struck the arm of Amad. The United winger stopped the ball from heading down the corridor of uncertainty, and it was gathered by Senne Lammens.",
      "The Liverpool players immediately called for a penalty, throwing their arms up in the air in protest. Meanwhile, Amad pleaded his innocence to Michael Oliver, who didn't point to the spot.",
      "The incident was briefly checked by the Video Assistant Referee, Darren England, and his assistant, James Bell, at Stockley Park, but they chose to stick with the on-field decision.",

      "\"Then the rest, we have talent to win games, but we need to be aggressive. We need to be different to what we showed against Manchester City, for example.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock gave his verdict on the controversy on BBC Radio 5 Live, saying: \"There's a bit of contention about this goal among the Liverpool fans, they think that there's a head injury in midfield. Van Dijk and Mbeumo went up for the header, they clashed with Mac Allister and he is being treated by the physios.",
      "\"Mbeumo got up from it and made a lovely run in behind, Van Dijk switches off, Konate can't get there and he lifts it over the top of the keeper. Brilliant start for Manchester United.\"",

      "Roy Keane has expressed doubts over whether Ruben Amorim will be granted three years at Manchester United. United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe voiced his backing for the 40-year-old head coach in an interview during the international break.",
      "Ratcliffe pointed to Arsenal's Mikel Arteta as a template and believes Amorim warrants time to demonstrate his credentials at Old Trafford. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" Ratcliffe told The Business podcast.",
      "When questioned whether Amorim would receive three years backing, Ratcliffe responded: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over those first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently addressed Ratcliffe's remarks during his pre-match press conference on Friday, confirming he feels completely supported by United's management behind the scenes. Now, United legend Keane has offered his perspective on the matter - and confessed he remains unconvinced Amorim will receive sufficient time to orchestrate a turnaround should results and displays fail to improve.",
      "\"Whether he will get three years to play with depends how they do over the next few months. They have picked up a little bit - with the new attacking players they look more of a goal threat.",
      "\"But the big test is games like today. Are they going to show their quality or are they going to grind a result out? There are still question marks away from home. Yeah, they have picked up, but coming to Liverpool is a huge test and there are still huge questions marks over this group.\"",
      "United travel to Liverpool on Sunday afternoon hoping to secure back-to-back victories for the first time this campaign following their 2-0 triumph over Sunderland before the international break.",

      "But the striker wasn't named in Amorim's starting line-up. Sesko was replaced by fellow summer signing Matheus Cunha, who's yet to score a goal for the Red Devils since his £62.5m move from Wolves but offers a certain 'characteristic'.",
      "\"I think [Ibrahim] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk likes the confrontation in the air. So we'll try to give them different things to try to win the game.\"",

      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Plenty of United fans didn't agree with the decision, voicing their dismay on social media. \"Why has he benched Sesko? Amorim is so clueless it's unreal,\" one bemoaned.",
      "\"Benching Sesko should be a criminal offence,\" another fumed. \"Ah nice let's bench the striker who's got two in two,\" a third supporter added.",
      "Slot also left a big-money signing on the bench in Florian Wirtz. The German previously missed out on Liverpool's XI for their 2-1 away loss against Chelsea before the international break but came on as a half-time substitute.",
      "What's your score prediction? Let us know in the comments section.",
      "United haven't beaten Liverpool away from home in 10 attempts since 2016, six managers ago. Amorim hopes that his players can replicate the kind of performance that earned them a hard-fought 2-2 draw at Anfield in January.",
      "\"We showed last year. And I think the way we start the game is more important than the environment,\" the Red Devils boss said at his press conference on Friday. \"The environment can change. Of course, they will win a corner, an opportunity.",
      "\"The environment is going to be loud, but we are ready to play with that. And if you looked last year, not this year, but last year, sometimes we play better in that kind of environment than the pressure at home.",
      "\"So, we never know what is going to happen. It's really important to start the game well, to do a really good warm-up, to have a feeling, to understand that it's going to be tough in the first moments. So, I think - I know - they are ready, but we need to prepare for the impact, especially for the beginning of the game.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has revealed the reason behind why he did not open up on his late wife's devastating battle with cancer.",
      "Ferdinand's first wife, Rebecca, died from cancer at the age of 34 in 2015. She had been first diagnosed with the illness in 2014, but kept it private while receiving treatment.",
      "However, after getting the all-clear, the cancer returned and spread to her bones. And just five weeks after she was told by doctors that her condition was terminal, Rebecca tragically passed away.",
      "Ferdinand did not speak to his former or current teammates at United about the issue at the time.",
      "But now, a decade on from his tragic loss, Ferdinand has revealed a conversation he had with Wayne Rooney when the pair were going through personal struggles they had gone through.",
      "Speaking to The Times, Ferdinand said: \"It's built in, in men, not to talk.\"",
      "Ferdinand is hoping to change the stigma around men's mental health by providing a 'safe space' for people to talk about their issues on his Rio Meets podcast on YouTube.",
      "Rooney admitted he does regret not talking to Ferdinand about his issue during an appearance on the podcast earlier in 2025, saying: \"Not just me, but the other players are thinking, why didn't we do more to allow you to come and talk to us?\" Rooney even added that he believes he \"would be dead\" without his wife Coleen.",
      "Ferdinand said of that conversation: \"I was like, 'Wow, I didn't anticipate any of that coming'. We were just fortunate Wayne felt comfortable enough to be so open. I've seen Wayne in low situations.",
      "\"We lived and shared and breathed a life of football together, so I'm going to see things other people haven't, but I never knew about a lot of the things he told me.\"",
      "Ferdinand is, however, glad that progress has been made that players have more space to talk about their own mental health battles, claiming that it was something his generation didn't have.",
      "He is also pleased his two sons Lorenz, 19, and Tate, 17 - who are both in the Brighton academy - would be open to speak about any issues they might have.",
      "As well as speaking to Rooney, Ferdinand reflected on the chats he had with Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen on his podcast due to how open people are now, compared to the dressing room environment he was used to.",
      "This is a modal windoWe were just fortunate Wayne felt comfortable enough to be so open. I’ve seen Wayne in low situations. We lived and shared and breathed a life of football together, so I’m going to see things other people haven’t, but I never knew about a lot of the things he told me.”",
      "Ferdinand said: \"The thing I say to all footballers, past and present, is we've now got the best opportunity to shape the narrative. This is the best era. My generation never had this.",
      "\"We could never have come to the media and said, 'I'm feeling really low, I might need a couple of months off because of depression. I have certain things going on at home. I'm having problems with drink.'",
      "\"There'd have been huge headlines and people would have just gone 'what?' We'd have been hammered. But I'd love to have seen what it would have added to our teams. If we'd been able to be a bit more open and talk about these types of things, I genuinely believe it would have helped.",

      "\"I don't think we would have been allowed [to express our struggles]. People would have put negative slants on our names, our whole personae would have been different.",
      "\"You've got to look at someone like Wayne Rooney. Or Steven. These are gunslingers. Roy of the Rovers types who can drag a 20-man squad out of the mire. How would that have been allowed if they were looked at as a bit of a 'weak touch' in terms of mental capacity and whatnot back then?\"",

      "Despite being a pivotal figure in the squad since his arrival from Sporting CP, uncertainty looms. German champions Bayern are eyeing up a swoop for Fernandes, with United slapping a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "United are open to entertaining bids for any player in their squad if the offer is right, following a colossal £236 million summer transfer splurge. Ruben Amorim was backed in the transfer market with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arriving at Old Trafford.",

      "\"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" he said. \"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",

      "Both sides pushed for a winner and it was United who came out on top as Harry Maguire restored their lead in the closing stages.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Anfield:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Was playing the biggest game of his career at 23 and wasn't intimidated by the Anfield atmosphere. He built on his confident debut and released pressure by sending goal kicks long. 8",
      "Matthijs De Ligt",
      "Got his head onto everything in the first half. He is the only United player to play every single minute in the Premier League this season and he showed why at Anfield. 8",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Amorim started Maguire because of his \"experience\" in big games and his ability to deal with crosses. Maguire didn't let his manager down on his recall to the starting XI. 9",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Although there have been question marks about Luke Shaw this season, he expertly marshalled Liverpool's £125million signing Alexander Isak and showed his composure at some crucial moments. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Unplayable at times in the first half and struck fear into Milos Kerkez whenever he got on the ball. Provided the assist for the opening goal and should have recorded another when Bruno Fernandes hit the post. 8",
      "Casemiro",
      "Casemiro was not expected to start after playing 90 minutes twice for Brazil during the international break, but he demonstrated why he has become one of the most important players in the dressing room again. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "There have been questions about Fernandes' suitability to the deeper midfield role, but he performed at Anfield again. He started the move for Mbeumo's goal and captained United to a first win at Anfield since 2016. 8",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Was the weakest performer in a white shirt in an excellent first 45 minutes for the team. The full-back was still on the winning side. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo calmly celebrated in front of the Kop after firing United into the lead just two minutes into the contest. Constantly looked dangerous when combining with Amad down the right. 9",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Recalled to the team after moving to the bench against Sunderland. Some questioned Cunha's work rate during his time at Wolves, but there was no sign of a reluctance to run at Anfield. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Always works hard for his teammates. Mount worked tirelessly again and received warm applause when he was substituted in the 61st minute. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Saw the game out well after replacing Casemiro. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Made a good challenge after being introduced to a raucous Anfield. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Showed his skill and gave United a focal point in the closing stages. 7",

      "\"Scousers rule the country, like we've always done before,\" read the banner unfurled in the Kop before the game. Bryan Mbeumo was celebrating in front of Liverpool's famous stand just a few minutes later. Mbeumo gestured with his arms, as if to say, 'Are you not entertained?'.",
      "Ruben Amorim had not won back-to-back league games before visiting Anfield on Sunday, but Manchester United won against Liverpool to get that monkey off Amorim's back in remarkable fashion.",
      "Amorim has been under immense pressure this season, yet he became the first United manager since Louis van Gaal in January 2016 to oversee a victory away at Anfield. The win could be a tenure-defining result.",
      "United's head coach made the decision to name Benjamin Sesko on the bench and revert to the striker-less front three he selected for the opening three games of the Premier League season.",
      "Sesko had scored twice in his last two matches. The 6ft 5in striker was the focal point against Sunderland, which was key to the direct approach, but Amorim preferred a more industrious front line at Anfield.",
      "The concerns that United could be toothless were made to look stupid almost immediately after kick-off. Amorim needed to get his team selection right to give United a chance of winning against Liverpool, and another big decision was starting Amad at right wing-back, despite his defensive vulnerabilities.",
      "Amad looked capable of making something happen every time he touched the ball. His pass to assist Mbeumo was perfectly weighted and a shaky Milos Kerkez could not deal with his runs forward.",
      "Liverpool chiefs will be wondering if they can find the receipt for Kerkez. Amad made him look silly and the away section roared whenever he was picked out by a teammate.",
      "Lammens was booed by the Anfield Road Stand when he emerged to warm up. The 23-year-old was excellent against Sunderland, but starting at a raucous Anfield represented the biggest challenge of his career.",
      "The Belgian sent his goal kicks long each time, despite the lack of a focal point, which helped to release the pressure. There was a sense of expectation from the terraces when Alexander Isak was played through into the box in the first half, but Lammens was equal to the effort and saved with his feet.",
      "Casemiro played 90 minutes twice for Brazil during the international break and started at Anfield. His experience was invaluable and he was jeered when he prevented Liverpool from taking a quick free-kick.",
      "Fernandes sent a shot into the Kop after another intelligent pass from Amad and put his hands on his head, understanding that the opportunity he had missed could have consequences. It didn't.",
      "\"We'll still win - a last-minute winner,\" said a Liverpool steward in the media room during the interval. There was a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley, but their luck ran out during defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork at different ends of the ground. You need quality and a touch of fortune to leave Anfield with a victory, and there were signs that hinted United could seal three points on the red side of Merseyside for the first time in nine years, including when Mohamed Salah missed from close range.",
      "Casemiro was serenaded by United's fans when he picked up a card for a professional foul. Amorim replaced Casemiro with Manuel Ugarte and the 33-year-old was congratulated by staff as he left the pitch.",
      "United rode their luck at times and Liverpool showed the type of determination that saw them crowned champions by equalising, finally finding a late breakthrough.",
      "But there was one final twist. There will be chants created about Harry Maguire's winner at Anfield. Maguire slid on his knees and United staff mobbed each other on the touchline.",
      "Liverpool considered hiring Amorim as Jurgen Klopp’s successor but were said to hold reservations over his fixation with his formation. Slot won the league title in his first season and Amorim oversaw a 15th-placed finish at United.",
      "Amorim admitted his side could not build momentum after the Sunderland victory. It was bound to be a challenge to win back-to-back league games for the first time against Liverpool - but United did it.",
      "Liverpool have form for getting United managers the sack. Erik ten Hag was backed to succeed by United chiefs before losing 3-0 to Liverpool at Old Trafford - and he was axed just 57 days later.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery 28 days after losing 5-0 to Liverpool at Old Trafford, while Jose Mourinho was sacked just two days after losing to Liverpool.",
      "Amorim has insisted that United have improved this season, but there has been a lack of evidence to back up his argument until now. Amorim will not be the next United boss to be sacked after Liverpool.",
      "The 40-year-old might turn the Reds around after all.",

[Matheus] Cunha in the middle, if we put Ben [Sesko], it is easier for this kind of centre-backs to control our striker. This kind of game when we win, the coach is so smart and when we lose the problem is the manager.\"",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire insists the win over Liverpool is \"definitely not\" just three points as United beat their old rivals at Anfield for the first time since 2016.",
      "The Reds got off to the best possible start at Anfield as Amad's through ball caught Liverpool sleeping and Bryan Mbeumo fired past Giorgi Mamardashvili. The hosts searched for an equaliser but were left frustrated as Cody Gakpo hit the post three times.",
      "Gakpo's luck eventually changed in the second half. He was on hand in the centre to tap home from close range and leave Senne Lammens with no chance to make it 1-1.",
      "Entering the final ten minutes, the momentum appeared to be with the hosts but Anfield was silenced late on. After a corner was recycled, Bruno Fernandes clipped a cross to the back stick where Maguire was lurking to rise highest and send the away end wild.",
      "\"It has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points. It is the old cliché that it is only three points but it is definitely not, it means a lot more than that to the boys, the club, the fans.",
      "\"I have been here for seven years now and coming to this ground every time and not get three points has been tough. It is for the fans and I hope they have a great night tonight because of course it is only three points on the table, but to come here and get it over Liverpool, as they have been a top team over the years and they have been a lot better than us in recent years so it is good to get one over them.",
      "\"Football is all about memories and creating special memories and I am sure all the fans will have a memory that they will never forget. We will all go home happy.",
      "\"We won’t get carried away because we know this club is not in a position to get carried away. We need to use this as motivation to reach levels that they have reached in recent years because that is where this club should be at.\"",
      "Looking ahead to the visit of Brighton next week, Maguire added: \"Funnily enough in this club it will mean a lot this week but then we have Brighton at home next Saturday. Every game gets treated the same at this club.",

There will now be hope at Old Trafford that their victory over reigning English champions Liverpool can kick-start what has been a difficult tenure so far under Amorim.",
      "And Neville has shared his view that European football is within reach of United's squad this term - suggesting that a top six finish should be the target at M16.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" he told the Gary Neville Podcast.",

      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",

      "Scott McTominay has shown his true colours following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The Napoli midfielder has congratulated Harry Maguire on the victory at Anfield, sending him a classy message on social media.",
      "Shortly after the clash, the United vice-captain marked the occasion with a celebratory post on Instagram, which eclipsed 150,000 likes in under an hour. Captioning a selection of pictures from the game, Maguire wrote: \"I love this club [red heart emoji.\"",
      "Among the thousands of fans who flooded the comment section, McTominay left a message for his former teammate. The Scotland international, who Napoli signed from United in August 2024 for £25m, posted a clapping hands and red heart emoji.",
      "His comment under Maguire's post was 'liked' more than any other, including tributes from Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Patrick Dorgu. Mason Greenwood was among the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Lisandro Martinez who 'liked' what the England international uploaded.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror in July 2025, McTominay claimed he doesn't harbour any ill feelings towards his former club. He said: \"I always want the absolute best for Manchester United.",
      "\"It’s been my life for 22, 23 years so for me, I wish the club all the success in the world. I’m with them every step of the way. I want them to do well. I’m not someone who doesn’t want that.\"",
      "McTominay fired Napoli to the Scudetto last season, scoring 12 goals and providing six assists. The Scot also bagged the player of the season trophy – an award previously won by the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Zinedine Zidane.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",
      "United raised eyebrows when they sanctioned McTominay's departure, with Benni McCarthy describing the deal as 'one of the biggest mistakes in football'. The former Reds coach said: \"There are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes.",
      "\"When they go, the profit lets you sign more players. Having said that, it was one of the biggest mistakes in football to let him leave. He was born to play for United.",
      "\"Maybe he wasn’t the most technical, but he had fight, and I think it’s what they will get back with Matheus Cunha. Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be.",
      "\"To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision. For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club.",
      "\"People can say what they like but we tried to bring in great players that would fit. I know the manager always takes the blame, but sometimes the club needs to look at itself.\"",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was another vocal critic of the move. Speaking to the BBC, the former United boss said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100 per cent. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",

Sunday's 2-1 victory also marked the first time United have secured consecutive wins under Ruben Amorim in the Premier League, following their win over Sunderland before the international break.",
      "The Reds will now be hoping that this first win against their bitter rivals in nearly 10 years can spark a resurgence under Ruben Amorim, who has been under immense scrutiny this season. Sunday's victory has propelled them to ninth place in the league table - just two points shy of fourth-placed Liverpool.",

The Daily Mail claim that United are one of several high-profile clubs 'tracking' the young star, who has one goal and an assist to his name for the club's U21 side.",
      "Asked about the teenager in his post-match press conference following Coventry's 2-0 win over Blackburn on Saturday, Lampard told CoventryLive: “He’s been training with us, on and off, a lot, and he’s training great.",

      "“He’s been playing on the right wing a little bit for us in the 21s at the minute but he can play as a ten. There’s a bit of an eight/ten there so he’s a very versatile attacking player and he’s a kid. And he deserves his chance on the bench because of how he’s trained.”",
      "Lampard added: “He needs to continue but it was a nice little story to get him on there. And it’s not just a gift because the way he’s training and with our squad size, he’s training to deserve to be on the bench at a minute, so it’s a good story.”",
      "Shepherd will be hoping to make his first team debut in Coventry's next match - a trip to Portsmouth on Tuesday evening. Lampard's team currently sit top of the Championship table after 10 matches.",

      "Jamie Carragher and Liverpool were left angered after referee Michael Oliver didn't stop the game leading up to Manchester United's opening goal at Anfield.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister went down with a head injury after colliding with Virgil van Dijk just inside the Liverpool half. United picked up the second ball, played on and it led to Amad Diallo feeding the ball through to Bryan Mbeumo, who composed himself before crashing the ball past goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "Commentator Peter Drury started: \"What we are getting from the match centre is that the referee didn’t see the injury and was therefore obviously not able to stop the game.\"",
      "Carragher added: \"He was on the floor holding his head.\"",
      "The FA rulebook states: \"Play is stopped if, in their opinion, a player is seriously injured or receives a head injury.\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock, meanwhile, gave his verdict on BBC Radio 5 Live, saying: \"There's a bit of contention about this goal among the Liverpool fans, they think that there's a head injury in midfield. Van Dijk and Mbeumo went up for the header, they clashed with Mac Allister and he is being treated by the physios.",
      "\"Mbeumo got up from it and made a lovely run in behind, Van Dijk switches off, Konate can't get there and he lifts it over the top of the keeper. Brilliant start for Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo's goal was his second in the Premier League for United, after finding the net against Burnley back in August. He looked dangerous in the opening half an hour at Anfield, while Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha also caused Liverpool all sorts of issues early on.",
      "Indeed, Fernandes should have doubled United's lead midway through the first half. Amad set the ball back for the United captain to hit it from inside the box, but he swept his effort just wide.",
      "Cody Gakpo did have an excellent chance to score an equaliser for Liverpool just before that, as he was played through on goal by Mohamed Salah but his strike hit the base of the post and was cleared.",

      "During the international break, takeover rumours sparked when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for the club.",
      "After clarifying that he was not the potential investor, it has since been reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a possible takeover. Cantona has been mentioned as one of the individuals included, potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him support a prospective consortium.",

      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned that he may not be able to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko with his current set-up.",
      "The 22-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in a £74million transfer from RB Leipzig this summer, with Manchester United pipping Newcastle United to his signature. And while the Slovenian impressed in the Bundesliga, he has failed to make much of an impact in the Premier League.",
      "At present, Sesko has scored just two goals from seven appearances for the Reds, and while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he is clearly still a player in development in one of the most physically demanding leagues in the world. And according to former United star Danny Simpson, history could repeat itself at the club if the striker doesn't receive the right support.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips about United's business this summer, Simpson said: \"I think, right, if we are going to play 3-4-3, which we're doing, and not 4-3-3, which now would suit [Bryan] Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes] and [Matheus] Cunha and Sesko - to be honest with you, I think it would - why didn't we buy a centre-mid?",
      "\"You know, let's not pick one of the two, Mbeumo and Cunha. But did we need them both? And you could have had Bruno and one of them and a centre-mid, so Bruno's not playing deep.",
      "\"So, yes, in terms of that, were they trying to get a centre-mid? Maybe they did and he didn't get it over the line - the lad from Brighton [Carlos Baleba], but it was a lot of money. Listen, they brought great players in, but in terms of what we actually need, it's not working right now.",
      "\"Obviously, we prefer Bruno higher. Sesko, I think he will come good, but I just think he also...It would help him to have an experienced striker with him, similar to what's happened with [Rasmus] Hojlund.",
      "“We don't want that to happen again, where it just becomes a point where it's like, so young, it's such a burden, that shirt up front on your own, you've got no help, and before you know it, it's too much.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in a £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, but failed to live up to his price tag in the years that followed. The 22-year-old managed just four Premier League goals last term from 32 games last season, as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko were brought in this summer to give United an attacking edge.",
      "As a result of inconsistency in the north west, Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan this summer, with the Serie A giants holding a £38m obligation to buy the player next year, based on certain requirements being met.",
      "While he is thriving with his new club - with two goals from four games to his name - some fans believe that the issue with his time at United was not having the support of a senior striker to show him the ropes as he continued to develop.",
      "Meanwhile, over in Naples, Hojlund has the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lorenzo Lucca to impart their wisdom on him both on and off the pitch. It comes as Amorim will hope for more consistency from Sesko when the club return to Premier League action this weekend.",
      "The Reds are currently gearing up to face Arne Slot's Liverpool on Sunday, October 19 at Anfield in the first Northwest derby of the season.",
      "While United won their last top flight clash ahead of the international break with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, Liverpool are currently suffering a three-game losing streak thanks to losses at the hands of Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",

      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United supporters ought to be worried by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's commitment to giving Ruben Amorim the full duration of his three-year contract to demonstrate his managerial credentials - despite the difficulties faced during his opening 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils appointed Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement last November, but as he approaches his first year in charge, he's secured victory in fewer than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's poorest-ever campaign last season.",
      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they've won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they've got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",
      "Amorim has yet to secure back-to-back victories in the Premier League since arriving in Manchester. United claimed a crucial three points against Sunderland prior to the international break, but now travel to Anfield this weekend, facing an uphill battle.",
      "Victory for Liverpool could intensify scrutiny on the United manager, though Ratcliffe has dismissed speculation surrounding his position following each defeat.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" he said last week. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "\"We've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward,\" said Mason Mount after winning against Sunderland.",
      "\"For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is rattling along now, with a familiar name already roaring into a significant lead in the race for the Golden Boot.",
      "Erling Haaland is bidding to reclaim his crown after he and everyone else got Mo Salahed last season, and it’s so far so good with the Big Norwegian currently boasting a whopping five-goal lead over an unexpected yet distant nearest challenger.",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "Has done a hugely admirable job thus far of filling a pretty hefty void at Brentford but missed a huge chance to try and remain halfway close to Haaland early in the second half against City.",
      "",
      "Didn’t manage to continue his scoring streak in the 2-1 win at Liverpool. Fair to say this failure was not top of the list of talking points to emerge from that one.",
      "",
      "Made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like now Alexander Isak has been signed.",
      "",
      "It’s a pretty high place on the list for someone currently only third in the league scoring lists among his own team-mates. Also feels quite weird that eight games into the season a mere two goals gets you in the top 20 for the entire division.",
      "",
      "We are pretty confident of two things. One, Woltemade will become a firm cult hero on Tyneside and score a goodly number of goals. Two, that number will not be sufficient to win the Golden Boot, or probably even get that close. Good bit that he’s already scored two headers when all the evidence from Germany was that, despite looking precisely like someone who would score a lot of headers, he doesn’t actually score many headers.",
      "His penalty against Forest was the very definition of ‘aplomb’.",
      "",
      "Proven quality but yet to get off the Premier League mark for his new club following that messy and drawn-out departure from Newcastle.",
      "",
      "This is looking like hope over experience, with Salah miles off it in what is now officially a struggling, crisis-addled Liverpool.",
      "",
      "At some point it really does feel like we’re all going to have to start putting some respect on this start and stop putting him behind people with half as many goals as he’s got.",
      "",
      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line.",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to Semenyo – doing anything all that compelling to challenge him.",
      "Van Dijk was labelled a “baby” by Carragher, Salah looked more like a toddler and Isak doesn’t look worth £25m let alone £125m. The Liverpool trio were awful in defeat ...",
      "Carragher has revealed his ‘one slight worry’ with Salah amid the Liverpool star’s slow start to the season, but doesn’t think ‘he should be asked to do anything different’.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Salah left the Liverpool right-backs horribly exposed against Chelsea and Slot’s press conference should give Man Utd, and one player in particular, a big boost for Sunday.",
      "Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland are currently locked in an absurd goalscoring race, but how have they all simultaneously reached their peak?",
      "The FFP verdict is imminent and if Man City are relegated their players need to be reassigned. You’re welcome, Sheikh Mansour."

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim edge away from crisis after a red-letter day at Anfield, while Liverpool plunge themselves deep into the mire",
      "A damaging defeat for Liverpool in more ways than one has left Arsenal looking more compelling Premier League favourites than ever, and leaves Man City as for now their likeliest and potentially quite soon only rivals.",
      "For Amorim, the gift of time. This was a win that dispels all sack talk, for at least a week.",
      "Let’s get into it.",
      "",
      "1. And there, almost a year into the job, it is. Ruben Amorim wins back-to-back Premier League games for the first time.",
      "Whimsy out of the way, let us now seriously consider what this means. At the start of this weekend Amorim was locked in a two-horse Sack Race with Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou didn’t make it beyond Saturday afternoon, but Amorim has just bought himself considerable time.",
      "This was a wild and ridiculous game, to the point that one could argue it doesn’t necessarily mean anything in the grand scheme. Not everything means anything. Sometimes it’s just a bunch of stuff that happened. And at Anfield, a great big bunch of stuff happened.",
      "But in a frenzied and chaotic football match, United produced the majority of the composed and sane football and were good value for the win that looked to have escaped their grasp before Harry Maguire rose highest to head home the winner and leave Gary Neville and everyone else thoroughly spent.",
      "United are now two points behind Liverpool and a whisker away from fully handing over the crisis club mantle after winning a game some (okay, we) had dubbed El Crisico. United still require a greater number of less emotional and outlandish victories to prove there is something sustainable here, but while this isn’t a result that buys Amorim three years it is one that buys him a significant amount of time in which to work. At least until next week’s inevitable back-to-earth-with-a-bump home defeat to Brighton, anyway.",
      "",
      "2. For Liverpool, the crisis is no longer mini. If that sounds dramatic, it is nobody’s fault but theirs. They crisised themselves here with their frankly absurd approach to a second half of a game that remained very much there to be won – or at least not lost – by more conventional methods.",
      "Liverpool gave the game away – in every sense – with their breakneck, chaos-strewn approach to the second half. Every single one of the last 30 minutes was played like it was the last, and while we suppose Liverpool’s record in injury-time means there is some logic to playing more of the game as if it was in fact injury-time, it did all just look a little bit mad.",
      "Even if it had worked here – and had Cody Gakpo’s astonishingly interesting game in front of goal not ended with a header sent impossibly wide when a second equaliser appeared certain then it may well have done – it would still have ceded the title advantage further toward Arsenal.",
      "While the Gunners go about their business for now in a composed and thoroughly sustainable manner, Liverpool have become a team for whom the Hail Mary has become too regular and too early a choice from the playbook.",
      "",
      "3. There can be no doubt that Arne Slot is under pressure like never before at Liverpool after a third straight league defeat and fourth in all, and one in which his part can be significantly questioned. There was barely an hour on the clock when he went to a sh*t-or-bust 4-2-4 formation in which Florian Wirtz was, at least theoretically, one of the two central midfielders.",
      "That is not a play a title-winning team is making when one goal down with 30 minutes remaining at home against a mid-table team that had conceded 11 goals in its first seven league games of the season.",
      "If there was one word to describe Liverpool and their manager and their star players here it was this: rattled. From quite literally the very first minute.",
      "It is not a word generally linked to serious title contenders.",
      "",
      "4. And the worst thing for Liverpool is who the most rattled players were. It is not even particularly mischievous to suggest the two worst players on the pitch today were Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah.",
      "The two players more responsible than perhaps any others for the success the club has enjoyed over recent years both had absolute stinkers in the worst possible fixture.",
      "",
      "5. Van Dijk’s day to forget began in the very first minute. He made not one, not two, but three individual errors in the immediate build-up to United’s opening goal. Four if you count colliding with team-mate Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "A poor headed clearance and clattering of Bryan Mbeumo (and Mac Allister) was followed by a tackle attempt that registered as weak-to-non-existent on the tackle-ferocity-o-meter, and then a gentle jog back towards the escalating trouble in front of Liverpool’s goal as he let Mbeumo run beyond him while airily suggesting to Ibrahima Konate that he might like to deal with this unpleasantness, please.",
      "It was a string of uncharacteristic errors from a man who has been the most reliable of all Liverpool players for so long now, but on whose 34-year-old shoulders Liverpool have placed a frankly irresponsible level of faith and expectation across this long and in theory multi-competition season.",
      "",
      "6. And he never really did regain his composure. Having had to nurse Konate through much of the first chunk of this season, today the roles were reversed to an alarming degree, with Konate clearly Liverpool’s most – and at times apparently only – accomplished defender on display.",
      "Despite a role in the build-up to the equaliser, Van Dijk’s story was one of further errors and increasing rattle. Every close-up from the TV director appeared to be of Van Dijk walking away from some new unexpected unpleasantness shaking his head.",
      "With United playing most of the game with no real number-nine, Van Dijk didn’t really seem to know what to do with himself or where to go. He was dragged out wide by Mbeumo and into midfield by Matheus Cunha, with Milos Kerkez outside him similar uncertain about who precisely should be his primary concern out of Mbeumo and an impish Amad Diallo.",
      "The visible headloss reached its peak when Van Dijk shanked a clearance into Kerkez and set about berating his team-mate for the apparent crime of not being hologrammatic.",
      "",
      "7. And then there was Salah. That was… very not good. Liverpool are missing Trent Alexander-Arnold desperately, but nobody more so than Salah, who has lost all confidence and appears to have forgotten who he is.",
      "As can often happen to great players in a rut, his decision-making has gone out of the window. Passing when he should shoot, shooting when he should pass. Running at defenders in general is just something he probably shouldn’t be doing right now; he has still yet to complete a dribble this season and lost possession 16 times today.",
      "The nadir came shortly after the hour, though, when his big chance came to bring Liverpool level as a cross arrived to him barely six yards from goal and with time to take a touch before finishing.",
      "It was just bizarre. We are talking about one of the great players of the Premier League here, but he took that chance like someone who had only had football badly explained to him by someone who’d watched half a game several years earlier while not really paying attention.",
      "We want to say he mishit his shot well wide of the target, but it wasn’t even that. It was like he couldn’t even work out which part of his boot he wanted or needed to use. He kicked it really bloody hard, in entirely the wrong direction. A slice would be bad, but it would be easier to explain than this apparent total failure to even realise what was required.",
      "",
      "8. Salah was probably fortunate to stay on as long as he did given the performance, but such is his status here and across the league that it was nevertheless striking to note he was withdrawn when Liverpool went in forlorn pursuit of their second equaliser.",
      "That new Salah contract is not looking the best piece of clear-eyed decision-making right now. Nor the starry-eyed decision to chase ever greater attacking coups in the transfer market while the more mundane but necessary business of sorting out the centre of that defence were left unfinished.",
      "",
      "9. It also feels a bit of a worry that with the player of the year in their ranks and having spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new attacking talent, Liverpool’s most effective attacking player for most of the game was Cody Gakpo, and for the last few minutes of it was Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Gakpo had an extraordinary game really, hitting the woodwork three times, very nearly slicing an attempted clearance into his own net, scoring from a yard out while getting far too close to comfort to hitting the post with that effort as well, given the whole goal was available to him, and then heading badly wide when seeming certain to equalise again.",
      "The first and third shots that hit the post were wonderful efforts, the second an attempted cross, but it is that missed header that will haunt his dreams tonight.",
      "",
      "10. Liverpool’s best moments down the right-hand side came in the few minutes Frimpong spent out there rather than the 90-odd of Salah. It was his cross from which Gakpo really should have done so much better, with another dangerous delivery arriving soon after.",
      "By this point Liverpool’s formation was barely even worth giving hypothetical consideration, but with this being not the first time we’ve seen Frimpong playing a more advanced role and Dominik Szoboszlai deployed at right-back, it all adds to the bizarroworld sensation that this is a Liverpool team where nothing is quite operating as it should, or very often where it should.",
      "",
      "11. And we’ve not even got to Isak yet. Or Wirtz. Sometimes even 16 Conclusions isn’t enough and we really do want to make at least a couple of these about what United did right rather than what Liverpool did wrong.",
      "But it was another painful afternoon for both big-money summer arrivals, with Isak’s sole contribution being to tamely fail to score a one-on-one after being brilliantly found by Konate’s throughball, and doing so in precisely the kind of way that forces the entire punditocracy by strict co-commentary law to stroke their beards and ponder thoughtfully that a confident Newcastle Isak definitely scores there.",
      "",
      "12. United, though. Let’s talk about them for a bit. Because this is a huge day for Manchester United. The performance was good, and in places excellent. But it still feels a lot like this was a day more about what Liverpool did wrong than what United did right.",
      "It’s not to downplay United’s role in it all, just that Liverpool brought such uncontrolled chaos and wildness to proceedings that in a curious way their own total lack of control and composure meant United never really had any chance to introduce their own to the game.",
      "What they did was produce a full-blooded effort all over the pitch for all 98 minutes or whatever it was in the end, and take the fullest advantage of Liverpool’s confusion.",
      "",
      "13. And that was right from the off. There was one team switched on and aware of what was happening as that first moment of significance unravelled itself before them. Mbeumo was so smartly up off the canvas and back into play after being initially clattered by van Dijk, and expertly found by Amad who was excellent throughout.",
      "His finish was more power than precision, but that was very much enough. It rattled Liverpool, and they never truly recovered.",
      "There were further chances – most involving Bruno Fernandes and/or Amad in some capacity and, even when Liverpool were making some headway of their own, never any sense of a game spiralling out of United’s control. They surely can’t have predicted or expected Liverpool’s gameplan to become quite so wild quite so quickly, but they kept their heads admirably in the face of it all, especially given what was at stake.",
      "",
      "14. But most impressive was their response to the equaliser when it finally came. It would have been so easy then for heads to drop, for the apparently inevitable to be accepted. Especially for a team that has had so many more bad days than good ones over the last year or so.",
      "Gary Neville said just before Harry Maguire’s winner that he felt there was still a goal for United here, and while the speed with which that proved true was spectacular, it was also just a straightforwardly true observation.",
      "Liverpool had chosen chaos so early and thoroughly that after the equaliser there was no way to get that toothpaste back in the tube. No way to revert to any semblance of a more measured approach.",
      "And it was a delightful winning goal, with Bruno’s cushioned volleyed cross from a cleared corner a thing of beauty that arced inexorably onto the head of Maguire with an outcome that felt a certainty from long before it played out in apparent slow-motion.",

What was surprising was that Maguire’s 84th-minute goal, despite having far more the feeling of a goal arriving in the 94th minute, would prove to be the last.",
      "It just felt certain that this game, especially given this Liverpool team and its penchant for injury-time shenanigans, had one more nonsense in store. A Van Dijk equaliser, perhaps, for the narrative.",

      "Former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief Keith Hackett has given his verdict on Bryan Mbeumo’s controversial opener for Manchester United in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool, which “surprised” Jamie Carragher.",
      "Harry Maguire scored the late winner for United after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Mbeumo’s first-minute goal, which led several Liverpool players to confront referee Michael Oliver as Alexis Mac Allister lay on the ground clutching his head.",
      "Reds captain Virgil van Dijk had elbowed his teammate in the build-up to the goal, and the contention was that Oliver should have blown his whistle, as is the custom for head injuries.",
      "But Hackett believes the correct decision was made, with VAR unable to intervene if – as Oliver suggests was the case – the referee did not see the head injury.",
      "“Three players challenged in a fair manner for the ball which bounced and put Man United on the attack. They went in to score a good goal,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "“It appeared that Referee Oliver had not seen the head injury and play was allowed to continue. Goal scored and correctly allowed.",
      "“VAR cannot intervene on this it is not a clear and obvious error.”",
      "Offering up his thoughts on the incident, Carragher said on commentary: “I have been frustrated that players have taken advantage of that rule. There was an incident in the Arsenal game yesterday near the dugout, and the referee pulled it back.",
      "“I am very surprised Michael Oliver hasn’t brought it back.”",
      "Gary Neville was left stunned by Van Dijk’s role in the goal, saying on commentary: “Mac Allister goes down, but what stuns me is Van Dijk. Mbeumo runs off him; he can’t see him. That is the big surprise.",
      "“Mbeumo reacts like a boxer off the ground, and he is away. Mamardashvili can’t keep it out, a stunning start for Manchester United. I can’t work out if Van Dijk is trying to play him offside. He points towards Konate as if to say, ‘That is your man.’ It is a strange handover from him.”",
      "Redknapp added: “It is brilliant from United but Van Dijk makes a big mistake. He has to sprint back. Yes there is a collision but you have to get back into shape. He can’t just pass it on to [Ibrahima] Konate.”",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been working on a ‘secret’ Manchester United mission for ages but it’s public knowledge now, while Liverpool are always transfer geniuses.",
      "Man Utd forward Bryan Mbeumo is attempting to convince Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves would like to see Benjamin Sesko dropped for Bryan Mbeumo in a tactical reshuffle.",
      "There is glee about a Proper Title Race, debate over whether Viktor Gyokeres will fly or flop, a tip for Nuno to be sacked and excitement over…Everton?!",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",

      "Virgil van Dijk was labelled a “baby” by Jamie Carragher, Mohamed Salah looked more like a toddler and Alexander Isak doesn’t look worth £25m let alone £125m. The Liverpool trio were awful in defeat to Manchester United.",
      "The narrative this season surrounding Liverpool’s defensive woes has been that Ibrahima Konate’s downturn – amid a contract standoff and interest from Real Madrid which is now cooling as a result of his slump – has been too dramatic for the brilliance of Van Dijk to nullify.",
      "But after an extraordinary passage of play in the first minute at Anfield which saw Manchester United take the lead, we were forced to consider the possibility that Konate’s decline and Liverpool’s collective malaise is in part down to their captain not quite being ‘at it’ this season.",
      "Either that or Van Dijk’s mind and body hadn’t yet woken up – and never really did – to a game against Liverpool’s fiercest rivals in which nothing short of victory would put paid to doubts over their ability to stay the course with Arsenal in the title race. Neither reflects well on him.",
      "He goes games, weeks, months, often seemingly full seasons without making mistakes, but made three – four if you count the head injury he inflicted on Alexis Mac Allister – in less than ten seconds at the start of this game, and spent the rest of the it, as Gary Neville said on commentary, “not knowing whether to stick or twist”.",
      "After clattering into the back of Bryan Mbeumo while failing to deal with a long ball, nailing Mac Allister with an elbow in the process, Van Dijk then dangled a leg in an almost comically weak effort to block Bruno Fernandes’ pass to Amad Diallo, before Mbeumo ran off the back of him to score.",
      "We’ve seen him jog back into position thousands of times, but typically in an ‘I’m far better than you so don’t need to break a sweat’ sort of way, rather than with the air of negligence we saw here, exacerbated by him vaguely pointing Mbeumo out to Konate rather than marking him himself.",
      "Milos Kerkez was having another nightmare alongside him and we must also ask questions as to what Arne Slot has done since their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace to coach Liverpool to play against the 3-4-3 formation given their evident problems with dealing with it again here.",
      "Without a true No.9 to play against, Van Dijk was continually dragged out of position and looked genuinely uncomfortable no matter if he was out wide being faced up by Mbeumo or pulled into midfield, with those moments scrambling his brain to such an extent that by half time he was losing a physical battle to Matheus Cunha.",
      "Slicing a cross into the face of Kerkez before shouting at the full-back for failing to talk to him combined his new-found defensive inadequacy and the all too familiar Van Dijk quirk of blaming anyone else for his own mistakes. And while the Van Dijk aura returned briefly to create Liverpool’s equaliser through a fine tackle to prevent a United counter-attack, he was then seen marking no-one as Harry Maguire scored the Red Devils’ winner, with Matthijs de Ligt also free at the back post.",
      "“For most of the season Van Dijk’s been looking after a baby in Konate; it’s now the other way around,” Carragher said on commentary. But short of his much-maligned centre-back as a scapegoat, Liverpool did have two other very willing, highly respected patsies to draw focus from the entirely rattled captain.",
      "Alexander Isak missed a golden opportunity having been sent through beautifully by Konate, but hit his shot straight at Senne Lammens. He dragged another one wide, and could have played Mohamed Salah in when well place on another occasion. Slot said this week that Isak has now completed his delayed pre-season, so this is now just bad football from the £125m man.",
      "Not quite as bad as Salah though, who was as poor as we’ve ever seen him for Liverpool against the team he loves playing against most, with the nadir evidenced by him kicking the ball with the wrong part of his boot, like he was a toddler lining up the effort at the back post, when granted a golden chance to make it 17 goals in 18 games against United.",
      "The surprise wasn’t that Salah was replaced by Jeremie Frimpong in the 85th minute when chasing the game but that it took Slot that long to realise that the Egyptian was proving a hindrance to Liverpool, now in attack as well as defence.",
      "And on the back of a first United win at Anfield for a decade, after which Ruben Amorim and his players obviously deserve huge credit (which you will find in 16 Conclusions later), although the visitors played their part in the mini-crisis becoming a full-blown one, the upgrade is mainly Liverpool’s doing.",
      "Thanks to Slot for treating the last 30+ minutes as though it was the last, to two Liverpool legends in Salah and Van Dijk for shrinking when they really needed them and to the summer signing who was supposed to take this brilliant team to the next level rather than ushering in this dramatic fall from grace.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the Premier League Golden Boot with Erling Haaland disappearing over the horizon already.",
      "Liverpool are no longer in mini-crisis after a chaotic headloss of a defeat to Manchester United, where Ruben Amorim has bought himself time.",

      "Carragher has revealed his ‘one slight worry’ with Salah amid the Liverpool star’s slow start to the season, but doesn’t think ‘he should be asked to do anything different’.",
      "Salah left the Liverpool right-backs horribly exposed against Chelsea and Slot’s press conference should give Man Utd, and one player in particular, a big boost for Sunday.",
      "Mohamed Salah was reportedly ‘amazed’ at the ‘atmosphere’ at one of the stadiums he has played at this season, and asked a former rival “is every match like this?” in ..."

      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",
      "Amorim is yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches since becoming Man Utd manager around a year ago with the Red Devils boss picking up just 37 points from 34 matches.",
      "That has led to rumours that Amorim could be sacked if those poor results persist but Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that the Portuguese coach could remain at Man Utd for three years as he gives him a chance to proove himself.",
      "After Ratcliffe’s comments were put to him, Keane said: “Listen, I think it’s probably good getting the backing off the club and the board, but results obviously have to improve. You hope, of course, any manager is given time. Whether he’s going to get three years to play with, it will depend on how they do over next few months.",
      "READ: Why Ruben Amorim is ‘really annoyed’ with Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes",
      "“They have picked up a little bit, we said at the start of the season, with a couple of attacking players they look like more of a goal threat, and particularly at home, they’ve improved their home record, and on the back of a nice result to home to Sunderland, which I fully expect them to win.",
      "“But the big tests are still games like today [against Liverpool]. What kind of group they have? Are going to turn up here today and show their quality going forward? Are they trying to grind the result out? Are they going to be physical? Are they going to put tackles in? So there’s still huge question marks away from home. Yeah, they’ve picked up, but coming to Liverpool a huge test for me.",
      "“There’s still huge question marks over this United group. I just don’t see it at this moment in time, but the signs are a little bit better going forward, but you still worry about in midfield, in terms of the physicality, and you worry about them defensively. And again, question marks still over the goalkeeper situation.”",
      "Carragher chipped in: “I actually want to come in on those comments, because I understand what the owner is trying to do. He’s trying to quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“So he comes out to defend his man. He talks about, you know, he’s got three years. But he almost doesn’t help him by saying it, because nobody believes it. Nobody believes for one minute that Ruben Amorim will be the manager of Manchester United in three years.",
      "“If he just said, ‘we’ve got no plans to change our coach over the next 12 months.’ I think we’d go ‘okay, maybe they could get to the end of the season. Maybe things can improve. They can get someone in January.’ That would almost feel like a vote of confidence in that, you know, quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“But to come out and say three years, we all know that, as Roy’s just said, if the results keep going as they’re going he’s going to lose his job, unfortunately. So even though he’s come out trying to help him, I don’t think he has actually helped him with those comments in the end.”",
      "Before Redknapp went in hard on Amorim for failing to win back-to-back matches at Man Utd, he said: “When you’ve not won back-to-back games in the Premier League as Man United manager, you are coming under intense pressure. I think you could get any manager in any league in England and I fancy him to pick a team with this Man United squad, and win back to back games, that would be the challenge.",
      "“And it can’t be that difficult, but he’s making it look difficult every single week, like Roy says, some weeks you watch him and say: ‘yeah, there’s glimpses here, they’ve got a chance. They’ve got some good players, good performances.’ Then it will just go back to the madness and the same substitutions. Forget the system, he’s  not going to change it whatever we say.",
      "“But you can’t not win back-to-back games as Manchester United manager and then say that he’s going to still be there three years. It just doesn’t make any sense.",
      "“It’s not the real world. And also, if he’s still there after a year, and this is not changing, the fans will dictate that. They won’t suffer it because they want to see change. They don’t like the situation the club are in.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has set an optimistic target for Manchester United this season, but it would be a year too late for Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Mainoo was denied his request to leave the club on loan in the summer and has featured for just 237 minutes to far this season; Zirkzee was also linked with the exit – a return to Serie A was mooted – and is now understandably ‘deeply frustrated’ with his 116 minutes of game time this term.",
      "It would be a bitter pill to swallow at the best of times with the World Cup coming at the end of the campaign, but in a United team struggling for creativity which either could theoretically provide, it would be fair for both Mainoo and Zirkzee to question just how bad the teammates currently preferred by Amorim would have to be for them to be given an opportunity.",
      "READ: Liverpool vs Man Utd: Five pre-match predictions from Rooney, Keane, Redknapp et al.",
      "Victory over Sunderland before the international break kept the wolves from Amorim’s door and the vote of confidence from Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggests his sacking isn’t in the offing anytime soon. But with champions Liverpool to come on Sunday as Amorim still searches for consecutive Premier League wins for the first time in close to a year at Old Trafford, the United manager’s target for the season feels optimistic as Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and others threaten the Big Six hegemony.",
      "“We want to go to Europe,” he said ahead of the clash with Liverpool. “We need to return to Europe.",
      "“This club’s success is to win the Premier League. We have to be honest with our fans that we are not in that moment.",
      "“We need to be really clear on that, so I am not going to call success going to Europe, or finishing in the [top] eight or six, or whatever. That is not success.",

      "He also responded to continued speculation over the futures of Mainoo and Zirkzee.",
      "“I understand that but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season,” he added.",
      "“I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. Players are not playing. They want to play, and there’s a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.”",
      "The cost of failing to qualify for Europe last season, beyond the financial implications, is the lack of opportunities afforded to those not in the first XI this term; being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town exacerbates the problem.",
      "Manchester United will have played 20 games this season before the January transfer window opens. Clubs competing in Europe will have played 27 if they reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals.",
      "Aside perhaps from a congested Premier League fixture list around Christmas, Amorim doesn’t and won’t have the same need to rotate as other big-club managers. If he’s not going to field bit-part players on the back of international breaks that they haven’t been a part of ahead of those that have, as we strongly suspect will be the case at Anfield on Sunday, what hope do Mainoo or Zirkzee have of getting enough game time to stake their World Cup claims?",
      "Amorim might claim he “needs” them, but amid what will be growing pressure from agents and a perfectly possible negative dressing room atmosphere created by frustration and perceived injustice, the United chiefs may feel as though they have little option but to grant the exit wishes of Mainoo and Zirkzee.",

      "On whether he could see himself having a role at Man Utd in the future, Beckham added: “I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business.",

      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has described the potential implications of Man Utd’s share price increasing by eight per cent amid recent takeover rumours.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “It’s a reaction to the media stuff we saw around the Saudi Arabia potential, the quote from the fairly well renowned Saudi Arabia individual who put this out there and speculated around a takeover that’s what’s driven the share price up ultimately.",
      "“It’s absolutely fuelled by speculation around a takeover. For what it means for the club, it’s more for the shareholders, the investors, any share price going up reflects positively on them ultimately and that means that the share price is higher.",
      "“It won’t make too big a difference to the day-to-day finances and the operations of the club. In terms of the share price going up you treat those things as good news stories for a company that the share price is increasing.",
      "“That share price ultimately is going to benefit the shareholders and the investors at a certain point in time, which is again the other side of the coin with this one because the current owners don’t look like they want to sell right now and Jim Ratcliffe came in for the minority stakes so its them who would benefit from a share increase but obviously they are not looking to sell the club.”",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",

      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Nottm Forest was handy, too.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",

      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",

      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",
      "Amorim has explained why he is “really annoyed” with Bruno Fernandes as the Man Utd boss confirmed a key decision ahead of the clash with Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Amorim says he “needs” Zirkzee and Mainoo but he’s got a funny way of showing it. His optimistic season target would be a year too late for the Man Utd ...",
      "A ‘petty hate narrative’ on Ruben Amorim has been debunked, while we have an extended England World Cup ladder that includes Gary Neville…",
      "According to reports, a ‘shock’ Manchester United manager target is confident of being chosen to replace head coach Ruben Amorim.",

      "All three Chelsea players who scored against Nottingham Forest claimed their first Premier League manager scalp in doing so when Ange Postecoglou was sacked.",
      "The following is a rundown of the players who scored in a Premier League manager’s last game before losing their job. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",

Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "A total of 249 different players have induced one manager exit by scoring at least once in their final game. This number includes such names as Celestine Babayaro (Kenny Dalglish, Newcastle), Jon Flanagan (Andre Villas-Boas, Spurs), Vinnie Jones (Ron Atkinson, Aston Villa), Gary O’Neil (Peter Reid, Leeds), Arturo Vidal (Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea), and Josh Acheampong, who helped put Ange Postecoglou out of his Nottingham Forest misery.",

      "However, Casemiro has played regularly for Man Utd this season and a new report from Football Insider‘s Pete O’Rourke has ‘backed’ them to ‘agree a new deal’ as long as he accepts a pay cut after this was ‘unthinkable a year ago’.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "In the summer, Rashford joined Barcelona from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy for around £30m.",
      "Barcelona decided to take a punt on Rashford after failing to acquire Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, with the England international’s versatility and return to form at Aston Villa helping him secure his dream transfer.",
      "This transfer is paying off for Barcelona and Rashford as the forward has three goals and five assists in his ten appearances this season.",

      "Despite this, Rashford will reportedly ‘quit’ Man Utd even if his move to Barcelona ‘collapses’, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming that “there will be no shortage of interest in him”.",
      "“It’s a sad thing from Man United’s point of view that I don’t see him coming back, but I have no doubt there are a lot of clubs keeping an eye on his situation,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "READ: ‘Petty’ Amorim ‘hate narrative’ debunked as 50 more stars in extended England World Cup ladder",
      "“If he doesn’t stay at Barcelona, there will be no shortage of interest in him, especially if he can keep up the form he has shown.",
      "“But ideally I think he’s got his heart set on staying at Barcelona and hopes he can stay there long-term, and if he keeps performing I don’t see why they wouldn’t keep him.”",
      "Romano, meanwhile, claims Rashford “could be open” to having a “different kind of salary structure” to “facilitate a potential move to Barcelona”.",
      "“In all the conversations he has had with Hansi Flick and in all the conversation also internally at Barcelona with people at the club, Marcus Rashford is being very clear his desire is to be a Barcelona player beyond this season,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rashford is doing very well. He’s very happy with the club, with the coach, with the city, with the teammates, Rashford is loving his life at Barcelona and the idea for Rashford is to try to stay at Barca if they decide to keep him and if they will be able to reach an agreement with Man United, either triggered by their buy option of close to €30 million or to negotiate with United.",
      "“We will see what happens in summer 2026 if Barcelona want to keep Rashford. In that case, my understanding is that Rashford could also be open to have a discussion on a different kind of salary structure compared to his current one at Man United in order to facilitate a potential move to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford already changed his salary structure in order to join Barcelona, but United are not paying his salary. Barcelona is paying the main part of the salary and the other part is something that Marcus Rashford decided to accept not to take in order to be a Barcelona player this season.",
      "“It’s still very early to predict the future of Rashford, but there is a very good feeling between Rashford, Barcelona and Flick. Obviously we have to see in the second half of the season what happens.",
      "“Nothing will be decided now in October, in November, in December, this is not the time to reach agreements for summer 2026. But the feeling now is very good.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",

      "So there was a call for reply by an Amorim supporter and though that’s not how I’d class myself the fact I don’t want his head on a pike likely means that’s how you see me. Your regular letters bashing United for one thing or another needn’t come with a warning like Stewie’s rants because you can see them coming a mile off, and though this current thorn in your arse regards the academy we all know its rooted in the decision to ditch your messiah Ten Hag 12 months ago. Time to get over that one I think.",
      "However to stay on topic, the talents you’ve singled out are indeed promising players though which Fletcher are you referring to? Them being twins does mean there are two of them. The choice of Lacey and Biancheri seems more about their slight builds than anything, they are still teenagers though so perhaps that always be the case and you only have to look at Amorim favourite Bruno to see that if you’re good enough then size doesn’t matter to him.",
      "The academy does have many other promising players and some might be very well suited to the current system. Where are your comments on Kone, Scanlon, or Ibragimov. The Fletcher brothers could do very well and so too Mantato. Its almost like you chose a few very specific examples to help push your Amorim hating narrative.",
      "You don’t actually care about the progress of these lads at all. We can see this in the total absence of concern for all those previous academy lads that didn’t make it at United. I don’t recall your furious letters demanding United change how they play for the delicate Shoretire and where was your anger for Andreas Periera, James Garner, and Angel Gomes.",
      "When it comes down to it your base argument is backward. The academy exists to produce players that are good enough for the first team. The academy adapts to the first team requirements, not the other way around. If some players make it then great, if they don’t then I’m sure they will have good careers elsewhere, that’s the simple fact of every academy. Trying to twist this into a negative against the current manager who you don’t like is just petty.\nDave, Manchester",

      "Hi Mailbox,",
      "It’s my view that the pool of England qualified players is deeper than I can ever recall. 10 years or so ago I think it was probably hard to find 50 plausible players to fill the ladder. I thought to myself today – ‘all of those 50 (apart from Phil) are perfectly plausible contenders for an England squad, I wonder whether we can get to 100’. So I tried that.",
      "Short answer is, no I don’t really think there are 100 plausible options there, but there might be 75. I’d be interested to know what others think!",
      "Here’s the list:",
      "51) Liam Delap – given the paucity of non-Harry Kane striking options, Delap will leap way into the top 50 if he can get fit and scoring. Big if, but he has the tools.",
      "52) Mason Mount – we know Tuchel likes him, and understandably so given his excellence in Chelsea’s European Cup winning campaign. Presses well, consummate team man, but significant competition in the attacking midfield means he would need to up his game significantly . This might be difficult in such a dysfunctional side as Man Utd.",
      "53) Benjamin White – has he declared himself available? Not sure. And possibly not getting enough minutes, given the form of the exemplary Timber. But has a great relationship with Saka and can defend well, thus ticking a couple of Tuchely boxes.",
      "54) Rico Lewis – despite being just 20 he has 62 Manchester City appearances and 5 for England, however he hasn’t made a squad for more than a year. He’s a skilled, adaptable operator but the feeling persists that he may be too physically slight for both Tuchel and Pep for his preferred full back and defensive midfield roles.",
      "55) Eric Dier – with 49 caps, he could be a leadershippy, experiencey squad pick in the mould of Jordan Henderson. He’s somewhat versatile and is still playing regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. In a 26 man squad, he wouldn’t be the worst 26th man.",
      "56) Tyrick Mitchell – unlucky to only have two England caps, but could be hampered by playing as wing-back in a back three system that England are unlikely to deploy. He’s been integral for Palace and might deserve a chance in a position that is yet to be definitively claimed.",
      "57) Angel Gomes – a key man for Lee Carlsey, who used his passing skills as a crucial midfield pivot. He’s been surpassed by Elliott Anderson and probably Adam Wharton too, but he is playing Champions League football at Marseille and could be a decent option if required.",
      "58) James Maddison – badly injured, but could he play his way into contention by getting fit and firing by the end of the season? Probably not.",
      "59) Joe Gomez – it’s hard to believe he’s still only 28, but he’s a dependable and versatile defender who rarely lets Liverpool down when called upon. He’s suffered a bit with injuries, but given the form of Konate, I could easily see him getting a run in the Liverpool side, which could precipitate a return to the England reckoning.",
      "60) James Tarkowski – he’s a really good defender, in the head it and block it mould of Dan Burn, and like Burn he’s probably an underrated distributor too. A substantial England career might have passed him by, but I wouldn’t be concerned if I saw him in the squad.",
      "61) Rio Ngumoha – if he were to nail down the spot on the left of Liverpool’s attack, his talent is such that he could challenge Gordon and Rashford for a spot. This will probably happen one day, but it’s unlikely to be this season given he’s just 17.",
      "62) Jamie Gittens – frankly it’s a bit odd that a player signed for nearly 50 million from Dortmund by Chelsea is this low, but I haven’t really seen him do anything much in a Chelsea shirt as yet. Perhaps he’ll explode into life in time to make a late run into squad contention.",
      "63) Tyrone Mings – was thrown into the England Team in Euro 2020 (2021, really) and let nobody down. I can’t really see a repeat happening, especially given Villa’s form, but you never know.",
      "64) James McAtee – the captain of the successful England U21 side in the summer, he’s not really found his feet at Forest yet. He’s a tidy and skilled player, but will have to motor to warrant consideration in such a stacked position.",
      "65) James Garner – playing really well for Everton under Moyes and could definitely be a thought if messrs Anderson, Henderson and Wharton were all to get caught in some sort of freak yachting accident.",
      "66) Alex Scott – same as James Garner, really.",
      "67) Jadon Sancho – what has gone on with him? Chelsea paid money to avoid signing him permanently. Clearly, there is talent there. He showed that when loaned back to Dortmund, but he’s never shown it in the Premiership and that looks unlikely to change at Villa, who clearly only signed him in desperation.",
      "68) Tyler Dibling – a fun player to watch and a sensational dribbler, but currently doesn’t have the end product to truly push himself into contention. I’m not sure that will change this season, but am hopeful it may in the future.",
      "69) Archie Gray – acquitted himself well while playing out of position in a dreadful Spurs side last season, but has only played 72 premier league minutes this time round. A talented player who may go onto win many caps, but I suspect that his time is still to come.",
      "70) Callum Hudson-Odoi – he was stellar for Forest last season, and may even have deserved a return to the England fold, but Forest being quite so poor this time around cannot he helpful. Has the kind of pacy direct profile that Tuchel seems to value.",
      "71) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – he’s a nice player and a good signing for Everton. I’d be surprised to see him picked given all the talent in his position.",
      "72) Max Dowman – a generational talent. Unbelievably good for his age. But his age is currently 15. So yeah, bit early.",
      "73) Marcus Tavernier – who is the most unfairly overlooked English player in the Premiership? This guy. Consistently a strong contributor for the excellent Bournemouth, he’s in the top 15% of Premier league attacking midfielders for progressive passes, tackles, and aerials won. Will this be enough to get him in the England squad? Not a chance.",
      "74) Jacob Murphy – on the subject of being overlooked… if it was ever going to happen for Murphy, it was probably last season, where he received no sniff of a call-up despite 8 goals and 12 assists. Unfortunate really, but it’s not going to happen.",
      "75) Jacob Ramsey – Newcastle spent big money on him in the Summer and have wanted him for some time. He moves with the ball very well. However, he’s not really played much in the black and white, so doesn’t seem a likely prospect.",
      "76) Lloyd Kelly – it feels a bit weird that a Juventus first-team central defender is English and yet he is nowhere near the England squad, but here we are.",
      "77) Brooke Norton-Cuffy – funnily enough, he’s also been linked with Juve, and he has been looking a fine prospect for Genoa and the England u-21s. He can certainly get up and down the right touchline with aplomb and might feature one day. But not soon.",
      "78) Max Kilman – he’s been closer to the England team at points in the past. Doesn’t help that West Ham are faintly rubbish.",
      "79) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – his England career is probably a thing of the past. But we aren’t exactly replete with back up strikers, so a decent run of form could drive him upwards on this list. Do I think that’s likely? No.",
      "80) Jobe Bellingham – the lesser Bellingham, but not lacking in talent. He probably needs to stop his dad from bickering with the powers-that-be at Dortmund and put a sustained run of form together. Even if he does, it’s likely too soon for him.",
      "81) Jack Hinshelwood – always looks pretty good at Brighton and quite versatile too. I’d be quite surprised to see that translate into England caps in the short-to-medium term.",
      "82) Fikayo Tomori – if it was ever going to happen for Fikayo, it’s not now. Shame really. He was born in Canada – might be worth exploring that.",
      "83) Josh King – an ever present for Fulham this season and a lovely, balanced dribbler. Definitely too soon for him.",
      "84) Charlie Cresswell – played well for England u21s and a strong player for Toulouse. Probably needed a move to a bigger club if he was going to contend for the World Cup squad.",
      "85) Tyler Morton – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Lyon and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "86) CJ Egan-Riley – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Marseille and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "87) Omari Hutchinson – Forest signed him for biggish money after a ho-hum season for Ipswich. Looked excellent for the u21s. Doesn’t feel a natural fit for Dycheball if that’s what Forest see-saw into next.",
      "88) Eddie Nketiah – hasn’t really done much for Palace, but it’s probably a little hard when Mateta is an imperious first choice. Still, as with a few on this list if he puts a run of goals together, there may be a squad spot for the taking.",
      "89) Ryan Sessegnon – has been deputising ably for Antonee Robinson and it’s great to see him back to fitness and form, however it’s hard to see how that translates into becoming an England player.",
      "90) Anthony Patterson – haven’t named a goalkeeper in the above. I’d like to have done so but couldn’t think of one. Patterson isn’t even number one at Sunderland. Where have all the good English keepers gone?",

      "Hi there,",
      "Keir Starmer has condemned the decision by West Midlands Police to ban away supporters from Aston Villa’s home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv . Now, this decision seems to have been taken a) because there is a legitimate fear that protests against Israeli clubs’ participation in sporting events, in a diverse part of an inner city in the UK, could have public order implications, and more importantly b) because the last time these supporters played a fixture in Europe, they committed serious public order offences in Amsterdam.",
      "There are allegations and counter-allegations about the nature of the supporters’ behaviour in Amsterdam, but it seems that Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were in some cases the victims of racially-motivated abuse and violence, but also, and this is not denied by anyone, also the perpetrators of racially-motivated abuse and violence.",
      "You can have an opinion about whether or not Israeli clubs should be banned from international sporting competition (for the record, there’s a fairly compelling case that Israel have repeatedly violated FIFA and UEFA statutes, and there is the clear precedent of Russia who have been suspended from international competition following their invasion of Ukraine) and you can have an opinion about whether or not this decision is particularly risk-averse, but linking this, as both the Prime Minister and LOTO have, with anti-semitism is prima facie absurd, and actually quite dangerous.",
      "If supporters of an English football club rioted in another European City, and a subsequent European city’s authorities decided that they couldn’t be doing with them, then I don’t believe that the Prime Minister or Leader Of The Opposition would have anything to say about it at all. So why are they making a stand on behalf of supporters of a club from another nation?",
      "Maybe it’s the politicians who should be keeping politics out of football, not footballers past or present?\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "Apologies for this, but I need to put my thoughts across on another instance of politics crossing into football so please feel free to stop reading at this point if you’re not interested or cba with it all.",
      "Yesterday my club Aston Villa put out a statement to say that on the advice of the Safety Advisory Group, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be allowed to attend our match with them in the Europa League on 6th November.  As someone who will be attending the match myself, I welcomed this decision on the basis that it has been made on safety grounds – for those that have never been to Aston, it is a heavily Asian populated area with quite a few mosques so the introduction of a set of fans who have previously been known for racist and aggressive behaviour abroad doesn’t require a lot of mental gymnastics to see how this has got the potential to be a very dangerous situation.  For anyone that isn’t aware, this makes for some very interesting reading.",
      "Now we have various politicians including our very own prime minister chipping in to say that the decision is wrong and “antisemetic” – but is it? Antisemitism is defined as “prejudice or hatred against Jewish people, which can manifest as hostile actions or rhetoric toward individuals, their property, or Jewish community institutions”.  I’m pretty confident in saying that this decision wasn’t taken based on the fact that Maccabi fans are Jewish but instead that a number of their fans are savages that can’t control themselves.  Yes you can station more police at Villa Park but what’s going to happen to the people who live in the surrounding area? How are you going to police every nearby street to ensure public safety? Whether you agree with it or not, there are more than a few houses with Palestine flags hanging from the windows in Aston – how do you see this playing out if/when Maccabi fans on their way to the ground walk past?",
      "To those that say “banning all fans is unfair to those who just want to support their team”, I don’t disagree with you but the moronic element don’t exactly wear badges or uniforms so what else do you do? Matches behind closed doors is one option, but then you’d have to do that for every game Maccabi play in Europe so why even take part?",
      "I honestly and truly believe that this decision has been made in the interests of public safety and for no other reason.  As I type this email, the government are “trying to find a way to reverse the ban” – assuming they are successful in doing so, I expect each and every one of them to be back on TV the following morning to be held responsible for making it happen and the carnage that will undoubtedly follow, which of course they won’t.  This is the equivalent of holding a lit match over a bucket of petrol, it’s really not going to end well at all.\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (Wondering how many of these politicians will be at Villa Park to see the match in person….)",
      "",
      "With the news that the West Midlands Police have decided that no Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will be allowed to attend the Europa league match against Aston Villa for safety concerns, has football now got a major antisemitism problem?",

      "In a country where we debate microaggressions and perceived threat of a national flag, where does actually being barred from attending football sit? As we all know it starts with antisemitism (Jews being the smallest of minorities in England circa 300k) and then other groups will be next…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘launched a bid’ for an Arsenal target, while another possible transfer hinges on one condition.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils were very active in the transfer market as club chiefs sanctioned a significant squad overhaul.",
      "This was required following a dire season in 2024/25, with Man Utd finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim was given huge backing to build a squad suited to his 3-4-3 system, with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senna Lammens their most notable additions as part of a £230m summer spend.",
      "It’s unclear whether these signings have been successful, as Man Utd still look miles away from competing for major trophies.",
      "The Red Devils are still lacking in several departments, but they will likely prioritise signing young up-and-coming talents in the upcoming transfer windows.",
      "READ: Amorim will sacrifice three academy kids ‘on the cheap’ to Newcastle after Ratcliffe pop",
      "Now, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man Utd have ‘launched a bid’ for Porto ‘jewel’ Victor Froholdt.",
      "The value of United’s reported bid is not mentioned, but the Denmark international has an 85 million euro (£74m) release clause in his current contract. The report claims Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are also interested.",
      "The 19-year-old centre-midfielder joined Porto in the summer for around £16m from FC Copenhagen and has four goal involvements in eight Liga Portugal appearances this season.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The Portuguese club considers him a key player for the future and has secured him a contract until 2030 with a buyout clause of around €85 million.",
      "‘However, the player’s meteoric rise and the attention he’s garnering from England’s top clubs could accelerate things. Manchester United and Tottenham have shown the most interest, and in recent weeks Arsenal have also reportedly joined the list of suitors.’",
      "The Red Devils could certainly do with signing a centre-midfielder and Sporting Lisbon standout Morten Hjulmand has been heavily linked with a potential move to Old Trafford over the past year.",
      "Hjulmand worked with Amorim and Sporting Lisbon, with it suggested that they could reunite at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has pointed out that the Red Devils face competition from Serie A giants Juventus for Hjulmand.",
      "Di Marzio has also claimed that Man Utd’s move for Hjulmand hinges on Amorim’s future.",
      "He claimed: “In relation to United, it is about whether Amorim is fired or not.",
      "“Amorim loves him and Juventus is also interested in him. This summer, Juventus could not spend €50-60m on his position because they needed strikers.”"

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has picked out three Red Devils stars who are “not good enough”, while Ruben Amorim is “doomed”.",
      "Scholes never minces his words when speaking on Man Utd and he has been particularly outspoken following the launch of his new podcast with Nicky Butt and Paddy McGuinness.",
      "It’s been easy for Scholes and Co. to target Man Utd in recent weeks as Amorim‘s side have endured a poor start to this season, sitting tenth in the Premier League after three losses in seven. They have also suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "The pressure on Amorim somewhat eased following United’s 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break, though he will be back under immense scrutiny if his side loses to Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "United’s poor recruitment is one reason for their woes post-Sir Alex Ferguson, with Scholes and Butt hitting out at the club for signing Casemiro for around £70m.",
      "“We got sucked into that one, and there’s been quite a few like that,” Scholes said on Casemiro in an interview with The Times.",
      "READ: Amorim will sacrifice three academy kids ‘on the cheap’ to Newcastle after Ratcliffe pop",
      "Nicky Butt added: “Real Madrid don’t let their best players go.",
      "“[Raphaël] Varane and Casemiro were both unbelievable players [earlier] in their career.",
      "“They’ve done more than I’ve ever done, so it’s difficult to have a go at them, but Real Madrid don’t sell their top players to a European rival in Man United.”",
      "In the same interview, Scholes ‘brutally’ claimed Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire are also no longer “physically good enough” to compete in the Premier League.",
      "“Shaw, Maguire, Casemiro, they’ve all been great players, but they’re at a stage of their career now where you get found out in the Premier League if you’re not physically good enough,” Scholes added.",
      "“Their bodies are not athletic enough, they’re not strong enough, they’re not quick enough. They’ve dropped to a level where they can’t cope with what’s needed in the Premier League.",
      "“Every player in the Premier League is an absolute machine. They’ve got five per cent body fat, they can run, they’re strong, they can head it. Manchester United are carrying two or three players that are just not capable of living with it.”",
      "The two pundits have also explained why they think Amorim is ‘doomed’ at Man Utd, with Scholes claiming that the results have not been good enough.",
      "“It [Amorim’s sacking], is going to happen sooner or later. I can’t see it turning around,” Butt claimed.",
      "On Amorim, Scholes added: “If you don’t win games, you [Amorim] will lose your job. It’s getting to that point now.”",
      "Butt, meanwhile, has raised a “fact” on Amorim’s system as he’s “made a rod for his own back”.",
      "“If me and Scholesy were in charge, we’d say, right our job’s on the line here and we’ve got to get some wins somehow,” Butt said.",
      "“And it’s not working, the system, so my thought would be, let’s go and get two or three results any way we can, but he’s gone so far now [by advocating the system], that he can’t go back.",
      "“He’s made a rod for his own back. Does he think he can turn it around? Or does he want to go back to Portugal or Spain or another club? I don’t know the answer to that. But it’s looking to me like it [Amorim leaving] is going to happen sooner or later.",
      "“The manager seems to be so obsessed with playing this way and if he keeps it up, and does not win games, he won’t have a chance to do it because he’s going to be gone. It’s a fact.”",
      "Man Utd legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are unhappy about the Man City-fication of the Old Trafford hierarchy in recent years.",
      "Pundit Alan Shearer has named his Liverpool-Manchester United combined XI and has omitted Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes insists that England have “no chance of winning the World Cup” without Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is very likely to be completed, while INEOS are ‘in agreement’ over another deal.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker reckons defender Luke Shaw is likely to cost the Red Devils when they face Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have disagreed who the best in the league is, with the former picking an Arsenal man “every day of the week.”"

      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:24, UK",
      "Harry Maguire stunned Liverpool as his 84th-minute header clinched Manchester United's first win at Anfield since 2016 and condemned the hosts to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "Maguire guided in Bruno Fernandes's cross just six minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out a controversial opening goal from Bryan Mbeumo only 62 seconds into a thrilling contest.",
      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Liverpool: Mamardashvili (5), Bradley (6), Van Dijk (5), Konate (6), Kerkez (5), Gravenberch (6), Szoboszlai (7), Mac Allister (6), Salah (5), Gakpo (7), Isak (5).\n\n\nSubs: Jones (6), Wirtz (6), Ekitike (6), Chiesa (7), Frimpong (6).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), De Ligt (7), Maguire (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (5), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (8), Amad (8), Mount (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Sesko (6), Yoro (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Harry Maguire",
      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything. Sometimes you play more with the ball, other days you play without the ball.",
      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",
      "\"We have not given our fans enough days like today, so it has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points.",
      "\"It is not just three points to the club and to the boys. I have been coming to this ground for seven years now and to not get three points has been tough. It's for the fans and I hope they had a great night tonight.",
      "\"We won't get carried away because we can't afford that as a club, we will use it as motivation.\"",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Ruben Amorim had cited his set-piece threat and he delivered.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",
      "\"He needed something, the pressure was building but a win at Anfield is huge.",
      "\"It's a great place for Manchester United to win a game of football.",
      "\"It's a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag.",
      "\"They have to make sure this is the start of something.",
      "\"Harry Maguire and his team-mates will be proud tonight.\"",
      "\"We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost.\"",
      "\"It is an interesting time because we have to stick together, not just us as players but as a club and the fans who want us to win.\"",

      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",

      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",

      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",

      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "Player ratings as Man Utd beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield to claim first back-to-back league wins under Ruben Amorim; Harry Maguire headed winning goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's acrimonious opener; Liverpool have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2014",
      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Sunday 19 October 2025 21:39, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Bruno Fernandes says Manchester United need stability and the players believe Ruben Amorim is the right man to bring the club back to where it belongs.",
      "United have lurched from one extreme to another this season, suffering chastening defeats at Manchester City and Brentford, but the captain was glad to see Amorim get the public backing of minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the international break.",
      "\"Sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture and as a group of players we believe that the manager can help this club to get back where it belongs.\"",
      "He added: \"If Sir Jim sees it the same way as the players, that the manager is the right one for the job, it makes it better that we have two groups of people looking in the same way.\"",
      "Victory over Sunderland before the international break brought a renewed sense of optimism to Old Trafford, but another no-show performance would likely put Amorim back in the spotlight, even after Ratcliffe vowed to give him three years.",
      "Fernandes expects nothing less and says his team-mates must rise above the external noise if they are to succeed at the club.",
      "\"Any manager that comes here will be one game away from a crisis,\" said the United captain.",
