      "Besiktas have announced the sacking of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer just hours after failing to qualify for the Conference League. The Turkish giants were beaten 1-0 by Swiss side Lausanne-Sport in the second leg of their play-off tie in Istanbul on Thursday.",
      "The result means that Besiktas won't be involved in European competition this season. Solskjaer's side previously failed to make it into the Europa League via the play-offs but did win their opening game of the Super Lig campaign, beating Eyupspor 2-1.",
      "Bestikas chiefs have wielded the axe eight months after hiring the Manchester United legend. In a statement, the club said: \"Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting.",
      "\"Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjaer for his services to date. We respectfully submit this for the public's information.",
      "Solskjaer, 52, won more than half of his 29 games in charge, helping Besiktas secure a fourth-place finish last term. Having been sacked by United in November 2021, the Norwegian had been out of coaching for three years prior to his appointment.",
      "Besiktas drew the first leg of their clash with Lausanne-Sport, who are owned by Manchester United part-owners INEOS, 1-1 last week. When the teams met for round two, Besiktas were the favourites to advance.",
      "But a goal from Nathan Butler-Oyedeji on the brink of half-time left them stunned. Besiktas' night went from bad to worse when Felix Uduokhai was shown a straight red card less than 60 seconds into the second half.",
      "Solskjaer made a series of change in a bid to swing the momentum but their Swiss opponents saw the game out and will compete in the Conference League this season. In the line-up for the hosts was former Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista, Wilfred Ndidi - who recently signed from Leicester - ex-West Ham midfielder Joao Maria and former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham.",

      "Manchester United have agreed a £40million deal with Chelsea for winger Alejandro Garnacho. The two clubs have agreed a fixed £40m fee, ending Garnacho's outcast status at United, after his falling out with boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "As part of the deal, the fourth largest sale United's history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria, the Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee. United dug their heels in and stood firm on their valuation of Garnacho, having rejected Chelsea's initial offer of £25m.",
      "Garnacho was left out of United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao. That led to the 20-year-old winger being exiled by Amorim and omitted from United's pre-season tour of the US and made to train in isolation with fellow outcasts Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "A frustrated Garnacho said after the loss to Spurs: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "His brother, Roberto, fanned the flames by stating on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus.\"",
      "Garnacho wasn't involved in United's opening three games of the season, starting with a 1-0 loss at home to Arsenal. The Red Devils then followed up the defeat with a 1-1 draw away to Fulham on Sunday.",
      "That was before the biggest humiliation of Amorim's tenure. Wednesday saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup by fourth-tier side Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim's men were 2-0 down until the closing stages, as Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire scored to send the game to penalties. But misses from Mbeumo and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha saw Grimbsy win 12-11 on penalties, booking their place in the second round.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim could be set to suffer the same fate as Erik ten Hag if Thursday morning's events are anything to go by. The under-pressure Manchester United boss arrived at the club's training ground at the crack of dawn, mere hours after overseeing one of the club's most humiliating nights in recent memory.",
      "On Wednesday, United were sensationally dumped out of the EFL Cup by League 2 side Grimsby Town - a shock result that will no doubt rank among the biggest upsets of the season. The tie ended 2-2 after normal time before Amorim's side collapsed in a tense penalty shootout, leaving his future at the club hanging by a thread.",
      "Determined to respond, the Portuguese coach arrived at Carrington before 7am, intent on salvaging something from the wreckage. But the gesture carried uncomfortable echoes of his predecessor, Ten Hag, who made the same show of defiance last year in the wake of a bruising 3-0 defeat by Tottenham - a moment that ultimately proved the beginning of the end.",
      "Like Amorim, Ten Hag began his final season under a cloud after a stuttering end to the previous campaign. Results never improved, and for weeks it felt like when, not if, he'd be sacked, before the axe finally fell in November.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to forge a different path, but the omens are bleak. United are winless after three games, and his dismal 35 per cent win rate as United boss suggests something has to give soon.",
      "He cut a dejected figure on the touchline at Blundell Park, especially after Grimsby surged into a 2-0 lead before the interval. Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire dragged United back into the contest with second-half goals, but the comeback unravelled in the shootout, where summer recruits Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both missed efforts.",
      "When asked what went wrong on the night, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through. Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit. I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.\"",
      "After the game, the team bus rolled back into Carrington just after 1am. Players and staff, Amorim among them, collected their cars and slipped away into the night. But while most headed home for rest, the United manager was back at work only hours later.",
      "He arrived nearly four hours before his squad was due to report for training at 11am, throwing himself straight into preparations for Saturday's showdown with Burnley. The match already carries the weight of a must-win: United sit perilously close to the relegation zone, a haunting echo of last season's struggles.",
      "A victory would offer the club a much-needed exhale heading into the international break. Anything less, however, risks souring the mood once again - perhaps bitterly enough to leave Amorim going the way of Ten Hag.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"I just want to say sorry to our fans, I have nothing to say anymore about the performance,\" Amorim said. \"When everything is so important in our club and you try to do everything.",

      "United, were two goals down against League Two opposition after just 30 minutes as Andre Onana produced a poor display on his return to the starting line-up. Charles Vernam beat Onana at his near post before Tyrell Warren capitalised when the former Inter Milan star failed to deal with a corner.",
      "Amorim's side found their way back into the tie thanks to goals from Harry Maguire and Bryan Mbeumo. The latter was the figure to miss the crucial penalty in sudden death to bring the night to a close however.",
      "Amorim was left questioning his team following the match. \"If we don't show up, you can feel that something has to change and you are not going to change 22 players again,\" he said.",
      "And similar questions may have seen, United make a change to their profile on X. In the hours afterwards, the message which once read: \"Work hard and smile, you're at Manchester United!\" was changed to: \"The home of Manchester United.\"",
      "The message that was replaced was a quote from former club receptionist Kath Phipps, who died in December 2014. Phipps was an iconic figure at the club who had worked at the club since the 1960s.",
      "United's new rejuvinated Carrington training ground even bears the words, with a plaque acknowledging Phipps in place.

      "Ruben Amorim will hold showdown talks with the Manchester United hierarchy following Saturday's must-win game against Burnley. Amorim is under increasing pressure after a poor start to the new season reached a new low with Wednesday's humiliating League Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "United, who ended last season in 15th place in the Premier League, have taken one point from their opening two league games this season and are currently languishing in 16th position. Failure to beat newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford would turn the heat up on Amorim, who admitted 'we will have time to decide things' after Saturday's game, in what seemed a clear reference to his role.",
      "The 40-year-old Portuguese head coach will hold talks with club officials during the international break, having cast fresh doubt over his United future with his blunt remarks following the Grimsby debacle. Amorim is under contract until June 2027, with the option for an additional year, but has won just seven of his 29 Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "While there is a reluctance to sack Amorim after less than a year in charge, there is an acceptance among the United hierarchy that he must oversee an immediate upturn in results to carry on. United chief executive Omar Berrada drove the appointment of Amorim, rejecting former sporting director Dan Ashworth, who favoured Thomas Frank, Gareth Southgate and Marco Silva.",
      "Berrada's reputation hangs on Amorim succeeding at United, which is why the former Manchester City executive is willing to give the 40-year-old every chance of turning the situation around. But with no European football this season, United out of the League Cup and the FA Cup their only chance of winning a trophy, Amorim must turn the team's fortunes around to keep his job.",
      "United face a frantic last four days of the transfer window as the look to recruit a goalkeeper to take over from error-prone duo Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, with Royal Antwerp's £17million-rated Senne Lammens their top target.",
      "Amorim is also in the market to sign a new midfielder before Monday's transfer deadline, although his first-choice target, Brighton's Carlos Baleba, is likely to prove too costly at £100m. United are also trying to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia before deadline day, with all four still training away from the first-team squad.",
      "A permanent deal for Antony to join Real Betis is understood to be close, while Garnacho is holding out for a move to Chelsea, who are willing to pay £35m plus add-ons for him. United wanted £50m for the 20-year-old winger but are likely to accept Chelsea’s offer to end the saga over the winger's future.",
      "United sources say there are no plans to jettison Amorim so early in the season and believe emotion got the better of him in the immediate aftermath of the Grimsby exit.",

      "Ruben Amorim could defy a long-standing Manchester United tradition famously upheld by Sir Alex Ferguson if he allows Kobbie Mainoo to leave. The out-of-favour midfielder could soon be moved on, possibly before Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "A £45m sale has been mooted, which would certainly boost the PSR balance sheets. As he came through United's academy, it would be registered as pure profit. However, it would also prematurely end what was once a promising career at the club.",
      "Mainoo, then just a teenager, made his mark in the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, playing a key role in United's FA Cup triumph. His performances caught the eye of Gareth Southgate, who included him in his Euro 2024 squad, where Mainoo featured in every knockout match as England reached the final.",
      "Sir Alex lauded Mainoo ahead of the 2024/25 season, tipping him to continue his upward trajectory. Discussing the impact of Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, the legendary United manager emphasised the importance of nurturing young talent. Speaking to TikToker Jamal Niaz, he said: \"It's the foundation, isn't it?",
      "\"It's the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They're young. What they're showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first team, and not be daunted by it.",
      "\"In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have. It's a distinction in human beings, some have the will to be that [fearless at a young age].\"",
      "However, Mainoo's progress has hit the buffers under Amorim, while discussions over a new contract have stalled. Last season, he endured injury problems and struggled to hold down a regular spot in the team when fit.",
      "He was handed a start in Wednesday's Carabao Cup disaster at Grimsby Town. While he wasn't one of United's poorest performers, he did little to strengthen his case for regular first-team football.",
      "Amorim has said all the right things regarding the youngster's ability, but amid United's ongoing struggles, no player is guaranteed to stay, particularly one who doesn't seem to feature in the manager's immediate plans.",
      "Up to 10 clubs are interested in Mainoo, with the Daily Mail connecting Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Napoli with potential moves. Newcastle United have also been linked with the 20-year-old. Nevertheless, any departure – whether imminently or down the line – would frustrate many United supporters, and presumably Ferguson.",

      "If Ruben Amorim thought a summer would act as a reset with his Manchester United woes now behind him, then Wednesday night proved that he was sorely mistaken.",
      "For the first time in the club's history the Red Devils were beaten by a team from the fourth tier as Grimsby dumped them out of the Carabao Cup. An embarrassing night could have been even worse, they were trailing 2-0 at half-time, but rallied to force penalties before losing 12-11 in the shootout.",
      "It means from their opening three games in all competitions they have lost to Arsenal, drawn with Fulham and been outdone by a team sitting fourth in League Two.",
      "Amorim knew he needed a fast start after a poor opening few months to his tenure, but that has not happened. Any feel good factor that came from the dominant display against Arsenal has firmly disappeared and the dark clouds are gathering.",
      "Ineos know they got their first managerial call wrong when they backed Erik ten Hag, only to sack him months later. Amorim was their first hire and they're determined to prove that they can get these decisions right. It means the Portuguese coach will be given time, but only so much of it.",
      "The bookies fancy him to be gone before the season draws to a close. United returned back from Grimsby at 1am on Thursday morning and the manager was back at Carrington just six hours later at 7am to get to work following the latest humiliation - the players then arrived at 11am.",
      "A Manchester derby at the Etihad is just over a fortnight away and a humiliating defeat there could be terminal. Amorim has continued to look for answers and he'll again have to get back to the drawing board as we look at what he can fix.",
      "Might seem crazy to think given more than £200million was spent on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but the team's frontline is certainly not humming. There's been the odd positive sign, particularly from Cunha. But no attack that cost that much to assemble should need more than 250 minutes to score its first goal of the season.",
      "Arsenal kept them scoreless, Fulham gifted them a brief lead on Sunday via an own goal and it took 75 minutes for the United attack to breach the Grimsby defence on Wednesday night. Many thought as if the investment in the attack would solve itself, but that doesn't look to be the case.",
      "Ironically, there were 13 penalties taken by United players at Blundell Park. The only two men to miss spot kicks were the new arrivals Cunha and Mbeumo. The ex-Wolves man missed the penalty that would've sealed the game and Mbeumo's effort crashed off the bar to send Grimsby through.",
      "Amorim cannot afford for two of his most potent attacking weapons to see their heads drop. He needs to ensure that the added pressure that comes with playing on the red side of Manchester doesn't weigh them down. Cunha has been arguably their best player so far and the team can ill-afford for their attack to be blunted.",
      "Yes it is harsh, but the errors will not stop from Andre Onana. He was responsible for another blunder and the cries for United to change their No 1 are only gathering volume. Time is running out but their need for a new goalkeeper is potentially now larger than their need was for a striker this summer.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has still not left PSG and he's been linked with an Old Trafford switch. It remains to be seen just how much budget United have left, but they've already spent considerable amounts given Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed they were weeks from going bust. Clearly there's cash somewhere - and they need to spend it on a goalkeeper.",
      "No striker who costs £74m should watch all nine of his outfield team-mates step up before him in a penalty shootout, but that was the reality on Wednesday. Sesko is either a man already struggling for confidence or one fearing failure. Neither are ideal. United have seen how slow starts for strikers can result in them never finding their feet - Rasmus Hojlund a case in point.",
      "Amorim has left the Slovenian on the bench for United's opening two games. He may cite the need to get him up to speed, but every other major striker who has moved to the Premier League has been thrown straight into the fold. Sesko didn't paint a good picture for United fans by stepping up so late in the shootout, but Amorim has to play his part in making the 22-year-old feel like the main man that they need him to be.",
      "This may well fall on deaf ears. For months Amorim has claimed United hired him off the back of his Sporting Lisbon success, which owed itself to his philosophy. But it is so clear that this set of players are not getting to grips with what he wants them to do - even if he is loyal to the end to his beliefs.",
      "The gaps and the space down the flanks were continuously exploited by a team in League Two on Wednesday. So no wonder Premier League outifts have had such joy. Amorim does appear more than willing to go down with his ship, but he needs to decide whether he'd rather the sack or to make some tweaks to his system.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "If Ruben Amorim is getting ready to pack it in as Manchester United boss, then his actions early on Thursday morning suggested otherwise. The morning after the horrendous night before, Amorim was back at his desk at the club's Carrington training base looking to move on.",
      "The Portuguese has just a few hours' sleep after United's shock defeat to Grimsby at Blundell Park, the Red Devils crashing out of the Carabao Cup on penalties after a horrific display that saw them fall 2-0 down, pull it back to 2-2 late on, only to then lose on spot-kicks.",
      "After their humiliation, the team arrived back at Carrington just after 1am. Players and coaching staff, Amorim included, picked up their cars and headed home, but the United boss was back to work just hours later. He arrived at the training complex shortly after 7am on Thursday morning. The full squad reported for training for 11am, with no shortage of glum faces among them, and will now have two days to prepare to face Burnley in the Premier League.",
      "The players who started against Grimsby are undergoing recovery work today as they prepare for Burnley, while those who started on the bench or were not included in the squad complete a training session. Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were rested for the trip to Grimsby and are set to return on Saturday.",
      "When asked what went wrong after Grimsby, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through. Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit.",

      "Rio Ferdinand insists that Kobbie Mainoo needs to step up his game at Manchester United, dismissing Paul Scholes' \"wild\" comparison of the youngster to Zinedine Zidane.",
      "Mainoo was given his first start of the season in United's Carabao Cup second round defeat by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night. Despite a promising start, the Red Devils found themselves 2-0 down before half-time, with a late equaliser from Harry Maguire taking the match to penalties.",
      "The cup upset was completed when Bryan Mbeumo hit the bar with his spot kick, resulting in a 12-11 defeat for United. Mainoo played the full 90 minutes and set up Mbeumo for United's first goal, but the loss may have done little to convince manager Ruben Amorim to include the 20-year-old in his future plans.",
      "During a recent episode of the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, co-host Joel Beya brought up comments made by Scholes, who claimed Mainoo was far superior to himself at the same age. Beya said: \"Kobbie Mainoo has been a ghost man throughout this period.",
      "\"We've got the likes of Paul Scholes saying, 'He's the nearest thing I've seen to Zidane in taking the ball, receiving the ball, cruising past people. I've read a few comparisons between me and him and this kid. Don't waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.'",
      "\"If I'm Kobbie Mainoo bro, and you're not playing me and obviously the fans are still cheering for Amorim to stay, I could be looking for another club at the end of the season?\"",
      "However, Ferdinand wasn't entirely convinced by this argument. He described his former team-mate's comments as \"a bit wild\" when drawing parallels between Mainoo and the French football legend.",
      "Beya mentioned that Ferdinand had likened the young midfielder to Clarence Seedorf, prompting the former England captain to reply: \"I think he's more of a Seedorf player, that's what I think. I think his style of football is more Seedorf.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the Scholes-Zidane-Mainoo comparison, Ferdinand said: \"But Scholes saying he is 10 times the player he was, and I think you've got to remember that telling number there at 19. At 19.",
      "\"That's what he's saying, Scholesy wasn't developed yet, still had fantastic potential, but Scholes had asthma, he couldn't finish games properly at a young age and stuff. He wasn't nowhere near the player he became at 19.",
      "\"At 19, this kid is playing in European championships, do you know what I mean? It's not like he's a kid who was there and you're going, 'Oh, he's just in the youth team, just got out of the youth team or the under-21s.'",
      "\"He was playing for England, starting for England. Scholesy at 19 wasn't doing that. So that's where he's talking about the comparison. But listen, I'm a massive fan of Kobbie.\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to detail just how Mainoo should be pushing for a start in Amorim's side, adding that he hopes the chance doesn't come if the young star isn't prepared. He said: \"But he has to work out, 'What do I need to do to get back in his team?'",
      "\"And we've all had these moments in our careers where you're like, 'S*** man, I'm not playing. What do I do?' Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, 'What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?' Right. He's going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",
      "\"Every day I go to work. I play up against whoever, Bruno [Fernandes] etc, and I start dominating them. Just that's the type of mentality and mindset he has to go with. And then when the chance comes to play, take it with both hands.",
      "\"Now his argument right now will be I'm not getting the chance to take it. And that's a fair argument. But what I would say is do not let the chance come and you're not ready. So train hard, be focused.\"",
      "Mainoo appeared to have been handed his opportunity on Wednesday evening in the Carabao Cup, and many might contend that he compensated for falling two goals behind by providing one assist and converting his penalty. But Beya reckons that the midfielder is unlikely to receive many more favourable decisions under Amorim, owing to the Portuguese boss's rigid system that he \"refuses to change.\"",
      "He added: \"I agree Rio, but I also think he is going to be someone suffering because of this system that Amorim plays and he refuses to change it. You know like it's you've got the talent there man no one can tell me that Kobbie Mainoo cannot play football, no one can tell me that boy isn't brilliant.",
      "\"One of the best talents I've ever seen, and you're telling me for whatever reason he couldn't get minutes yesterday [against Fulham]? He couldn't even come off [the bench]?\"",
      "According to The Athletic, United are content with Mainoo's presence at the club and have no plans to let him leave before the September 1 deadline. However, rumours suggest that the 20-year-old's market value has plummeted from £70million to £45m in recent weeks, and could dip even further before the transfer window closes.",

      "Alan Shearer claims Manchester United are \"a million miles\" away from where they need to be - but they've now committed to backing Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese's rocky 10-month Old Trafford tenure stooped to a new low on Wednesday night as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by League Two Grimsby.",
      "Betfair Ambassador Shearer believes it's difficult to establish whether there is light at the end of the tunnel, stating: \"As soon as they went all in for Amorim and they got him straight away, rather than waiting until the end of the season, they were always going to have to back him. They have backed him and it's now up to him to get them back into some sort of respectable position.",
      "\"They've spent an absolute fortune already this summer but they still need to spend. Whether they can get in what they want in this window or whether they're going to have to wait, we'll have to wait and see but I think it's going to be really tough.",
      "\"You look at what the top four or five have spent and then there's the chasing pack, maybe Man United might and I say might, be one of them but even still, they will find it tough to get anywhere near the top five this season. They're a million miles away from where they were or where they want to be.\"",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana's position has become untenable but Shearer feels Amorim also needs to revive the form of captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "United made a huge push to keep the 30-year-old, who was the subject of an eye-watering offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal earlier this summer worth around £200million over a three-year period.",
      "Since opting to stay put, Fernandes has looked a shadow of his former self in a deeper midfield role. Shearer continued: \"I'm not sure where Man United would be without him.",
      "\"If it wasn't for him last season, they might not even be in the Premier League. He was their best player, clearly but I don't see him as a sitting midfielder.",
      "\"Maybe Amorim sees something different to everything I see and what everyone else sees. He's best suited with a bit of freedom but they've brought [Matheus] Cunha to do that role, I guess. They have to find a position for Bruno.",
      "\"With regards to his penalty, I wouldn't criticise anyone for missing from 12-yards as I did too. It won't be the last he misses, you have to step up to take them and put up with the noise when you miss them.\"",
      "Alan Shearer was speaking at the launch of Betfair’s Safe Sub – if your player goes off, it's not over yet (selected leagues/markets).",

      "Daily Mirror Manchester Football Correspondent, covering Manchester United and Manchester City. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "Suddenly the Erik ten Hag era, which yielded two trophies and European football in successive seasons, does not seem such a blot on Manchester United's recent troubled history.",
      "The same cannot be said of his successor, Ruben Amorim, who has dragged the once great club to its lowest point of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era in the space of just nine months. After last season's 15th-placed finish in the Premier League, United's lowest since relegation in the 1973-74 campaign, Amorin knew he could not afford a poor start to the new term.",
      "But one point from United's opening two league games was followed by Wednesday's abject League Cup exit to League Two Grimsby, which has increased the pressure on Amorim. The Portuguese head coach admitted as much on United's pre-season tour of America this summer, when he conceded he had used up all of the credit he had in the bank when he arrived.",
      "Now, just three games into the new season, Amorim faces a must-win fixture at home to newly-promoted Burley on Saturday with fans starting to turn on him after backing him last season.",
      "With no European football this season, Amorin said it would give him more time to work with United's players on his much-maligned and controversial 3-4-3 system, to which he is wedded and will not deviate from.",
      "But after an encouraging display in their opening game of the season at home to Arsenal, despite losing 1-0, United reverted to type against Fulham and Grimsby, with disjointed, lacklustre performances that confirmed the players remain unwilling or unable to adapt to Amorim's demands.",
      "Amorim said as much himself in the immediate aftermath of the penalty shoot-out defeat at Blundell Park, claiming “my players spoke really loud today about what they want” and admitting “something has to change – you are not going to change 22 players again”.",
      "That last remark hinted at Amorim considering his own future, just as he did towards the end of last season, when he admitted he would walk away from United without compensation, if the club hierarchy felt it was in the best interests of both parties.",
      "Given how much United have invested in Amorim, backing him to the tune of £207million in this summer's transfer window and sticking with him and his contentious system, despite no evidence of it yielding success, there is a reluctance to fire him and start all over again with a seventh permanent manager since Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "But if United continue to labour and fail to beat Burnley at Old Trafford tomorrow, the international break will present co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox with some major decisions to make with regard to Amorim.",
      "They got it wrong last summer, by sticking with Ten Hag and allowing him to spend £200m, only to sack him nine games into the season, with United down in 14th place. United are currently in 16th place, with no more margin for error for Amorim if he wants to keep his job.",
      "The 40-year-old may ultimately make the decision himself, as he suggested last season and hinted at in his brutally honest post-match pitchside interview at Grimsby. Amorim's charisma and candour has served to shield him from more criticism than he has received, with seven wins from 29 league matches an unacceptable return for any manager, let alone one at a club with such huge resources and expectation.",
      "United's run to last season's Europa League final – which they lost to Tottenham – masked the glaring deficiencies that still plague the team and have not been addressed in the transfer window.",
      "A new goalkeeper and central midfielder were priorities, as was a striker, but having addressed the latter position with the £70m signing of Benjamin Sesko – who looks way short of the level required – they are stuck with error-prone Andre Onana in goal and a midfield that gets overrun far too easily.",
      "There are still four days left in the transfer window for United to address both positions, to give them a chance of rescuing their season and Amorim a chance of staying in charge, but time is running out for both and the clock is ticking.",

      "\"They spoke really loud. I think that [the same issues] is a problem. When you lose and see something new, it is different. We have to say sorry to the fans. The support that they gave us with all of the defeats, I just have to say I'm really sorry.",
      "\"I think they [the players] gave the response on the pitch today so I don't have to talk about that. We have a game at the weekend and then we have two weeks and we will sort things out.\"",
      "And Darren Stanton, who is also known as the human lie detector, analysed Amorim's body language in his post-match interviews and says the result left him \"in a state of shock\". Stanton told OLBG : \"His comments about his own players speaking loudly for him was very interesting.",
      "\"He almost seems in a state of shock. He is a deeply disappointed man and I dont think he fully understands what was going on in that match. We see evidence of pure frustration plus anger and disappointment.",
      "\"He spent most of his post-match interviews with his head dipped down. That's also a sign of shame. We see the anger in how his eyes come together, pulled down and the furrow lines in his forehead.",
      "\"When he says the team has been getting better and improving I feel that he's suggesting his players have thrown it against Grimsby. You feel he's not far off claiming his plans are being sabotaged, like his team is throwing him under a bus, even though it means they're losing these games.\"",
      "Stanton believes Amorim will \"do his darndest to try and resolve the situation\", but warns that he is \"not going to allow himself to continually be thrown under the bus\".",
      "He added: \"I think he's going to try and address whatever issues are going on in the locker room with the team but it could come to a point where he looks at it and goes, you know what, this just isn't working for me.",
      "\"I've tried my best. You're not prepared to play ball. You're not prepared to play my way and work with me and my ideas. He has nowhere else to go otherwise but I think, from what we've seen of Ruben so far, that he is going to do his darndest to try and resolve the situation and get to the bottom of what's going on at United, both with the individual players and the collective.",
      "\"But I also don't think he's a man that's gonna suck it up forever. He's just got his professional integrity as well. All football managers have egos. I don't think he's going to roll over and allow himself and his career to be tarnished, and he wants to work at the highest levels after this job too.",
      "\"If he walks it won't look good on him so he'll try and turn it around to the best of his ability but he's not going to allow himself to continually be thrown under the bus. It will get to a point where he will walk, I believe.\"",

      "Manchester United have just suffered one of their most embarrassing defeats – and now their proud history could be diluted.",
      "United were beaten by Grimsby on penalties in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. They went 2-0 down inside 30 minutes against the League Two side and needed late goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire to take the tie to penalties.",
      "Matheus Cunha missed the chance to win it for United before Mbeumo hit the crossbar in sudden death as Grimsby prevailed 12-11 on spot-kicks. It was a miserable night for United, who are running out of time to improve their squad in the summer transfer window.",
      "Wednesday saw a first start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, who had been an unused substitute for the opening two Premier League matches. Mainoo has been frustrated with his situation at his boyhood club and has made it clear that he is open to leaving before the deadline on Monday.",
      "Ruben Amorim considers Mainoo to be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in United’s midfield. The club have fielded interest from 10 different clubs for Mainoo and could be tempted to cash in on the 20-year-old.",
      "While selling a homegrown player would help their situation in terms of the profit and sustainability rules, it would also risk endangering a proud club record. United have included at least one academy player in their matchday squad in every game since October 1937 – a staggering run of 4,324 matches.",
      "But the sale of Mainoo would see the departure of their most high-profile academy graduate. Tyler Fredricson also started against Grimsby, but was hauled off at half-time and is far from guaranteed a spot in the squad.",
      "Fredricson and Mainoo were the only academy graduates in the squad at Grimsby and the exits of Marcus Rashford, Toby Collyer, Dan Gore and Ethan Wheatley on loan this summer has further weakened their connection with the academy. No other academy graduate has made the first-team squad so far this season.",
      "Amorim did take a look at a group of youngsters during pre-season, including 14-year-old JJ Gabriel, but has been reluctant to promote them further yet. The Portuguese boss is well aware of United’s history of producing top young players, but is fighting for his job less than a year into his stint as manager.",
      "United have been dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round and are yet to win in the Premier League, having lost 1-0 to Arsenal and drawn 1-1 with Fulham. They finished 15th in the Premier League last season and have no European football to look forward to this campaign after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",

      "The hits just keep coming at Manchester United as pressure continues to build on boss Ruben Amorim. The latest knockout blow came on Wednesday at Blundell Park, where his side succumbed on penalties in the second round of the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town, marking their earliest exit from the competition in over a decade.",
      "The 40-year-old has only been at the helm of the Red Devils for nine months, but it's been the most challenging period of his career and for many of his players. The lows have been constant while the highs have practically been non-existent following his appointment to replace Erik ten Hag.",
      "While Amorim presents a cool and collected character when it comes to his media obligations, he's been known to have a fiery side. That aspect of his character came out in spades after United's 3-1 home defeat to Brighton last season.",
      "It was their sixth home defeat of the Premier League campaign and Amorim's fourth despite having been in the job for just over two months. Tensions certainly boiled over in the dressing room as it was reported Amorim smashed a TV screen while angrily venting at his squad.",
      "The TV, which he usually uses to explain tactics before kick-off and at half-time, was the unfortunate victim in Amorim losing his temper at his team, who were said to have remained seated during his furious rant.",
      "The January loss to the Seagulls certainly had an impact on Amorim, who didn't stop at the damaging of a TV in showing his frustration with what was yet another poor showing from his side.",
      "Having taken charge of 11 league games at that point, United had picked up just 11 points - and their dismal form caused Amorim to shockingly brand his side as the \"worst team in Manchester United history.\" In his post-match media conference, the Portuguese boss said: \"In [the past] 10 games in the Premier League, we won two.",
      "\"Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"",
      "He did, however, walk back his comments just days later as he attributed his bold comments to his relative youth as a manager. \"I’m a young guy and sometimes I make a mistake,\" Amorim said at his press conference ahead of the Europa League tie against. \"That’s why I don’t talk about it after the game.\"",
      "Upon Amorim's appointment in November, he took over a side in 13th with hopes that the decision to sack Ten Hag four months into the season could reignite what had been a struggling season.",
      "However, the 40-year-old could do little to stop United's poor form that continued to slip further under his stewardship. Amorim won just seven of his 27 league games in charge last season, leaving United to finish 15th with just 42 points.",
      "Not only was it their lowest league position since the 1989–90 season, but it was the fewest points they've collected in a top-flight season since they were last relegated back in 1973–74.",
      "In what was a horror debut season at Old Trafford, Amorim did lead the club to the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur. While a victory in Bilbao could have somewhat salvaged a historically bad season, it was the north London side that came out on top in a 1-0 win.",
      "The disappointment of their domestic campaign coupled with a European final defeat saw Amorim admit he'd walk away from the dugout if faith is lost in his ability to return United's status as one of football's biggest powers.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said Amorim after the final. \"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"",
      "The Red Devils endured one of the most memorable cupsets in history as they were knocked out on penalties by League Two side Grimsby, who could've won the game in normal time had they not surrended their 2-0 lead.",
      "Amorim didn't shy away from calling out his players after the defeat while hinting his future at Old Trafford could be left in peril. He revealed that talks will be made after their Premier League clash against Burnley on Saturday - their last game before the international break.",
      "He told ITV Sport: \"I think the players spoke really loudly about what they want today. Something has to change and you’re not going to change 22 players again.\" Talking about potential talks with United's hierarchy, Amorim said: \"Let’s focus on the next game and then we have time to think about things.",
      "\"We have a lot of debts with our fans so let’s focus on the game.\" Amorim then doubled down, adding: \"We have a job to do, a job to prepare and then we’ll stop and think things through.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Success in football can often hinge on a sliding doors moment, and it appears Liverpool's decision to appoint Arne Slot instead of Ruben Amorim was as crucial as any in their recent history. The pair's contrasting fortunes ever since coming to the Premier League couldn't be more opposite.",
      "After the shock announcement that Jurgen Klopp would leave Liverpool in January 2024, all eyes were on his successor. It's no secret that the hierarchy at the Reds were interested in then-Sporting CP head coach Ruben Amorim to take the reins at Anfield.",
      "Yet Liverpool opted for Feyenoord boss Slot, while United eventually moved for Amorim in November 2024 after sacking Erik ten Hag. There were several reasons why Liverpool chose the Dutchman over his Portuguese counterpart, with Amorim's rigid playing style said to be a major concern for Anfield officials.",
      "ESPN claimed that Amorim was snubbed, not only for his tactical inflexibility, but also due to the nearly £10million buy-out clause that Liverpool would have had to agree on in order to bring Amorim to Merseyside.",
      "Tensions over a perceived premature reporting of Liverpool's interest in Amorim also left the Anfield outfit irritated, according to The Athletic.",
      "Yet Liverpool’s hierarchy ultimately decided against Amorim as they felt his favoured 3-4-3 system would not suit the squad that Klopp had left behind, with the German often deploying a flat back four in a 4-3-3.",
      "Amorim's system – which can adjust into a 4-2-4 in transitions, a 5-2-3 when defending, and a 3-2-5 when attacking – was, and is, key to the manager’s ideals. However, Liverpool believed they didn't have the personnel to make a back three work, while Slot was already wedded to a back four thanks to his successful 4-2-4 approach in the Eredivisie.",
      "Bringing Amorim on board would have been a costly acquisition for the Reds, with a total overhaul of Liverpool's tried and tested formation required to realise Amorim's ambitions. The Athletic report also added that Liverpool had doubts about whether the 40-year-old's playing style would appeal to the Anfield crowd.",
      "Slot, meanwhile, has also claimed he was eventually the only one approached with the offer of the Liverpool job. That showed he was ultimately the first choice in the end, despite links to former Liverpool star Xabi Alonso too, who eventually left Bayer Leverkusen for Real Madrid this summer.",
      "United went ahead regardless of Liverpool's concerns and brought Amorim in, despite knowing the coaches' penchant for a back three.",
      "Fast forward to the 2025/2026 season, Slot is fast becoming an Anfield icon and Liverpool are the defending Premier League champions.",
      "Meanwhile, United are facing yet another crisis after the Red Devils were brutally dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "Amorim's once growing stock, built on two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting in 2022 and 2024, appears to be at an all time low after he steered United to 15th in the Premier League last season and saw his side lose the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur in May.",
      "Having won just 16 games for United out of 45, his win rate lies at a paltry 35.6%. For comparison, his rate at Sporting was 71%, while the man sacked for Amorim – Ten Hag – had a success rate of 56% at United upon his dismissal.",
      "It's not like there hasn't been funds available to Amorim for him to carve United into his own image. Patrick Dorgu joined for £29m in January, while this summer saw Matheus Cunha sign in a £62.5m deal.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was recently brought in for £71m. Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko is the latest recruit, costing United £74m, while Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven were signed at the turn of the year for a total of around £5m and it's believed they aren't done yet in this current transfer window.",
      "It's mind boggling to think that Amorim has not even been in charge at Old Trafford for a year. However, a combination of his insistence on playing a back three and goalkeeping issues, with both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, have seen United ship 44 goals during his time in charge.",
      "His fallings out with senior players, such as Marcus Rashford, who has since joined Barcelona on loan, and Alejandro Garnacho have raised eyebrows and seen his position come under scrutiny.",
      "A discernible lack of improvement on the pitch, with former United stars such a Wayne Rooney questioning Amorim's constant in-game tinkering, has the Portuguese boss staring down the barrel just over nine months into his spell.",
      "Amorim is yet to taste victory this season too, with an opening day 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal coupled with an underwhelming 1-1 draw away to Fulham. Next up for United is a home match against Premier League new-boys Burnley on Saturday ahead of the international break. A short trip to Manchester City awaits after that.",
      "Liverpool, on the other hand, are heading into an early season title clash with Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, with Slot's side having won two from two so far.",
      "Following their midweek humiliation to Grimsby, United will now be looking at the game against the Clarets as a must-win to keep their season afloat. A sliding doors moment indeed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Grimsby Town boss David Artell has heaped more embarrassment on Manchester United by insisting his side should not have needed penalties to win their Carabao Cup tie. Artell’s Mariners became the first fourth-tier side ever to beat United in a competitive match following a 2-2 draw at Blundell Park.",
      "The hosts deservedly led the tie at the break through goals from Charles Vernam and United youth product Tyrell Warren. Goalkeeper Andre Onana should have done better for the first goal and was embarrassed for the second before United fought back to level thanks to substitute Bryan Mbeumo’s strike and a late Harry Maguire header.",
      "Matheus Cunha wasted the chance to win the shootout after Onana had denied Clarke Oduor, with Mbeumo eventually sending his second effort off the crossbar in a 12-11 loss. At 1-0 and 2-0 up, Grimsby had goals disallowed, the first for handball and the second following a contentious offside call.",
      "“The disappointing thing, and I’m not trying to be… I don’t know what the word is, certainly not live on air! We should have won in 90 minutes, that’s the kicker for me. It shouldn’t have gone to the most ridiculous penalty shootout of my whole career. It shouldn’t have taken that to get over the line.”",
      "However, it didn’t take the gloss off one of the most significant results in the club’s history. Artell added: “It’s a magnificent night for the club and players. I hope it lives long in the memory.”",
      "Having gone so close to winning in normal time, Artell was asked what he said to his players before the shootout. He said: “I asked them, what is a penalty shootout? Just one question. A technical challenge, a psychological challenge, that’s it.",
      "“No tactics, no physical stuff. You’re going to feel nervous, you’re going to have butterflies, sweaty palms. That is absolutely normal, it’s a human thing, so don’t worry about that.",
      "“Then it’s a technical thing. Onana’s save from the one penalty we missed was an outstanding save. They backed themselves to be good technically, no pressure on them. There was no pressure on them before the game.",
      "“The only thing we could have lost was a bit of pride if we’d got whalloped by an unbelievably good team. Make no bones about it, they’ve got an unbelievably good team.”",
      "Grimsby’s reward is a third round trip to crisis club Sheffield Wednesday next month. For now, the Mariners’ focus returns to League Two and their home clash with Bristol Rovers on Saturday.",

      "Jadon Sancho has offered fans a glimpse into life as an exile at Manchester United as the end of the summer transfer window approaches. Sancho is still waiting for his future to be decided ahead of Monday’s deadline, having seen a succession of deals collapse.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has been in limbo this summer, having been placed in the ‘bomb squad’ by Ruben Amorim. The United manager told Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia that they had no future at the club before pre-season began.",
      "The group of outcasts have been forced to train by themselves, away from the first team group at Carrington, arriving after everyone else has left. And while Rashford has left for Barcelona, the rest of the outcasts remain at the club.",
      "Sancho has appeared close to leaving on a few occasions, with Fenerbahce, Juventus and Besiktas all showing an interest after Chelsea decided not to sign him permanently following his loan spell with them. Time is now running out, but Sancho doesn’t appear concerned about his future, judging by his social media output.",
      "On Wednesday he posted a selfie of himself, Malacia, Antony and Lisandro Martinez relaxing in the dressing room. Martinez is recovering from a long-term injury and appears to be one of the few United players who is allowed to interact with the bomb squad group.",
      "Interestingly, Garnacho is the only member of the group not pictured. The Argentina international is the subject of transfer interest from Chelsea, but, like the others, is yet to agree terms over an exit.",
      "Sancho has contributed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 matches for United since joining from Borussia Dortmund for £73million in 2021. He did better on loan with Chelsea, with five goals and 10 assists in 41 games last season, but their decision to pay £5m rather than sign him for £25m showed how far he has fallen.",
      "Sancho has turned down opportunities to join Fenerbahce and Besiktas because he does not want to move to Turkey at this stage of his career. He had come close to joining Juventus earlier in the summer, while there has been interest from Roma and Inter Milan, but nothing is close at this stage.",
      "Having spent over £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United need to offload some of their unwanted players before they can sign more stars in the transfer window. They want to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but face the prospect of missing out on him to Galatasaray because they don’t currently have the funds available.",
      "Amorim had also wanted to sign a No.6 midfielder in this transfer window, but that prospect has not emerged, in part due to the inability to shift the members of his bomb squad.",

      "Andre Onana's outing in Manchester United's dismal defeat against Grimsby will have done little to reassure Ruben Amorim over his first choice goalkeeper. While there is already plenty of scrutiny on the Portuguese coach's position, the name of who is guarding his net could yet change first.",
      "After an error-strewn and uncertain start to the season for Altay Bayindir against Arsenal and Fulham, Onana returned to United's line-up for the trip to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. The former Inter star's future had already been a subject of conversation this summer with transfer links to the likes of Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez in recent months.",
      "Onana failed to crown himself in glory as United went two-nil down at Blundell Park before forcing penalties. The 29-year-old would have been disappointed to be beaten at his near post by Charles Vernam's effort and was caught floundering from a corner as Tyrell Warren was allowed to double the scoreline.",
      "Ahead of the game, Amorim was asked what was required of Onana. Many would suggest he failed to meet his coach's demands.",
      "\"He needs to do his job; it’s the same thing,\" said Amorim. \"I just expect the best from him, from my players. It doesn’t matter the context, if it’s a cup game or whatever. We just need to improve some things that went wrong against Fulham. He needs to improve his position, like always, so he’s ready for the game, and I expect the best from him.\"",
      "Amorim did not point the finger of blame at his goalkeeper following the match however. Instead he was critical of the whole team.",
      "“With all respect when you play against a fourth division team, it's not the goalkeeper, it's everything,” Amorim said. “It's the environment. It's the way we face the competition. Everything. With that performance today my players spoke for me really loud.”",
      "United transfer target Senne Lammens was left out of Royal Antwerp's squad for their clash with Mechelen, amid a prospective move to the Red Devils. Lammens would provide competition for Onana.",

United have strengthened their squad this summer, forking out over £200million to bring in the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha.

      "The 21-year-old will become United's fourth-highest sale in history, following Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, and Angel Di Maria. Chelsea initially entered discussions by offering £25m for the youngster.",
      "Garnacho's sale will also represent the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "Club sources believe they have negotiated a pragmatic deal for a player who has been pushing strongly to leave, following a deterioration in his relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed and the winger questioned Amorim's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Garnacho on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid in September 2020 and after progressing in the academy and winning the FA Youth Cup, the youngster became an established part of the first-team squad.",
      "Garnacho was handed his senior debut by Ralf Rangnick in April 2022 against Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "He developed further with Erik ten Hag in charge during 2022/2023, contributing six goals and six assists in 37 appearances across all competitions.",

      "Ruben Amorim had just a few hours' sleep after Manchester United's shock defeat to Grimsby.",
      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup on penalties against Grimsby at Blundell Park on Wednesday night.",
      "The team arrived back at Carrington just after 1am, but Amorim was back to work just hours later.",
      "Amorim arrived at the training complex shortly after 7am on Thursday morning. The full squad reported for training for 11am and will now have two days to prepare to face Burnley in the Premier League.",
      "United's players were pictured with glum faces as they drove into Carrington this morning.",
      "The players who started against Grimsby will do recovery work today to prepare for Burnley, while those who started on the bench or were not included in the squad complete a training session.",
      "Luke Shaw and Leny Yoro were rested for the trip to Grimsby and are set to return on Saturday.",
      "When asked what went wrong after Grimsby, Amorim said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.",
      "\"Doesn't matter [that we lost on penalties]. In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.",
      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",
      "\"You cannot change so much. You cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance. I think this is a little bit the limit.",
      "\"I think something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.\"",
      "The international break will begin following United's game against Burnley at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Just three games into the season, the positivity has evaporated at Manchester United.",
      "United suffered a shock defeat to Grimsby Town on penalties in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday night, leading some fans to question Ruben Amorim's future at the club.",
      "After his appointment in November, Amorim oversaw a dismal 2024/2025 season. Shocking results were supposed to be behind Amorim, but United reached a new low against Grimsby.",
      "The inquest has begun and United will play Burnley in the Premier League this weekend before the international break begins. Amorim has just two days at Carrington to prepare for the game and we've taken a closer look at what United's head coach must do next to improve the situation.",
      "Andre Onana was at fault for Grimsby's second goal, failing to connect with the cross into the box and leaving an open net at the mercy of Tyrell Warren. It was an awful mistake from another corner, and it was the ninth Onana error that led to a goal since the start of last season.",
      "Altay Bayindir made a mistake of his own from a corner against Arsenal. The Turkish international swiped at the ball and was at fault for Riccardo Calafiori's winner on the opening day of the season.",
      "United have two bad goalkeepers contending for starts and Amorim picked the lesser of two evils against Grimsby, recalling Onana to the starting team after benching him against Fulham.",
      "Amorim has messed up the goalkeeping situation and wouldn't have helped Onana's confidence by preferring Bayindir to start the season. Having said that, Onana is responsible for his howler against Grimsby and it's obvious that United need to sign a new goalkeeper before the deadline.",
      "United are in talks to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. Whether Lammens is ready to start in the Premier League remains to be seen, but he will at least provide solid competition.",
      "Amorim needs a reliable goalkeeper and must be sick to his back teeth of amateur mistakes leading to goals.",
      "Did any player emerge with credit from a brutal first-half performance? Kobbie Mainoo made his first start of the season and was probably the pick of a bad bunch at Blundell Park.",
      "There have been reports about Mainoo's future over the last few days because his contract situation has stalled and there are doubts about where he fits into Amorim's plans.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute against Fulham and Arsenal. He misplaced a few passes against Grimsby, but most of his play was slick and Amorim must start the youngster in the midfield pivot to go forward.",
      "Ugarte and Casemiro currently have no business starting for United. Amorim needs to give Mainoo a run of games alongside Fernandes because they will help United to gain control of games.",
      "The centre of the pitch is a problem and Amorim cannot overlook a supremely talented midfielder for much longer.",
      "United could react to their disappointing start to the season by splashing the cash on a late midfield signing before the transfer deadline. They did the same in 2022 following bad defeats to Brighton and Brentford.",
      "It would be logical to sign a defensive midfielder, someone with a similar profile to Ugarte and Casemiro. A potential new arrival could start alongside Mainoo and Fernandes could rotate in the No.10 roles.",
      "That would mean either Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, or Matheus Cunha would miss out. Fernandes is considered a guaranteed starter and United have spent £127.5m on Mbeumo and Cunha this summer.",
      "Amorim needs results and must go into the international break with a win against Burnley this weekend. Amorim would take any form of victory at Old Trafford, but a convincing display would help ease concerns.",
      "If United scrape past Burnley, the conversation about his future will continue quietly throughout the break.",
      "However, if United fail to claim three points, Amorim's future will dominate headlines.",
      "After the break, United take on Manchester City in the Manchester derby and the worst will be feared at the Etihad if United go into the clash without a Premier League win to their name.",

      "Manchester United have been down this road before.",
      "After amassing one point from their opening two Premier League games, Ruben Amorim and his players must have travelled to Blundell Park to face Grimsby Town on Wednesday night confident of securing their first win of the new season against League Two opposition.",
      "But just as Louis van Gaal did back in 2014, Amorim fell foul to a League Cup giant-killing. The scoreline on the Lincolnshire coast was not quite as harrowing as the 4-0 drubbing United experienced in their last second round appearance in the competition at the hands of MK Dons 11 years ago, but the inquest will require greater scrutiny.",
      "Despite making eight changes to his starting line-up from the weekend's 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage, Amorim still named an XI littered with international caps and talent.",
      "United's front-three cost £147.9million before taking add-ons into account. By comparison, Grimsby's average weekly wage is reportedly just £1,809.",
      "There can be no excuses for Amorim or his players after Wednesday night's horror show. The Reds were incredibly fortunate to take the tie to a penalty shootout after finding themselves 2-0 down at half-time, and Amorim admitted afterwards it would have been \"so unfair\" on Grimsby had his team scraped through.",
      "For the first 75 minutes, United's performance was worse than the one that was served up by Van Gaal's Reds at Stadium MK 11 years ago. Facing League One opposition that night, the Dutchman named a mixture of youth and experience in his starting XI.",
      "The one Amorim named at Blundell Park, with the exception of Tyler Fredricson at right-sided centre-back, was made up of first-team regulars.",
      "United had a Champions League finalist between the posts, European Championship finalists in defence and midfield, and a striker at the top end of the pitch who could end up costing them north of £70m.",
      "There was simply no excuse for the limp performance United served up. They were appalling.",
      "After being appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, no right-minded United supporter thought Amorim was going to be able to wave a magic wand and instantly turn things around. He inherited a messy situation and he was going to require time.",
      "Less than a year into his tenure, it is fair to suggest he still needs time, but how much time can he be afforded? His trademark 3-4-2-1 system isn't working and United, either side of the summer break, have now won just four of their last 17 matches.",
      "As much as it is seemingly trendy nowadays for some managers to prioritise style over results, football is all about winning. Right now, United are not winning anywhere near enough football matches.",
      "Just like in 2014, United have failed to win their opening two league games, earning one point, and have crashed out of the League Cup at the second round stage to a side two or more divisions beneath them in the pyramid. Funnily enough, this weekend's opponent, Burnley, were next on the agenda after that infamous MK Dons defeat.",
      "United travelled to Turf Moor to bring August to a close 11 years ago and drew 0-0. Failure to win at Old Trafford this weekend will only add to the pressure on Amorim's shoulders.",
      "The transfer window will slam shut a little over 48 hours after Saturday's clash with the Clarets ends and United will be planning to make more additions before the 7pm cut-off.",
      "Andre Onana's calamitous performance only reinforced United's need for a new goalkeeper. Their need for a midfielder is also well-documented.",
      "However, as vital as it is to address those two weaknesses, United need to make serious improvements under Amorim. Supporters are becoming increasingly restless and Amorim's refusal to alter his ways is not helping matters.",
      "Van Gaal led United to a top-four finish in 2014/15, but the competition was weaker then than it is now. Right now, United don't even look as though they are capable of mounting a top half finish for the second season running.",

      "This signing is expected to add further uncertainty to the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır. Ruben Amorim once again opted for Bayındır as his starting goalkeeper in the 1-1 draw against Fulham over the weekend.",

      "Meanwhile, Reds captain Bruno Fernandes remains a target for clubs in Saudi Arabia, while the futures of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Rasmus Højlund are still uncertain.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Jose Mourinho reportedly could inadvertently help facilitate former club Manchester United moving on from Andre Onana before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "Turkish online sports newspaper Fanatik claims Inter are making a move to re-sign Onana. He spent the 2022/23 season in Milan before leaving for Manchester barely a year after signing.",
      "Yann Sommer replaced the Cameroon international and remains their number one to start this term. Inter would reportedly move on from the 36-year-old should Onana return.",
      "Mourinho-coached Fenerbahce are said to be one club following the situation regarding Sommer. They reportedly want to sign a new goalkeeper.",
      "Having agreed a fee deemed suitable by Manchester United, further details on Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea have been revealed.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, he will be in London to undergo a medical on Friday and sign his seven-year contract.",
      "Once the deal goes through, he will become the club's fourth most expensive sale after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he expects Carlos Baleba to remain at the club.",
      "Manchester United made contact over the possibility of a summer transfer but were met by a resounding response from the Seagulls with a huge asking price also quoted. With a switch already appearing unlikely, Hurzeler has dashed all remaining hopes.",
      "Asked whether he was 100 per cent confident that Baleba would be staying put at Brighton this summer, head coach Hurzeler said in his press conference ahead of his side's clash with Manchester City: \"Yes.",
      "\"If there's a number more than 100, I would even say more than 100 so I'm confident.\"",
      "Chelsea have reached an agreement with Manchester United for the transfer of Alejandro Garnacho, it is being widely reported.",
      "Earlier this year, the Argentine winger was told by Ruben Amorim he could leave Old Trafford with a move to Stamford Bridge as his priority.",
      "Attempts to sign him were made in the January transfer window but those were rebuffed. However, Garnacho has been set on joining Chelsea with his wish now being granted.",
      "He will sign a seven-year contract with the Blues and will cost £40million as a fixed fee. United have also included a 10 per cent sell-on clause in the deal.",
      "Manchester United transfer target Senne Lammens has held talks with a different club, it has been claimed.",
      "The Royal Antwerp goalkeeper is wanted by those at Old Trafford but they now look set to face competition for his signature.",
      "According to the Telegraph, talks with Galatasaray have taken place today with this deal far from straightforward for United.",
      "Shedding light on the latter, it has been noted that negotiations over personal terms have been challenging.",
      "Andre Onana's imminent future does not look set to impact a move for Senne Lammens with talks for him to join from Royal Antwerp resuming on Thursday.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, United want a new goalkeeper regardless of what happens with Onana.",
      "He has also claimed that negotiations are taking place between United and Antwerp to try and reach an agreement with the former willing to offer over £17.3million (€20m) inclusive of add-ons.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Antony appear on the verge of departing Manchester United to join Chelsea and Real Betis, respectively.",
      "The latter spent last season on loan in Spain and is in talks to return with transfer guru Fabrizio Romano noting that negotiations between the two parties are entering a crucial stage.",
      "Garnacho sealing a move to Stamford Bridge, has been described as a \"given at this point\" by journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "An update on Kobbie Mainoo's Manchester United future has been issued by journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "If Mainoo gets a concrete option and they bid about £33million, and Mainoo says to Manchester United in the next 48 hours or so, 'I want to go before September 1st,’ then my expectation is that Manchester United won't stand in his way.",
      "The 20-year-old played the entirety of United's Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and has attracted interest from Spain.",
      "Away from transfer news, the other major story surrounds the future of Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town.",

      "In terms of potential new signings, Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens looks to be edging closer to joining. A new midfielder could also join especially if Kobbie Mainoo leaves.",
      "Stay right here to follow all the latest United transfer news and rumours...",
      "Alan Shearer says Man United are ‘a million miles’ from where they need to be, yet the club has committed to backing Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese manager’s rocky 10-month tenure at Old Trafford hit a new low on Wednesday as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by League Two side Grimsby Town. Shearer said: \"As soon as they went all in for Amorim and they got him straight away, rather than waiting until the end of the season, they were always going to have to back him. They have backed him and it's now up to him to get them back into some sort of respectable position.",
      "\"They've spent an absolute fortune already this summer but they still need to spend. Whether they can get in what they want in this window or whether they're going to have to wait, we'll have to wait and see but I think it's going to be really tough. You look at what the top four or five have spent and then there's the chasing pack, maybe Man United might and I say might, be one of them but even still, they will find it tough to get anywhere near the top five this season. They're a million miles away from where they were or where they want to be.\"",
      "Following Wednesday night's shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town, pressure is naturally increasing on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Yes, it's only August. Yes, the season is only three games old. Yes, United still have work to do in the transfer market. However, all of the positivity generated throughout pre-season is already a distant memory.",
      "It feels unlikely that United will pull the plug on Amorim just yet, particularly if co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on the former Sporting Lisbon boss are anything to go by.",
      "Ratcliffe told the BBC back in March: \"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. I think he is an excellent manager and I think he'll be there for a long time.\"",
      "\"I think if you look at the squad he has got at his disposal, with the injury list he has got at his disposal, and he comes in mid-season where he has had no time to train the players in his style of play, I think he has done really well,\" Ratcliffe continued, speaking in the same interview he conducted earlier this year. I think you are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of that against Arsenal yesterday.\"",

      "Former Man United chief scout Mick Brown says Hojlund wants to return to Italy.",
      "\"Rasmus Hojlund wants to go back to Italy,\" he told Football Insider. \"There’s been interest from a few Premier League teams, but it’s the likes of Milan and Napoli which are more likely to get a deal done.",
      "\"They know what he can do over there, and he knows what he can do in that division. It’ll be familiar to him, it’s a bit of a step down from the Premier League and Man United.",
      "\"There’s not as much pressure on him to perform as there is here. So if he can go over there, start playing more regular football and find his feet, it’s ultimately a move that would work best for everybody. Because he doesn’t have a future at Man United or under Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "The press conference room is a small portable cabin at Blundell Park. There was not enough room for Manchester United correspondents, so Ruben Amorim's post-match press conference was pitchside.",
      "Amorim said he was \"really sorry\" to supporters and appeared to question whether the players were onside with him. \"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want,\" he said.",
      "United's head coach was not happy from the first whistle. Amorim frantically waved his arms, stamped his feet on the touchline and then dished out a b********* during the interval.",

      "Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man United are 'seriously considering' signing Stuttgart star Stiller.",
      "The VfB Stuttgart midfielder has emerged as an alternative to strengthen Ruben Amorim's midfield that has looked vulnerable at the start of the season. However, it's said he's not viewed as a direct replacement for the primary target, Carlos Baleba.",
      "Stiller reportedly has a £32 million release clause.",
      "Caught Offisde claim that multiple sources have told them United are close to announcing a deal for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens for a fee of around €20m (£17m).",
      "\"A full agreement is now within reach,\" one source told Caught Offside. This is said to have been confirmed by another, who added: \"United are on the brink of securing this deal. Negotiations have entered the final stretch.\"",
      "Tottenham are reportedly considering Jadon Sancho as a potential replacement for their departed captain, Son Heung-Min.",

      "Reports from Turkey suggest that Galatasaray have swooped in ahead of United in their bid to sign the 23-year-old Belgian.",
      "United are said to need to move players on before finalising the deal, but Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony all remain at the club for the time being.",
      "Elche are pushing to sign Malacia on loan and have already started working on a deal, claims Spanish journalist Matteo Moretto.",
      "Although it's said they have started working on a deal, they are reportedly not alone in the race, with Lille among the clubs considering a move for the Dutch full-back.",
      "Manchester United suffered a major setback after they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "The home side opened the scoring when Charles Vernam's shot beat Andre Onana at the near post. Then, just eight minutes later, the United goalkeeper was at fault again, failing to deal with a cross that allowed Tyrell Warren to bundle the ball into an empty net.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo netted his first goal for the club with 15 minutes remaining, before Harry Maguire equalised for United with a header in the 89th minute. In the penalty shootout, misses from Clarke Oduor and Matheus Cunha took the contest to sudden death. Ultimately, it was Mbeumo who missed the decisive spot-kick, handing Grimsby a dramatic 12-11 victory. And below is a look at what the national media had to say on events at Blundell Park.",

      "According to Goal Brazil, Cristiano Ronaldo's team recently reached out to the midfield maestro about a high-value move to reunite with his former teammate.",
      "However, it's said that Casemiro has made it clear that he intends to stay at Old Trafford this year, focusing on securing a spot in Brazil’s squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The report adds: \"Casemiro has not ruled out a move to Saudi Arabia after the 2026 World Cup. The Brazilian is considering a transfer after fulfilling his desire to play in the last World Cup for the Brazilian national team.\"",
      "Brighton & Hove Albion have reportedly engaged in discussions with representatives of Man United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo about a potential deal before the transfer window closes.",
      "According to FootballTransfers, Brighton are showing strong interest, seriously considering a move for the midfielder before the transfer deadline. The report suggests the player is reportedly open to a permanent move to the Seagulls.",
      "With that said, United could reportedly leverage Brighton's interest in Mainoo to strengthen their chances of securing Carlos Baleba in next summer's transfer window.",
      "Man United and Chelsea are nearing an agreement over a deal for Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "According to The Telegraph, he has been valued between £35 and £40 million. The 21-year-old is not part of Ruben Amorim’s plans, but there’s a clear recognition that Chelsea would be securing a young talent with Premier League experience.",
      "The price tag reflects that, with United initially basing his valuation on the £50 million Arsenal paid Chelsea for England international Noni Madueke.",
      "Man United have reportedly rejected the offer to sign Adrien Rabiot.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube video, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Zero movements at the moment on this one. Manchester United are focused on different things.",
      "\"Keep an eye on Adrien Rabiot. Marseille want around €15m-20m to let him leave. Many of those close to Rabiot’s camp are proposing the opportunity to offer him to clubs, for example, to Manchester United.",

      "Following Wednesday night's shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town, pressure is naturally increasing on Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Yes, it's only August. Yes, the season is only three games old. Yes, United still have work to do in the transfer market. However, all of the positivity generated throughout pre-season is already a distant memory.",
      "With the first international break of the season almost upon us, there is already pressure on Amorim and United to deliver a result against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The Clarets are among the favourites for relegation from the Premier League this season and anything less than three points for United will be frowned upon, resulting in the pressure on Amorim's shoulders increasing further.",
      "United, of course, have been through their fair share of managers and coaches since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, meaning many believe the club should stand by Amorim in the hope of him turning the club's fortunes around. Almost every United supporter acknowledged he needed a full pre-season and full summer transfer window before making a firm judgement on him.",
      "However, following the manner of Wednesday night's defeat on the Lincolnshire coast, questions are being asked of the Portuguese chief just three games into the season.",
      "It feels unlikely that United will pull the plug on Amorim just yet, particularly if co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on the former Sporting Lisbon boss are anything to go by.",
      "Ratcliffe told the BBC back in March: \"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do.",
      "\"I think he is an excellent manager and I think he'll be there for a long time.\"",
      "United, following several comings and goings in recent years, desperately need a sense of continuity. Amorim ranked as one of Europe's most promising coaches last year and was United's top target to replace Erik ten Hag last November, meaning he carries the belief of the club's hierarchy in him.",
      "\"I think if you look at the squad he has got at his disposal, with the injury list he has got at his disposal, and he comes in mid-season where he has had no time to train the players in his style of play, I think he has done really well,\" Ratcliffe continued, speaking in the same interview he conducted earlier this year.",
      "\"I think you are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of that against Arsenal yesterday.\"",
      "To Amorim's credit, United have offered glimpses of what they can do under him. However, they have now won just four of their last 17 games either side of the summer break - and that record is becoming increasingly difficult for Amorim to defend.",

      "Ruben Amorim showed full emotion and delivered an honest statement following the defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.",
      "Their humiliating League Cup exit at the hands of a League Two side leaves theFA Cup as their only realistic chance of silverware this season. United fell 2-0 behind to Grimsby at half-time at Blundell Park, rallied with two late goals to take the game to penalties, but ultimately lost 12-11 in a marathon shootout.",
      "Amorim said the players 'spoke really loud today about what they want,' implying they weren’t up for the challenge against the fourth-tier side",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at everything the Reds head coach said after the defeat to Grimsby.",
      "How do you sum up your emotion: \"In the end, for me, was worse than the beginning. It's not about the result, or in the penalties, I was not thinking about the penalties to go to the next stage, I was just... I think the way we play, the way we face competition in one moment everything is so important, I think the players spoke really loud about what they want today.",
      "\"Guys, it's really clear. I just want to apologise to our fans and we will have a game now, and we have time to think. Everything [was missing]. We need to be proud to go to the pitch and we know, that every draw in the Premier League it's going to be a huge problem. We came from one draw, we played quite well, both games in the Premier League.",
      "\"We know that people will get everything in our club and we come to the game with a fourth division team and we perform like that, I think again, the players clearly show what they want. It's hard to speak, I'm seven months talking about the environment or whatever.\"",
      "Are you shocked by what you've seen tonight? \"And you are not? I'm shocked. I'm shocked because we are in the moment we make a lot of changes and we try to fight a lot of things, then we need to show up because if we don't, you can feel it that something has to change and you are not going to change 22 players again.\"",
      "What about Andre Onana? \"It's not about the goalkeeper. With all due respect, against the fourth division we have to block everything with the opponent. Andre should touch the ball with his feet if we are in the high level. So again, I don't know what to say anymore to our fans. It's hard to face everything and that's it.\"",
      "Changing the formation: \"It's not about changing the formation. We play against Arsenal, we play really well. We play against Liverpool, we play really well, we got to the Europa League final in the disaster season with the same system. The system is not important, we can play with four, five defenders, that doesn't matter. What matters is that we need to be different and that is the job of the coach and you can see that nothing changed.\"",
      "Didn't watch the penalty shootout: \"The penalty shootout is not important, if I'm there trying to see if we win the game. The signs, the beginning of the game, during the game, that's what matters. If we win this game, it would have been so unfair for these guys, the opponent, so unfair. So today, the football was really fair so congratulations to them and we move to the next game and then we have time to decide things.\"",
      "Message to fans: \"I just want to say sorry to our fans. I have nothing to say anymore about the performance when everything is so important in our club and you try to do everything, from pre-season, the Arsenal game - you lose it but you are improving, but then reach this kind of game, when everything is so important to our club and we start the game like this, I think my players are talking really loudly about what they want so I'm really sorry to our fans, I have nothing to say anymore.\"",

Castore, which boasts sporting sponsorship deals with England Rugby, England Cricket and Andy Murray, now adds Belstaff to its portfolio.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Having witnessed their journey, we saw a unique opportunity to join forces and accelerate Belstaff's transformation through shared knowledge and resources.\" Castore co-founder and chief executive Tom Beahon of Castore expressed his satisfaction at the investment.",
      "\"We are delighted that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos is investing in Castore,\" he said, \"which is a demonstration of commitment to our business and global growth ambitions, and we look forward to working together to deliver on this vision.\" Ratcliffe's recent forays into sport have not yielded many desired outcomes, with the Formula 1 and grand tour cycling teams struggling.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, lost a penalty shootout to League Two team Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup this week. That has led to fresh questions about the current situation at Old Trafford, with fans pointing fingers at Ratcliffe – who owns just under 30 per cent of United – and the majority shareholding Glazer family.",
      "Last year's results saw leather jacket manufacturer Belstaff report a loss of £18m, and its acquisition by Castore signifies a move from its usual sportswear and athleisure portfolio into more luxury fashion. Lawrence of Arabia famously wore a Belstaff jacket, and Steve McQueen sported one in The Great Escape.",

      "United exited the Carabao Cup at the second round stage in shock circumstances on Wednesday night, being dumped out of the competition by League Two side Grimsby Town at Blundell Park.",
      "After fighting back from 2-0 down to restore parity and bring the 90 minutes to a close with the scores level at 2-2, United were beaten 12-11 on penalties, meaning Amorim was left to try and explain exactly what went wrong.",
      "Asked what went wrong, he said: \"Everything. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened, it's a problem in our club, we should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans.",
      "\"I felt my players spoke really loud today what they want. I think it's easy for you [how to interpret it]. Let's focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.\"",
      "Having failed to win any of their opening three matches this term, United and Amorim will be under huge pressure to deliver a positive result against Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Following a first pre-season at the helm and a first opportunity to put a meaningful stamp on the squad he inherited from former United boss Erik ten Hag, United supporters, ahead of the season opener against Arsenal earlier this month, were hopeful Amorim would start his first full season in charge with a bang.",
      "Although it is still very early days, a small majority of United fans are already fearful he might not be in charge come the end of the campaign. MEN Sport conducted an online survey that attracted 6,000 responses and 57 per cent of voters do not believe Amorim will last the season.",
      "Despite leading the club to last season's Europa League final, his overall record as United head coach, although you must account for a cluster of caveats, has not been good enough. He has won just 16 of his 45 games in charge, recording just eight domestic victories.",
      "Additionally, 56 per cent of those who participated in the survey are less confident about the rest of United's season following their sluggish start. A lesser 28 per cent still believe the season will go as they originally expected it to.",

      "United's head coach was not happy from the first whistle. Amorim frantically waved his arms, stamped his feet on the touchline and then dished out a b********* during the interval.",
      "Once Amorim had spoken to the broadcast rights holder and the traditional press, he made a beeline for the tunnel, but three young Grimsby fans asked him for a photograph.",
      "Amorim was seething about the result and would have been forgiven for ignoring the supporters. Most managers wouldn't have acknowledged their request, but he took five seconds to take a photograph.",
      "You can only tip your hat to Amorim for demonstrating politeness in such a difficult moment.",
      "It wouldn't have been rude for Amorim to blank the young fans, but he seemed to feel so. Amorim's admirable human principles are regularly on show and his character is partly why lots are still rooting for him.",
      "Amorim spends time after games at Old Trafford signing autographs and taking photos with fans, regardless of the result, which has won him admiration and respect from the fanbase.",
      "The 40-year-old has also made a strong impression on the journalists who report on the club. Amorim speaks warmly, his honesty is refreshing and he can be charming during press conferences.",
      "Amorim has improved morale in the dressing room. The bad eggs were banished and sources admitted Amorim created a feeling of 'us against them' after banishing some big names.",
      "He only wanted to sign players with the right personalities this summer. Amorim is likeable and wants to sign players with similar values. He is clearly a good person, but that hasn't stopped supporters from beginning to question him just three games into the new campaign.",
      "There were positives to take from the Arsenal defeat, but the performance at Craven Cottage felt like a continuation of last season, which was the warning sign for the Grimsby debacle.",
      "United started the game with £401million worth of talent on the pitch and were second best in most departments. Grimsby pounced on every second ball and the red shirts could not match their intensity.",
      "The system has been a huge sticking point throughout Amorim's time in Manchester and a section of old-school fans simply do not agree that United should ever play with five at the back.",
      "Amorim is desperately trying to make it work, but shocking defeats do not help his cause and the doubters are growing louder. United will not make a knee-jerk reaction on his future, but there will be an acceptance within the board that results need to improve quickly in the coming weeks.",
      "There are no more excuses for Amorim. He has spent close to £200million to overhaul his attacking line and United still did not look like scoring for large parts of the game against Grimsby.",
      "The cheque book might make a final appearance this summer to sign a midfielder before the deadline. Remember United reacting to humiliating defeats against Brighton and Brentford by signing Casemiro in 2022?",

Onana replaced Altay Bayindir on Wednesday night, but hindered rather than helped his chances of starting against Burnley at Old Trafford this weekend.",

      "Speaking in an interview with BetMGM, Butt shared his thoughts on the managerial situation.",
      "He said: “We can’t accept it getting worse than last year. If it does and how much time Ruben Amorim gets, well, we know what it’s like. November or December, if United are 15th and not playing well, then the rumour mill starts. He’ll be under pressure, even more than he is now.",
      "“I think you need to give him two transfer windows after this one, but then real progression is going to be needed from him too. I say ‘him’ because he is the leader, but everything has to improve and move forward. If it's standing still or going backwards, then he is in trouble.",
      "“The top teams will be getting better. Liverpool have already spent £200 million, plus maybe another £150m more on Alexander Isak – they aren't standing still.",

      "“It’s difficult bringing players into that system. Everyone talks about us [the class of 92] coming through, but if we’d have come through in this United side, we wouldn’t have stood a chance. People would have been saying, ‘where’s Nicky Butt now, where’s David Beckham?’.",
      "“We were good young players, but we had the players in the squad like Paul Ince, Roy Keane, Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Bryan Robson and Eric Cantona – we had so many top-class players around us, you could afford to have an off day.",
      "“Now, though, players are written off as not good enough straight away; it’s clear that the experience and the leaders just aren’t there and they have to come into the squad soon.”",

      "\"I think the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. The best players lose because one team can win, against any group of players.",
      "\"I think the team and players spoke really loud. So that's it.\"",
      "The biggest worry for Ruben Amorim? This is now his Manchester United team.",
      "It was chaotic, gripping, dramatic, emotional and, ultimately, for United, this was catastrophic. Things have not yet fallen into place for Amorim at the United helm, but this was an undoubted and humiliating nadir.",
      "Last season, the Portuguese could hide behind a number of excuses for underwhelming performances. He was, for the most part, putting square pegs in round holes to blood his tried-and-tested wing-back formation, using players signed by Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho.",
      "But on Wednesday night - at humble Blundell Park in Cleethorpes - the former Sporting CP head coach unleashed his starting XI and that £400million-plus ensemble were shown up good and proper.",
      "And by little old Grimsby Town, live on national TV!",
      "Naturally, the aftermath of this most harrowing of \"cup-sets\" is going to focus on United's clear shortcomings, the future of Amorim and the countless millions that have been spent on players that are not up to standard. But that should be the backdrop to the most magical and unthinkable David (literally) vs Goliath success.",
      "As any Grimsby supporter will tell you right now, last night was all a bit surreal, throwing up a blend of emotions, none of which feel real at this moment. When Charles Vernam's opener hit the net, disbelief. When former United youngster Tyrell Warren bundled home a second, ecstasy.",
      "After goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire... the chance had surely gone? Penalties? Heart and head both pounding, the voice long gone from shouting and singing. When Mbeumo crashed against the crossbar? Yet more disbelief, elation and every emotion you could think of. Above all, pride.",
      "And yet post-match, with my work hat back on, the focus was United. It even was for one Grimsby hero!",
      "\"It's not sunk in yet. I'm a Man Utd fan, so I'm half-fuming a little bit.\"",
      "The brilliant pitch-side reaction from Grimsby goalkeeper - and United fan - Christy Pym said it all.",
      "It was Pym who stood toe-to-toe (or glove-to-glove) with under-pressure Andre Onana for the most enthralling, drawn-out and emotional penalty shootout. The goalkeeping problem is a huge one for Amorim and United right now - with suggestions on social media that Pym should be signed by Ineos before September 1 providing a nice, light-hearted undertone.",
      "But the club Pym supports are beyond half-fuming.",
      "Onana, a mis-firing £200million strike-force and the lack of a proper defensive midfielder are just three - of many - on-field issues for Amorim to solve. That's nothing new, but the most alarming thing on Wednesday night was just how \"easily\" he was bested by his opposite number in the dugout.",
      "David Artell, a former Football League and Gibraltar international defender, is a hugely respected lower-division manager in his own right, having inspired Crewe Alexandra to League Two promotion in the Covid-hit 2019/2020 season and worked wonders with this plucky, expansive, brave and organised Grimsby side.",
      "By contrast, Amorim was seen frantically updating his tactics board in-game, but his pre-match plan and - maybe to a lesser extent - his tweaks throughout the 90 minutes were overshadowed by a Premier League-performance by Grimsby's Artell.",
      "Even his demeanour on the touchline - from kicking and heading every ball from his technical area to his relaxed and measured approach to the pressure cooker of a penalty shootout - saw him outclass Amorim in arguably the biggest game of his managerial career.",
      "Artell, articulate as he is passionate, spoke glowingly of Amorim in his own memorable post-match interview; the words that he had for the Portuguese - and United - were genuine, respectful and classy. United supporters were (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) clamouring for Pym between the posts instead of Onana - they might have been wiser to call for Artell instead!",

    "body": [
      "Rio Ferdinand argued that Kobbie Mainoo needs to do more behind the scenes to guarantee a start at Manchester United while shutting down Paul Scholes' \"wild\" comparison to Zinedine Zidane.",
      "Mainoo was included in the starting XI for the first time this season on Wednesday night in United's Carabao Cup second round defeat at League Two Grimsby Town. The fourth-tier side were 2-0 up before the break, and it took a late Harry Maguire leveller to take the game to penalties.",
      "Grimsby completed the upset when Bryan Mbeumo saw his second penalty hit the bar, and the Red Devils crashed out 12-11 on spot kicks. Mainoo played the entire 90 minutes and assisted Mbeumo for United's first goal of the night - but the loss may not have convinced Ruben Amorim to keep the 20-year-old in his future plans.",
      "During a recording of Ferdinand's podcast earlier this week, co-host Joel Beya brought up the words of fellow United icon Scholes, who stated Mainoo was far superior to himself at such a young age, as he questioned why the England international couldn't get a start in Amorim's team.",
      "Beya said: \"Kobbie Mainoo has been a ghost man throughout this period. We've got the likes of Paul Scholes saying, 'He's the nearest thing I've seen to Zidane in taking the ball, receiving the ball, cruising past people. I've read a few comparisons between me and him and this kid. Don't waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.'",
      "\"If I'm Kobbie Mainoo bro, and you're not playing me and obviously the fans are still cheering for Amorim to stay, I could be looking for another club at the end of the season?\"",
      "However, Ferdinand wasn't entirely convinced as he stated his ex-team-mates' words \"were a bit wild\" in comparing Mainoo to the French footballing icon. Beya added that Ferdinand had compared the young midfielder to Clarence Seedorf, to which the ex-England captain said: \"I think he's more of a Seedorf player, that's what I think. I think his style of football is more Seedorf.\"",
      "Explaining his feelings on the Scholes-Zidane-Mainoo debate, Ferdinand said: \"But Scholes saying he is 10 times the player he was, and I think you've got to remember that telling number there at 19. At 19.",
      "\"That's what he's saying, Scholesy wasn't developed yet, still had fantastic potential, but Scholes had asthma, he couldn't finish games properly at a young age and stuff. He wasn't nowhere near the player he became at 19.",
      "\"At 19, this kid is playing in European championships, do you know what I mean? It's not like he's a kid who was there and you're going, 'Oh, he's just in the youth team, just got out of the youth team or the under-21s.'",
      "\"He was playing for England, starting for England. Scholesy at 19 wasn't doing that. So that's where he's talking about the comparison. But listen, I'm a massive fan of Kobbie.\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to detail just how Mainoo should be pushing for a start in Amorim's side, adding that he hopes the chance doesn't come if the young star isn't prepared. He said: \"But he has to work out, 'What do I need to do to get back in his team?'",
      "\"And we've all had these moments in our careers where you're like, 'S*** man, I'm not playing. What do I do?' Well, the first thing you do is go to the manager and go, 'What am I not doing that I need to be doing to get in this team?' Right. He's going to tell me. Then I go to work on a training pitch.",
      "\"Every day I go to work. I play up against whoever, Bruno [Fernandes] etc, and I start dominating them. Just that's the type of mentality and mindset he has to go with. And then when the chance comes to play, take it with both hands.",
      "\"Now his argument right now will be I'm not getting the chance to take it. And that's a fair argument. But what I would say is do not let the chance come and you're not ready. So train hard, be focused.\"",
      "Mainoo looked to have received his chance on Wednesday night in the Carabao Cup, and many may argue that he made up for going two behind by assisting one goal and scoring his penalty. However, Beya believes that the midfielder is unlikely to get many more decisions fall his way under Amorim, due to the Portuguese manager's strict system that he \"refuses to change.\"",
      "He added: \"I agree Rio, but I also think he is going to be someone suffering because of this system that Amorim plays and he refuses to change it. You know like it's you've got the talent there man no one can tell me that Kobbie Mainoo cannot play football, no one can tell me that boy isn't brilliant.",
      "\"One of the best talents I've ever seen, and you're telling me for whatever reason he couldn't get minutes yesterday [against Fulham]? He couldn't even come off [the bench]?\"",
      "The Athletic reports that United are happy with Mainoo at the club and aren't looking to get him out of the door before the deadline on September 1. However, there have been reports that the 20-year-old's valuation has dropped from £70million to £45m in recent weeks, and could drop even further before the window slams shut.",
      "If Beya's claims are thought to be correct and Mainoo sees no way back into Amorim's starting squad, then the England international may well consider a move away from Old Trafford for more regular football.",

      "Glory in football can often pivot on a crucial decision, and it seems Liverpool's choice to appoint Arne Slot over Ruben Amorim was one such defining moment.",
      "The contrasting fortunes of the two managers since their arrival in the Premier League couldn't be more stark. Following the unexpected announcement that Jurgen Klopp would depart Liverpool in January 2024, speculation was rife about his successor.",
      "It was no secret that Liverpool's top brass were keen on Sporting CP head coach Amorim to take up the mantle at Anfield. However, they chose Feyenoord boss Slot, while Manchester United eventually secured Amorim in November 2024 after dismissing Erik ten Hag.",
      "There were several factors behind Liverpool's preference for the Dutchman over his Portuguese rival, with concerns about Amorim's inflexible playing style being a significant issue for Anfield officials.",
      "ESPN reported that Amorim was overlooked not only due to his tactical rigidity but also because of the nearly £10million buy-out clause that Liverpool would have had to meet to bring Amorim to Merseyside.",
      "The Athletic suggested that premature reports of Liverpool's interest in Amorim also caused irritation within the Anfield club. Ultimately, Liverpool's management decided against Amorim as they believed his preferred 3-4-3 system wouldn't suit the squad left by Klopp, who frequently used a flat back four in a 4-3-3 formation.",
      "Amorim's tactical approach – which can morph into a 4-2-4 during transitions, a 5-2-3 when on the defensive, and a 3-2-5 when on the attack – was central to his managerial philosophy, reports the Mirror. However, Liverpool felt they lacked the squad depth to implement a three-man defence, while Slot was already committed to a four-man backline due to his successful 4-2-4 strategy in the Eredivisie.",
      "Recruiting Amorim would have been an expensive venture for Liverpool, necessitating a complete revamp of their established formation to accommodate Amorim's vision. The Athletic also reported that Liverpool had reservations about whether the 40-year-old's style of play would resonate with the Anfield faithful.",
      "Slot, on the other hand, has stated that he was ultimately the only candidate offered the Liverpool job. This indicates that he was the preferred choice in the end, despite rumours linking former Liverpool star Xabi Alonso, who eventually left Bayer Leverkusen for Real Madrid this summer.",
      "Despite Liverpool's apprehensions, United proceeded to hire Amorim, fully aware of the coach's preference for a three-man defence. Fast forward to the 2025/2026 season, Slot is rapidly becoming a legendary figure at Anfield and Liverpool are the reigning Premier League champions.",
      "In contrast, United are grappling with another crisis after the Red Devils were unceremoniously knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "Amorim's reputation, once soaring on the back of two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting in 2022 and 2024, seems to have hit rock bottom after guiding United to a disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League last season and suffering defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in May.",
      "With only 16 victories from 45 matches at United, his win rate stands at a meagre 35.6%. In contrast, his success rate at Sporting was an impressive 71%, while Ten Hag – the man he replaced at United – had a win rate of 56% at the time of his departure.",
      "It's not as if Amorim hasn't had the financial backing to mould United into his vision. Patrick Dorgu was signed for £29m in January, while this summer saw the arrival of Matheus Cunha in a deal worth £62.5m.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was recently snapped up for a hefty £71m. Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko is the latest addition, setting United back by £74m, while Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven were brought in at the start of the year for a combined total of around £5m – and it's thought that they're not finished in this current transfer window.",
      "It's staggering to think that Amorim has been at the helm at Old Trafford for less than a year. However, his stubborn insistence on a three-man defence and goalkeeping issues, involving both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, have contributed to United conceding 44 goals during his tenure.",
      "His disagreements with senior players, such as Marcus Rashford, who has since moved to Barcelona on loan, and Alejandro Garnacho have raised eyebrows and put his position under the microscope.",
      "The noticeable lack of progress on the pitch, with ex-United stars such as Wayne Rooney questioning Amorim's frequent in-game adjustments, has left the Portuguese boss in a precarious position just over nine months into his tenure.",
      "Amorim is still awaiting his first win of the season, following an opening day 1-0 home loss to Arsenal and a disappointing 1-1 draw away at Fulham. United's next challenge is a home game against Premier League newcomers Burnley on Saturday, before the international break. A short journey to Manchester City follows.",
      "Meanwhile, Liverpool are preparing for an early season title showdown with Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, with Slot's team boasting two wins from two games so far.",
      "After their midweek humiliation to Grimsby, United will now view the match against the Clarets as a must-win to get their season on track.",

      "Manchester United suffered a major setback after they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "The home side opened the scoring when Charles Vernam's shot beat Andre Onana at the near post. Then, just eight minutes later, the United goalkeeper was at fault again, failing to deal with a cross that allowed Tyrell Warren to bundle the ball into an empty net.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo netted his first goal for the club with 15 minutes remaining, before Harry Maguire equalised for United with a header in the 89th minute. In the penalty shootout, misses from Clarke Oduor and Matheus Cunha took the contest to sudden death.",
      "Ultimately, it was Mbeumo who missed the decisive spot-kick, handing Grimsby a dramatic 12-11 victory. And below is a look at what the national media had to say on events at Blundell Park.",
      "'Manchester United sink to new low after losing penalty shoot-out to Grimsby'",
      "The Telegraph's Mike McGrath wrote: \"This infamous defeat amid lightning and thunderstorms in Cleethorpes only adds weight to Ruben Amorim’s assessment that we are watching the worst team in Manchester United’s history. The unrestrained joy of Grimsby's celebrations should be the lasting memory of this League Cup tie but it will inevitably be United sinking to one of their lowest moments in the modern era.",
      "\"Amorim was goaded by home fans, suggesting he would be sacked in the morning. The Portuguese coach will last longer, yet this embarrassing giant-killing will lead to questions over whether this team are set up to win matches in English football. Up against their League Two opponents, they looked shell-shocked facing players with more will to win. While they mounted a comeback from 2-0 down to force penalties, they had clearly done no homework on spot kicks as Andre Onana seemed to be jumping away from the ball as each strike found the net.",
      "\"Some of the best talent at Amorim’s disposal has left or is leaving the club, while those who have remained are not getting used properly. United’s team were littered with expensive signings and full internationals, yet they fell short in the basics of the game to a team 56 places below them in the football pyramid. They were battered like the fish brought into the nearby port.\"",
      "'Man United humiliated by Grimsby in shoot-out epic after Onana howler'",
      "Paul Hirst of The Times wrote: \"The Main Stand at Blundell Park has experienced some sights and sounds in its 124-year existence, but it has never heard a roar like the one that bellowed around this ground after Bryan Mbeumo missed the penalty that condemned Manchester United to one of the most embarrassing defeats in their history. When Mbeumo’s penalty struck the bar, giving Grimsby Town a 12-11 penalty shoot-out win, mums and dads in the home end hoisted their young ones in the air, mates wearing black-and-white shirts embraced and many of them dabbed a tear from their eye.",
      "\"Never have they experienced such a feeling, but then again, never have Grimsby put a club with such history as United to the sword. As the celebrations broke out, five yards in front of this grand old Victorian stand stood Ruben Amorim, drenched and demoralised after watching his team defeated by League Two opposition. Amorim wants to get his team back into Europe. He will not be able to qualify through the Carabao Cup because his pathetic excuse of a team fell at the first hurdle in one of the greatest shocks that this competition has ever known.",
      "\"So much for the pre-season optimism surrounding United. This was an even more embarrassing loss than other shock defeats, such as the one to MK Dons 11 years ago. Grimsby did not fluke their way to this shock win. They did not put ten men behind the ball and nick two lucky goals. They deserved to win, they had more quality, more composure, more desire and they looked more tactically astute. Those last two points in particular should worry Amorim’s paymasters the most. How can a team of the fourth division press the United defence into submission? How can they make Benjamin Sesko look so poor. And why was the Slovenian the last outfield player to take a penalty in the XI?\"",
      "'Glorious Grimsby humiliate Man United with shootout victory'",
      "Jamie Jackson of The Guardian wrote: \"Manchester United – bloody hell. After a quasi-farcical display that somehow pulled them back to 2-2 and penalties, Ruben Amorim’s rabble lost a fevered shootout 12-11.. Amorim’s men lost it – so the inquest begins. The head coach and his side hobble next to the visit of Burnley on Saturday. It does not need a vivid imagination to picture United losing that one too and extending their winless run to the opening four outings of an already stricken campaign.",
      "\"Amorim may survive a defeat at Old Trafford – he has just overseen a £200m-plus summer spend, after all – but the bottom line is this: nine months into the job the head coach continues to put out a team that lack verve, flair, solidity and anything approaching a discernible pattern of play. After the farrago of his side’s performance Amorim stood pitchside and was regaled with jubilant verses of 'you’re getting sacked in the morning': this cruel wit sharply crystallises the state United are in – and their coach is culpable.",
      "\"Cue a Grimsby support in party mode, their taunts a cutting 'can we play you every week', and 'Premier League/you’re having a laugh'. They had a point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest. When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too. Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance and when Diallo was flagged offside his manager dipped his head in anguish – a regular sensation for him.\"",

      "Pete Hall of The Independent wrote: \"Manchester United getting battered in Grimsby is a headline that writes itself. But nothing plucked from the North Sea has ever been treated to this kind of humiliation. Four hundred million pounds. 711 Premier League appearances between them. And that was just the starting XI. This was not your bog-standard cup giant-killing, when a plucky minnow overcomes an elite top-flight side who have rested their 11 best players.",
      "\"Grimsby Town, three divisions below, played the might of Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, off the park for long periods of a football match. They did not weather an almighty westerly storm. Their goalkeeper did not have to have the game of his life. They deserved their place in the history books. But be under no illusion, sneaking through to a shootout thanks to a Harry Maguire header at the death, when you have your entire attacking arsenal on the pitch, is humiliating enough.",
      "\"Never mind getting sacked in the morning, Ruben Amorim must be considering walking after this. How much more can one man take? Just when you thought Manchester United couldn’t make things any worse, they remain the gift that keeps on giving. You couldn’t tell as the match got underway. United were second to everything.\"",

      "A little over three months after Ruben Amorim told Alejandro Garnacho to find a new club in front of his teammates, the 21-year-old is on his way to Chelsea for £40m. Any chance you’ve backed the wrong horse, lads?",
      "It’s a transfer which we’re now in danger of seeing as a Manchester United win but should unquestionably be viewed as a huge missed opportunity for the Red Devils and yet another significant blot on the copybook of their under pressure manager. Just imagine how this move would have been viewed when Amorim first arrived in November.",
      "Negotiations with Chelsea have been fruitful for United. They quoted £50m for their academy graduate, Chelsea came in at £25m, and BlueCo have ended up paying a £40m fixed fee, with the deal also including a 10 per cent sell-on clause which could prove very worthwhile for United should Chelsea continue to treat the transfer market like a car boot sale.",
      "Quite staggeringly, as well as the sale marking the largest for a United academy graduate, it’s also the fourth largest in United’s history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. It still feels significantly lower than his value.",
      "Chelsea will require no marked improvement – or any at all – on what Garnacho achieved last season, with ten goals and ten assists in all competitions, to make a profit on him next summer should the Stamford Bridge saloon doors continue to swing unencumbered. Anthony Elanga got 18 goal contributions before Newcastle bought him for £52m. Chelsea sold Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £48m after just 15.",
      "And that’s what Garnacho produced under a manager who never fancied him. His 58 appearances for United were a product of long-term absences for Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad Diallo, while Marcus Rashford and Antony leaving on loan in January left Amorim very little option but to play Garnacho. He found a way in the Europa League final though.",
      "That was the final straw for Garnacho, who called out their “sh*t season” after playing just 19 minutes of the defeat to Tottenham having started every knockout game to help United get there. He then ensured bridges were burned entirely by wearing Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt over the summer and insisting he would rather not play football this season at all than work under Amorim again.",

      "It’s easy to suggest United are better off without his petulance, and many fans over the summer will no doubt have seen their manager’s call to rid the club of a ‘bad apple’ as a good one. But we wonder if, amid the backdrop of a new nadir for Amorim in the form of defeat to League Two Grimsby Town to prompt calls for his sacking, whether United fans able to pause and reflect on their manager’s awful reign at Old Trafford are now thinking about the damage he’s done to their football club.",
      "United named Garnacho as one of three ‘untouchable’ players shortly before he arrived, one of the great hopes of the future along with Rasmus Hojlund, who’s now also on his way out of the club, and Kobbie Mainoo, who wants out, with any hope that he won’t leave resting on the Amorim sack preceding the next transfer window. Would Marcus Rashford currently be playing for Barcelona had any other manager replace Erik ten Hag? Doubt it.",
      "Were Manchester United considered better off with the quality we had seen from Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo when Amorim first arrived, along with their high ceilings for improvement, or now with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko? It’s at best a toss up and it’s certainly not the £100m+ upgrade the net spend will suggest it is when all is said and done.",
      "Garnacho’s departure will be tinged with sadness and regret for many, given his goal in the FA Cup final win over Manchester City in 2024, his masterful overhead kick at Goodison Park and plenty of other off-your-seat moments besides in what was an all-too brief time at Old Trafford for a player tipped for the very top almost from the very first time he stepped onto the pitch.",
      "And while his infantile actions may also leave some with a sense of relief at him now being Chelsea’s problem, there’s at least as good a chance he will fly as flop at Stamford Bridge, which will leave Manchester United fans wondering whether they backed the right horse in Amorim, who looks set to be taken out back anyway, after he’s turned Garnacho and his fellow Red Devil untouchables into pariahs in the space of eight months.",

      "There was a tone change in Ruben Amorim’s post-Grimsby debrief and for the first time, he hinted that he may not be the solution to the curse of Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is doomed and dead last in our ranking of all seven Manchester United managers since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.",

But then one of the goalkeepers does something stupid and the team melts.",

With a midfield as well they quite conceivably have 3 wins from three (though I wouldn’t have bet on it).",

Hiding when your team is taking penalties is absolutely pathetic and gives zero confidence to your team. And if nothing else he should have to endure this when he makes us put up with watching absolute dross on a twice weekly basis. I don’t think he’s getting a midfielder so he needs to get over himself quickly and figure out how to get the best out of what he’s got. Maybe he is? Who knows.",

      "Unfortunately at Man U it does seem that there are too many still that are not on the same page, and has been the case for a long while for different reasons. Ronaldo, Rashford, Sancho, Garnacho, Bruno, Mainoo (to sell or not), Mount (fitness), Onana (mistakes), Mourinho, LVG, Solskaer, Amorim, Glazers, Woodward, Ratcliffe, fans, media all causing their own levels of chaos and disharmony. It’s the Owners/Players/Managers, they are all equally to blame for the mess.",

Some more of the same and the club would have tipped over the edge and hit freefall. The harder we tried the deeper the hole we kept digging ourselves into. And again this was not the fault of one element, rather a mess compounded by ownership, management, players, tactics, fans and media. How this has turned around is nothing short of a miracle, and while credit should be shared amongst all involved, the catalyst for the change was Mikel Arteta.",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",

But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely.

      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",

      "United conspired to go 2-0 down to League Two Grimsby Town only to give their fans a small sliver of hope by pushing the game to penalties. Football being the relentless source of punishment that it is made United fans sit through – and the rest of us delight in – 26 penalties that resulted in £65m Bryan Mbeumo missing the decisive kick, all while Amorim sat alone with his head down in the dugout.",
      "The whole night was an examination of how far a man can be bent before he breaks. 300 days on from his appointment, the Amorim in front of the cameras sure looks the same as the one that arrived, but his whole demeanour has changed.",
      "Back in November, Amorim’s first interview came with Gary Neville on Sky, the biggest of free hits for the new United boss. He was smiling, no bags under his eyes, making jokes about Manchester providing the perfect conditions to train in.",
      "The 39-year-old at the time spoke of a dream for the club, the return to Fergie’s United. He said there was a connection with the club, even laughing about how much media he has had to do. Now that media has become a near-daily examination of a sinking ship.",

      "“We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United,” he said after a 3-1 defeat against Brighton in January. “I know you want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.",
      "“Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United, imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that. I am not going to change [his 3-4-3 system], no matter what. I know we can succeed but we need to survive this moment. I am not naive. We need to survive now.”",
      "Even then, it was an alarming admission – one that made United fans put their heads in their hands and the rest of the world laugh at the latest episode of the Old Trafford soap opera. The reason as to why it was so shocking is that managers do not tend to point the finger at themselves so often – just look at Amorim’s Portuguese compatriot Jose Mourinho.",
      "The man who was once where Amorim is now was a master of deflecting blame. Referees, star players not performing, even medical staff have all been put in Jose’s spotlight, long before he admitted he had anything to do with the problem. Sir Alex was the same, as are countless other managers.",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, was happy to make himself public enemy no.1.",
      "But even in that admission, Amorim’s pronoun choice was key. “We are the worst team.” “We need to survive now.” “We can succeed”.",
      "That theme was not unique to the Brighton game either. In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe called some of the players “not good enough and probably overpaid”, clearly pointing the gun at the squad. Amorim decided to step in front of the bullet.",
      "“I think if we are being honest, everybody – me and the players – we are underperforming this season, so we can change that,” Amorim said.",
      "Amorim’s first season in charge ended with the calamity of losing the Europa League final to a Tottenham side that finished 17th, in a battle of managers wedded to their idea (it’s who we are mate).",
      "Ange paid with his job, Amorim may have sensed he was safe, for now.",
      "His words as the white-and-blue confetti fell were notable. Amorim defended himself but said he still believed he was the best man for the job, going as far as saying he would walk away without compensation should the board wish to get rid. A decision that would have cost his bank balance around £11.9m.",
      "“In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself,” he said, looking a lot more beleaguered than when he first arrived. “It’s not my style, I cannot do it. It’s really hard for me.",
      "“I have nothing to show to the fans to say, I am going to improve because of this, I will not do that. In this moment, it is faith. Let’s see.",
      "“I’m always open, if the board and the fans feel I am not the right guy I will go in the next day without any conversation of compensation.",
      "“Yes, I am confident I am still the guy, more than the beginning.",
      "“I know the patience of the fans is going to be really short in the next season but I guarantee you I will not quit. I will not go away, I am really confident.",
      "“I’m not worried about that. If they (the club) say ‘Ruben, it is better to change’ I will leave the next day with no compensation.",
      "“I rely so much on my confidence I am not worried about that. The biggest pain is to lose the game and lose this final, not to give something to the fans and my players.",
      "“I am really confident with myself and I will continue to do my job if the board wants me.”",
      "The board did want him, backing him with a summer spend of almost £300m in transfers but even if the opening game against Arsenal provided hope, subsequent matches make it feel like last season all over again.",
      "Losing to Grimsby, a town with a population smaller than Old Trafford’s capacity and one which Amorim would perhaps not even have heard of before the draw was made, may well have been the last straw – not for the United hierarchy but for Amorim himself.",
      "For the first time, Amorim pointed the fingers at the players, saying they “spoke really loud today about what they want.”",
      "“Everything [was wrong]. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened – it’s a problem in our club. We should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans. I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.",
      "“In the penalties, the feeling is the same. I think football was really fair today – the best team won.",
      "“That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things and very important things but I have nothing to say.",
      "“At half-time, I said: ‘We have 45 minutes to try to win the game.’ In the first half, I told them that they were speaking really loud to me – I understand what you are doing, what I am seeing. Let’s try to change that in the last 45 minutes.”",
      "His demeanour was also far removed from his first arrival in Manchester. With Neville, he sat with broad shoulders, smiling and looking Neville in the eyes.

      "“If we don’t show up, something has to change, and you’re not going to change 22 players again. We need to be different and that is the job of the coach and you can see that nothing changed.”",
      "Notably, there was also no mention of walking away without his £11.9m…",
      "It may have been something said in the heat of the moment, but Grimsby away may be looked back upon as the defining moment of Amorim’s tenure, the time when he realised that the faces and players can change but there is something about modern era United that is rotten.",
      "He has a team that either doesn’t understand or doesn’t want to understand his tactics. He has problems with the goalkeeper. He has five players very publicly in the bomb squad with only one having secured a loan move away. He has an academy graduate favourite that he doesn’t rate. He has the brightest of spotlights on him with a long line of ex-players and pundits waiting to be the latest to stick the knife in.",
      "To become a manager, you have to have quite the ego, which is why they so rarely walk away. Well, that and the compensation.",
      "There is always the belief that no matter how bad it is, things can still be saved but Amorim’s comments on Wednesday for the first time looked like someone not ready to be jumped but one hoping to be pushed.",

      "Who’d be Manchester United manager, eh? Someone eyeing a delicious compensation package, probably…",
      "It’s all gone sour under current head coach Ruben Amorim, who took on the poisoned chalice last November and boasts a worse win percentage in the Premier League than Graham Potter at West Ham.",
      "The Portuguese reached a sack-worthy new nadir as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two opposition.",
      "Amorim is the seventh manager appointed since Sir Alex Ferguson retired as a title winner in 2013. We’ve ranked them all.",
      "",
      "To be fair to Amorim, he wanted to join at the end of 2024/25 and was given a now-or-never ultimatum from CEO Omar Berrada. But after a full pre-season, over £300million in new signings, and nine months of knowing the players and personalities he’s working with, there’s no excuse for losing to and being outplayed by League Two Grimsby bloody Town.",
      "It’s remarkable to see this club make the same mistake over and over. They gave Erik ten Hag a club-record war chest in his first summer, which didn’t look like an awful idea when United went on to finish third in the Premier League and win the Carabao Cup. He was then heavily backed again in 2023 and when it all went to pot, the club was left with a bunch of players unsuited to Amorim’s system.",
      "System is a keyword in Amorim’s tenure. Not having his players was a constant excuse throughout 24/25, even though a manager deemed viable for the Man United job should be expected to get a tune out of an £800m squad full of international footballers. The whole 3-4-2-1 schtick has been Amorim’s downfall from day one. His stubbornness, unwillingness, or simply put, inability to adapt is what will lose the 40-year-old his job.",
      "When the United hierarchy put their pride to one side and realise he’s not the man for the job, it will cost an absolute fortune, just as it did to bring him from Sporting. That’s a key part of their stubbornness in inevitably sticking with Amorim. They don’t want to look stupid and inept, though that ship might’ve sailed a long time ago.",
      "Amorim’s United look absolutely terrible. An actual defeat on matchday one to Arsenal deceived us into thinking they might be quite good this season after a positive pre-season in which Luke Shaw claimed the Red Devils could win the Premier League. Imagine Adam Smith claiming Bournemouth could win the league. He’d be laughed into the Channel, yet Bournemouth finished a whole six places above Amorim’s side last season.",
      "Finishing 15th with 18 defeats and a -10 goal difference is astonishing. And then Amorim bottled the Europa League final and a chance at £100m and Champions League football. Ultimately, that could’ve been the worst possible outcome, because the embarrassment might’ve been enough for Amorim’s head to explode had they qualified for Europe’s premier competition and met teams like Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich in a competitive setting.",
      "That Europa final defeat was supposed to leave United hamstrung this summer, yet they’ve spent over £60m on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and over £70m on a striker scared to take a penalty against a League Two team. That sort of backing of a wildly underperforming head coach, who’s shown no sign that he’ll be a success, is astonishing and outright idiotic.",
      "Look at Liverpool, for instance. With Jurgen Klopp, it was clear there was something there and they waited to spend big money on the playing squad — and look at what happened when they did. Then Arne Slot came in, got backed with a £12m back-up winger, won the title at a canter, and has now been backed with a lucrative transfer window. That’s because it’s clear that he’s a good manager. A title-winning manager. Amorim won bugger all and led Manchester United Football Club to fifteenth.",
      "The football is dire, the results are even worse, but yes, everything will be fine after Amorim spends another £100m on a goalkeeper and midfielder.",
      "",
      "On one hand, you can say Moyes was always destined to fail given the monumental challenge of replacing Ferguson, but he still inherited a Premier League-winning squad and turned them into a group incapable of challenging for Champions League qualification.",
      "The United board put a lot of faith in Ferguson’s recommendation, handing Moyes a whopping six-year contract. He lasted a grand total of 10 months after winning 26 of 51 matches across all competitions, with the reigning champions sat seventh in the Premier League.",
      "Moyes did, at least, beat Wigan Athletic in the Community Shield, but that wasn’t enough to stop him being the club’s first managerial sacking since November 1986.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Hojlund, Sancho, Antony awful, but Mourinho buy bottom\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’\n👉 ‘Looking like a right plonker’ – What the pundits had to say about Ruben Amorim and his tactics board",
      "",
      "Man Utd brought in gegenpressing extraordinaire Rangnick to help steady the ship following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22. His appointment was made with the view of his stepping into a role behind the scenes, where he appeared to be better suited. Ten Hag had other ideas, though, and did not give the thought of working with Rangnick the time of day when he arrived from Ajax in May 2022.",
      "Rangnick’s time at Old Trafford epitomised the colossal mess at the club. He only took the manager job to become a consultant months later, which he probably would have been excellent at, only for him to leave before getting the chance, swiftly becoming Austria manager after entering free agency.",
      "The German spoke well — almost too well at times — saying the sort of thing the Manchester United hierarchy did not want to hear. His “open-heart surgery” claim had a brutal truth to it and did not go down well.",
      "On the pitch, results did not improve following Rangnick’s arrival and United ended up finishing sixth in the league, 13 points off fourth.",
      "",
      "From his rants in press conferences to throwing himself on the ground in remonstration to the fourth official after an alleged Alexis Sanchez dive, Van Gaal brought light to Our League, and for that, we will forever be grateful.",
      "While the experienced Dutch manager entertained the masses with his antics, his football — which does have an element of importance — left a lot to be desired. He was very pragmatic and adopted the patient, possession-based approach that has served him well throughout his career. That’s the nice way of putting it. More bluntly, it was dull as f**k.",
      "Said style did bring an FA Cup to Old Trafford, the first trophy post-Fergie. And the club’s hierarchy was so thankful to Van Gaal that they decided to sack him straight after the Wembley triumph.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag should have been sacked at the end of 2023/24 after the club’s worst finish in Premier League history. An unlikely FA Cup final win over Manchester City saved him. The club spoke to a few managers, yet Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided to extend the Dutchman’s contract after he and his minions swallowed his mitigation around injuries.",
      "It proved to be the silly decision we all knew it was at the time. The summer transfer window was filled with promise but none of the new faces impressed and the football did not improve. In fact, you could say it somehow got worse.",
      "Ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first campaign, which went along nicely with a top-three finish in the league and an FA Cup final, which his side lost to Man City. His second season was a direct contrast: beating Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley after shambling their way to eighth in the Premier League.",
      "The 2023/24 Champions League campaign was truly awful, finishing bottom of a group when it seemed harder not to. Their Carabao Cup defence ended painfully when the Red Devils were hammered by Newcastle United — the team they beat in the previous season’s final — at home, and results in the Premier League were mind-bogglingly inconsistent.",
      "Still, on paper, two trophies in two seasons is a fine return. On grass, it was a different story. Ten Hag’s dismissal was inevitable and one of many clear signs that Ratcliffe might not know what he’s doing.",
      "",
      "Say what you want about the man. Take into account all of the semi-final defeats. Do whatever you want, mate. We don’t care. United played their best football post-Fergie under Solskjaer, who was sacked in November 2021 after a harrowing defeat at Watford.",
      "The club legend got the job full-time after a mightily impressive spell as caretaker boss that included an iconic Champions League comeback away to Paris Saint-Germain, to which Rio Ferdinand reacted in a completely normal manner:",
      "Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there – given what he’s done since he’s come in – and let him sign the contract and go. Ole’s at the wheel, man – he’s doing his thing. Man United are back!",
      "In fairness, we all egged Man Utd on. He was having a ball at the wheel during his caretaker stint but his permanent spell eventually became a write-off.",
      "Solskjaer did bring the best out of Bruno Fernandes, giving him the freedom to express himself, and the Portuguese thrived as a result. He even made Anthony Martial look like a competent footballer. The comeback wins, counter-attacking football, and incredible 20-minute spurts in games when United would kill the opposition were the highlights of a fun time with the Norwegian at the helm.",
      "",
      "The Special One got the job after Van Gaal’s sacking and has been the club’s most successful boss since Ferguson retired in 2013. Again, his football was far from incredible to watch, but it provided results in a results business.",
      "His first season saw Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic shine as the Red Devils won the Carabao Cup and Europa League. They might’ve finished sixth in the Premier League, but that was insignificant as Europa glory brought the club Champions League football anyway.",
      "The following season brought two-time Champions League-winning manager Mourinho one of his “greatest” achievements: finishing second in the Premier League, 19 points behind centurions Manchester City.",
      "As it usually does, things went sour in Mourinho’s third season in charge, losing his job in December 2018, which saw Solskjaer take charge.",

      "And GiveMeSport now claims that ‘potential plans to replace Ruben Amorim as manager have been leaked’ with his sack now looking ‘inevitable’.",
      "It is understood that ‘there is a shortlist in place if they end up making the decision to sack Amorim’ and that ‘two of the names on the official shortlist are Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola, along with others’.",

      "Manchester United decided not to sack Ruben Amorim…in May. So that’s one sack decision. But then he did that thing at Grimsby.",
      "What was that thing? Well, we wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise – you really will barely believe it.",
      "Of course there is mileage in hinting that Ruben Amorim could get the sack after that shambles (looky here) but there’s a big difference between suggesting that Manchester United’s utter crapness should see the Portuguese spoofer sacked, and making the claim that a ‘decision’ has been made.",
      "This from SPORTbible might well be one of the worst we have seen of its ilk, published just minutes after Manchester United’s exit to Grimsby was confirmed:",
      "Man Utd make Ruben Amorim sack decision after humiliating defeat by Grimsby",
      "Are we supposed to believe that they quickly made this momentous decision and then called SPORTbible’s Marcus Chan with the news within minutes of Bryan Mbeumo hitting the bar?",

      "It’s ‘been mentioned’, folks. And specifically it’s been ‘mentioned’ before the Grimsby defeat. So their stance on sacking Amorim ‘after humiliating defeat to Grimsby’ was in place way before that humiliating defeat. Like the rest of us, they obviously saw it coming.",
      "So how long before this dismal defeat had their communicated this sack stance?",
      "Back in May, before United’s 1-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, it was claimed that Amorim’s job was safe.",
      "A report from The Times claimed that United would stick with Amorim regardless of the result of the Europa League final.",
      "It was suggested that, unless Amorim resigns, he would be the man to lead United in the 25/26 season as his job was ‘under no threat at all’.",

      "The Red Devils paid £74m to bring the striker to the club, but his full debut came during an embarrassing loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, heaping even more pressure on the already under-fire Ruben Amorim.",
      "As he pointed out, Amorim was done no favours by his players, with only Harry Maguire putting in what could even come close to being described as a good performance, but a particular problem player was the new summer signing Sesko.",
      "After a weekend display against Fulham that saw Gary Neville describe the Slovenian as “nowhere near”, Sesko did not do much to prove the pundit wrong, registering a Fotmob rating of 5.8, a score only Andrea Onana failed to beat.",
      "As such, the striker has been put in the crosshairs, but while his performance was described as ‘anonymous’, his most egregious offence for many came in the shootout when nine other United players stepped up before him.",
      "The Independent said: ‘Perhaps nothing summed up another spineless showing more than Benjamin Sesko, United’s new £74m central striker, the one tasked with firing the goals to restore United to their former glories, stepping up second-from-last – just before Onana – to take his spot kick.’",

      "While the Mail said: ‘It felt like a big night for Sesko too on his full debut after a big-money move from RB Leipzig and two rather subdued appearances off the bench against Arsenal and Fulham. The Slovenian was largely anonymous and then curiously chose to be the last outfield player to step up in the shootout. Not exactly the kind of confidence you expect from a £74m striker.’",
      "The Express were particularly critical, giving him a 1 in their player ratings and saying he was ‘unconvincing’.",
      "‘His first start since a £74million transfer to United. Talk about a rough welcome… Unconvincing is an understatement. Clearly didn’t fancy a penalty, either.’",
      "The Sun said the 6ft 5’ striker was ‘way off it’ and said that if he was given leniency for a slow start in the Premier League, you cannot use the same excuse against a League Two side.",
      "‘I know the talk has been that the Slovenian ace has not been up to pace for the Prem, but he didn’t give a good account of himself against English rough-houses here.",
      "‘He towered over the League Two side’s back-line, but United hardly made use of it.",

      "‘The £74 million striker went 10th in the shootout. Bizarre.’",
      "‘Out of kilter with his new teammates for most of the evening but came closest to scoring in the first half. Slotted in his penalty.’",
      "The Guardian though said even the sight of Sesko shooting was a reminder that United were allowed to attack.",

      "READ: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Hojlund, Sancho, Antony awful, but Mourinho buy bottom",

      "Walcott continued: “Get him off penalty duties, get him off the captain’s armband perhaps? Because, for me, if that was another player, you think [Cristiano] Ronaldo is going to? [react the same way] absolutely no chance, do you think Odegaard at Arsenal? [would react the same way] absolutely no chance. Bruno Fernandes’ reaction has really surprised me but it’s got us talking about that instead of the result.”",

Either way, Newcastle’s desperation is showing as a third ‘offer’ worth £60m is set to be submitted after their £55m bid was rejected on Tuesday.

His only whiff of success was fluking his way to the Europa League final thanks to opposition players being sent off at crucial moments in the quarter- and semi-finals. And there – he lost to Spurs. Who then fired their manager. Nothing more needs to be said, really.",
      "But while I’m here, I’d like to say more regardless: Amoron’s system doesn’t work. Not in the Premier League, clearly. Not against Grimsby. Only in Europe against ten men. I really can’t fathom how he had any success in Portugal – I guess he must just have had by far the best players in the league, which makes sense since Arsenal have just spent quite a lot of money on their star striker.",
      "To call it disjointed would be inaccurate as it implies that the system ever had joints in the first place. The one idea in place is to try to make progress down the wings, which is easily countered by the opposition moving an extra player out there. This happened over and over again against Fulham, in another absolutely awful performance. United then try to move the ball to the centre of the pitch, which is always, relatively speaking, deserted. The opposition intercept, break, very easily get to United’s area, and the three-man defence make a block or a tackle and look flustered. Often a corner is conceded, which leads to a guaranteed goal thanks to Onanism or Badidea being born with their hands on back to front.",
      "Surely – surely? – tonight’s result will alert Big Jim the Business Genius/Mechanical Asset Stripper to the fact that Amoron is a terrible, terrible manager. A manager who is either aware that his system isn’t working and too stubborn to change his approach, or who somehow hasn’t realised that his system doesn’t work. Either way, he has to go. At this stage I don’t think I’ve disliked anyone in football as much as I dislike Amoron at the moment. Even Sergio Ramos, for goodness’ sake! Steven Gerrard! Maybe not Steven Gerrard actually. But it’s close.",
      "With the new (long overdue) training ground, and (in theory) exciting new players in the squad, there’s scope for positivity at the club. It won’t happen with the joyless, brainless, directionless, and wildly unsuccessful football played under the current manager. If United can somehow persuade Oliver Glasner or Andoni Iraola to join, I’ll be absolutely delighted. The idea of targeting proven Premier League players in Cunha and Mbuemo (penalty miss aside) is a good one – the club needs to follow suit with the manager.",
      "To pre-empt opposition fans: there’s a reasonable chance that even with a new manager, all the old failings will continue. Of course that’s true. But there’s nothing to be gained sticking with a proven failure, particularly one who keeps alienating promising young players. Like the proverbial stopped clock, even the United board will get it right eventually, and we might see some nice football again.

The reality is clear – Amorim has failed to make the impact expected of a Manchester United manager, and the club risks further decline if decisive action is not taken soon.",

His insistence on deploying the 3-4-2-1 formation has been widely criticized for being rigid and unsuitable for the squad at his disposal. Despite having talented attacking players, the system often leaves United looking predictable, disjointed, and lacking creativity in the final third. Instead of enhancing the team’s strengths, Amorim’s setup appears to stifle them.",
      "The performances on the pitch tell a worrying story. United’s defensive frailties remain unsolved, the midfield lacks balance, and the attack continues to be inconsistent. More alarmingly, the overall quality of play has regressed compared to his predecessor, Erik ten Hag. While supporters hoped for progress, what they have witnessed instead is stagnation, if not outright decline.",
      "Amorim has also been described as stubborn and unwilling to compromise. His reluctance to adjust his approach – even when results and performances demand it – raises serious doubts about his suitability to lead a club of Manchester United’s stature. The Premier League demands flexibility, adaptability, and the courage to make tough decisions. At the moment, Amorim appears to lack those qualities.",
      "Manchester United is at a crossroads. Continuing under Amorim risks wasting another season, further damaging the club’s reputation, and potentially losing the faith of both players and fans. The longer the hierarchy delays, the harder it will be to repair the damage. A proactive decision to part ways with Amorim could provide United with the opportunity to reset before it is too late.",
      "Manchester United is a club built on ambition, resilience, and high standards. Unfortunately, Ruben Amorim has not lived up to those expectations. To safeguard the club’s future and restore its competitiveness, the leadership must make the difficult but necessary choice: part ways with Ruben Amorim before the situation worsens beyond repair.\nBiswardi Hasbi",

      "Amorim is getting away with murder here. I still see people making excuses for him and I can’t believe it. This United team is sh*te but it’s nowhere near this bad. He’s doing his absolute best to hide their strengths and exacerbate their weaknesses. That’s the opposite of what any manager should be doing. The worst thing is that he’s gonna get fired and leave with a huge payday while a lot of people lost their jobs so Big Jim could scrape up some money to buy some players.",
      "As a rival, I should be enjoying this downfall but it’s getting closer to pity for me and I hate it. I want them to be rubbish but not this rubbish. I really don’t want to feel this much sympathy for their fans.\nAbdulazeez, Bristol",

      "Arsenal walking away from the Sesko deal should have been a red flag for Man Utd.",
      "One thing Berta and Arteta have done this season that requires huge applause is signing players with elite mentality and who love the club Arsenal. I’ll be honest, I was one of those who preferred Sesko to Gyokeres but after reading details of the transfers, I knew we had made the right choice. Arteta said one video call with Gyokeres convinced him. He didn’t care. He was convinced he would be the main man regardless of Havertz, Jesus and whoever Arsenal signs. He knew how hard of a step up it would be.",
      "Look at Eze. Man hasn’t stopped smiling since Saturday. Elite mentality. Guaranteed starter at Spurs but knew what he would bring to Arsenal. Look at Hincapie (not done yet but close). Who in their right mind joins a team that has the best CB partnership in the world. You won’t play. Doesn’t care. Wants only Arsenal. These are players who would bleed for the badge. In Arteta’s words, players who love the club through and through.",
      "Compare that to Man Utd. Driving away academy players. Players who understand what it means to play for Man Utd. Rashford, Garnacho, McTominay, now Mainoo. Signing players like Sesko who was just bullied by division 4 defenders. Looks mentally defeated and it’s only their 3rd game of the season. It showed when he refused to push for a move to Arsenal and it shows now on the pitch. Absolutely embarrassing. Man Utd don’t have players who would leave it all on the pitch. A sad decline but a hilarious end.\nDamola AFC Berlin Germany",

      "Andre Onana, if further proof were needed after last night’s shambles, is simply not good enough for a club with Man Utd’s targets. Neither is Bayindir at the stage of his development. One of the best in the world in that position is clearly not wanted at PSG and itchy for a move. How has this not already been resolved from both sides?",
      "Have Utd and Sir Jimmy, having invested a large amount in reinforcements, finally decided that’s enough money spent for now? Do they not now believe, after three games, that Amorim deserves further backing? Is the lack of CL football an absolute brick wall? City will possibly move Ederson on, sign Donnarumma unchallenged, he’ll make some outstanding, game-winning saves over the season and the fans on the quiet side of Manchester will bemoan City’s habit of buying all the best players and how unfair it all is.",
      "It is my belief that Donnarumma in goal from the first game of the season would see Utd on four points in the league, level with Arsenal, rather than the one that they currently have. Is it the answer to all of the problems at Old Trafford? Certainly not, but like Arsenal and their blindness to the striker issue until this Summer, it’s fixing the most prominent and obvious one.",
      "Also, while I’m here: Sesko taking the very last penalty of the outfield rotation last night was a disgrace. £75m of actual goal-scorer and he either hides or was not trusted by whomever decided the order of the takers. Really instills confidence, eh?\nMonsieur Monkey. Still in the sand",

      "Laughing aside, I feel like I just a little epiphany around Man Utd.",
      "Liverpool at the start of the Premier League got left behind. They failed to commercialise and made a Souness-sized mistake which ultimately set them back a long way.",
      "Fergie left Man Utd right at the start of the data revolution and I suspect nobody else at the club had given much thought to why they’d been winning for 20 straight years or how to maintain their advantage. They also filled the gap with Moyes who was a bit of a dinosaur and basically told them to cross it a lot instead of trying to actually be good at football.",
      "I’ve heard it said multiple times that their data team is considered one of the worst of the big 6 and I suspect clubs like Brighton are way ahead of them judging by how many brilliant signings they keep making. Maybe Ratcliffe will make the investment to catch up but how long will that take given all the other clubs aren’t standing still. Or will they actually have to try and find an entirely new edge if they’re ever to close the gap and who at Man Utd has the brilliance to do that?\nMinty, LFC",

      "But previous reports have suggested that doubts over that need have come from Amorim, whose off-season declaration of ‘trust’ in Onana was evidently misplaced on the basis of last season, while his claim only last week that he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” points to either a hugely worrying lack of knowledge as to what it takes to be a Manchester United No.1 or direction from the hierarchy to temper expectations over the club’s wherewithal to sign a replacement.",
      "And in any case, unless either Senne Lammens or Gianluigi Donnarumma can provide midfield stability while simultaneously holding the ball up and creating chances, United’s problems will not be solved by a new goalkeeper.",
      "We all got a bit carried away after United impressed against Arsenal and none more so than Amorim, who claimed – after losing, lest we forget – that “we proved that we can beat every team in the Premier League.”",
      "Not Fulham though, nor League Two Grimsby Town, who are three divisions and 56 places below Manchester United in the football pyramid and have a squad market value which is approximately four per cent of what their visitors paid for their new striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "His first start for the club won’t have convinced anyone that he’s any sort of upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who might just have scored had he had Sesko’s chance to score in stoppage time from four yards out and probably wouldn’t have been the last outfield player to take a penalty in the shootout. What was all that about? Not very Manchester United, is it now.",
      "And after Bryan Mbeumo came off the bench at half-time to join him and Matheus Cunha to complete the summer signing forward triumvirate, what was a burgeoning hope that Amorim may just have cobbled together a means to create and score enough goals for United is fading fast.",
      "Mbeumo opened his account with a fine probing dribble and clever finish into the far corner but Cunha missed his penalty to ensure United’s £74m shrinking violet of a No.9 had to take his before Mbeumo missed the crucial one. You really can write it.",
      "The problem in the minds of many is in midfield. Manuel Ugarte again staked his claim in a keenly contested battle to be the worst of all midfield signings made in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era before being hooked at half-time for Bruno Fernandes, which granted us all an ill-fated look at the captain and wantaway Kobbie Mainoo together in the double pivot.",
      "United did improve, but that felt as much to do with an inevitable increase in pressure from a Premier League side over a tiring League Two minnow as evidence of Mainoo-Fernandes being a viable future partnership. Amorim won’t have been convinced the uptick in creativity that did come was significant enough for him to make peace with the soft centre he’s worried about in Premier League games to come.",
      "But maybe it won’t matter for much longer what Amorim thinks. Maybe Mainoo just needs to wait out Amorim, because the image of him with head bowed on the bench as his ragtag bunch of expensively signed footballers got dumped out of a cup competition they’re only playing in at this point because he did such a terrible job last season will be a hard one to shake for the players, the fans and the owners, who may as well pull the trigger now, because if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Amorim’s Manchester United, there’s always a new nadir.",

      "Chelsea are ‘close to agreeing terms’ with Manchester United over a £40m deal for Alejandro Garnacho in what sounds like quite the deal for the Blues.",
      "United wanted £50m for the Argentinian, but as reported by The Telegraph, Ruben Amorim announcing to the world that there was no way back for Garnacho at Old Trafford ‘gave negotiations a different dynamic’. After Garnacho insisted it was ‘Chelsea or nothing’, BlueCo needed only to wait out United, and the Red Devils have duly wilted.",
      "We said last week amid reports that United would hold out for their asking price that Chelsea should push for much of that fee to be in add-ons, acting as ‘Pr*ck Protection’ in case Garnacho decided to post a picture of himself wearing the shirt of a rival club on social media or flipped the bird to the club’s fans, but Chelsea will consider £40m a more than fair price even given the potential for Garnacho not to kick on at Stamford Bridge.",
      "There’s a question as to whether Chelsea even need him given the arrival of Jamie Gittens this summer, with Pedro Neto and Joao Pedro also options for Enzo Maresca on the left, while the return of Mykhaylo Mudryk remains a possibility, albeit an uninspiring one.",
      "But as Chelsea have shown so impressively in this transfer window, with 12 player sales almost entirely cancelling out their eight arrivals to leave them with a net spend of almost zero, including three only signed last summer, they’re a club which sees footballers as commodities to be bought and sold, with a somewhat depressing lack of emotion involved in their decisions. Garnacho is simply a market opportunity they couldn’t miss out on.",
      "‘Chelsea have made a number of checks on his character and approach to the job, although the acceptance is that the proof will be in his performance’, according to The Telegraph. But a cut-price deal means Chelsea won’t need any improvement from Garnacho to make a tidy profit.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At the level of the deal as agreed, there is a realistic market for Garnacho beyond Chelsea should it not work out for him in west London. With only a few exceptions, Chelsea’s business is done with potential trading of the player further down the line should a transfer not work out.’",
      "MORE CHELSEA COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Barcelona set Chelsea ultimatum after Blues ‘formal offer’ as two signing conditions revealed\n👉 Chelsea transfer ‘falls through’ as player ‘fails medical’ ahead of agreed controversial move\n👉 Tottenham told to ‘move quickly and quietly’ to sign long-time Chelsea target",
      "Assuming he doesn’t upset the apple cart as he’s done under Ruben Amorim, and maybe even if he does but Chelsea don’t make such a big deal about it, the same return as last season of ten goals and ten assists will result in plenty of interest next summer.",
      "Noni Madueke got ten goals and five assists last season before Arsenal bought him for £48m. Anthony Elanga’s six goals and 12 assists to prompt Newcastle into his £52m signing. And Chelsea themselves signed Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for £48.5m after his 12 goals and five assists. Garnacho got more goal contributions than any of them and arguably has the highest ceiling.",
      "There’s a decent chance Garnacho will thrive at Chelsea – he’s a big talent who’s desperate to play for them – but the price tag offers a very savvy football club a safety net in a transfer which feels as much like a business transaction as a move for a player they’re convinced will make a big difference on the pitch.",
      "Let’s not forget Garnacho was a shining light for Manchester United when Ruben Amorim arrived. Any chance you’ve backed the wrong horse, guys?",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working hard to finalise’ a ‘blockbuster £120m double deal’ amid interest from Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’."

      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

You must have been to a hostile away game before; Liverpool have had loads in Europe over the years. Also, Ekitike’s off the ball trip on Tonali forced him to leave the field injured. It was the type of shithousery you’d expect to see when you watch the caveman united vs caveman athletic derby. To confirm, Newcastle are in the Champions League this season.",
      "2 ) Liverpool are a wonderful team and play some great football. Up until Gordon got himself red carded (rightfully so), Newcastle also played some nice football too but couldn’t score. When you go down to ten men, you need to change your tactics somewhat. You slow the game down, you focus on trying to win set pieces, this isn’t something Newcastle have invented, teams have done it forever. In fact, Liverpool tried several times to slow the game down, I think the referee had a word with Kerkez about time wasting over a throw in. Oh, and the change of tactic nearly worked. You are going to be very disappointed if you go to each game expecting every team to try and pass Liverpool off the park.",
      "As for being verbally aggressive, grow up, I certainly didn’t imagine VVD shouting in the face of the referee 3 times in the first 20 minutes or Gravenberch’s scissor tackle from behind on Bruno (most fouled player in the top 5 leagues last season) that he was cautioned for.",
      "3) All Isak is guilty of is not honouring the 6 year contract he signed 3 years ago, well that and faking an injury to avoid a preseason tour, making himself unavailable for games, going to train with his former club and posting content onto social media that damages the reputation of his employer (though I’ll let that slide what with the sportswashing and all). Yes, Liverpool is a bigger club, yes, they can pay him more money and yes, he’ll win more playing for them, but until they offer the money that Newcastle are willing to accept, he should at least act like a professional. Same for Wissa and anyone else in that position.",
      "4) If Newcastle were able to spend the way Man City or Chelsea was able to spend, then like it or not, they would be a superpower in waiting. If you can’t see that, then I suggest you give up football commentary and try to get Duncan and the boys back together for a Blue reunion tour. Maybe team up with Simply Red and call yourself Deep Purple.No doubt about it, the management structure within the club has been a disaster this year, not many Newcastle supporters will disagree with that. Staveley leaving, ill health of Darren Eales, Paul Mitchell stepping down and no obvious succession planning has each played a part. Prior to that, it was all going swimmingly.",
      "Quick responses now …\nUpset by a banner – anyone wearing a Suarez t-shirt?\nGet into them – sang it for years, you aren’t special!\nSnarling aggression – anyone get bitten?\nPlayacting – Salah ever won a penalty?\nLost a game at home – 10 men outplaying the champions, no shame in that.\nPicked up a suspension – A deserved one may I add.\nTreatment room overflowing – Nothing new there.\nAll because Liverpool bid for one of our players – More so because of how he’s acted since.

      "Again, with the booing – We booed every player (and the refs), whether they were born in the 90s, 00s or 10s (???). Do you want opposing fans to applaud your players when they score, again, grow up. Oh, and that’s some take, stating that the things stopping Newcastle becoming one of the footballing elites (whatever that is) is the fans booing, players being too committed in tackles and diving.",

      "– Newcastle playing “verbally aggressive” football. Errrr, what?",
      "– “Snarling aggression” and “turning football into a battlefield” sounds very much like what you can expect at Anfield when a stronger team comes to town. If you cross the line, you get what Anthony Gordon got. As per the rules. Nothing to see here.",
      "– City are “sleeping giants”? After one poor season, and one poor result this season? As you smarmily pointed out Lee, it’s August. Maybe heed your own words.",
      "– Accusing other teams of having a victim complex, only to then describe snatching a 100th-minute win against a team who’d been down to 10 for the previous 70 minutes as “poetic justice”? Jesus Christ. How many advantages do you need before you get down off your cross?",
      "To summarise, creating a hostile atmosphere makes a ground an intolerant hell hole unless it’s Anfield, you’re not allowed ruffle Liverpool players by fair means or foul cos diddums, and the league is sewn up because one bad result for anyone else immediately colours a 38 game season.",

      "Thursday 28 August 2025 19:07, UK",
      "Manchester United are arguably at their lowest ebb after an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were very much second-best against their fourth-tier opponents, falling 2-0 down at half-time. And while Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire rescued a 2-2 draw, they then crashed out after a marathon penalty shoot-out.",
      "After the game Amorim made some concerning comments, insisting his players \"spoke really loud to him\" and that \"something has to change\" - but adding he cannot change 22 players again.",
      "I watched the whole game and all the way through to the penalties and: hard work. You have to put in the hard work. You could be some of the most talented players in the world but you have to work hard.",
      "No disrespect to Grimsby, they shouldn't be on the same pitch as Man Utd. If Man Utd turn up with the attitude Grimsby had, there's only one result and everyone would have been turning over at half-time, looking for something else to watch. That wasn't the case.",
      "Half of them turned up thinking: 'I'm only playing because it's Grimsby. I won't be playing against Burnley on Saturday'. Instead of: 'When I walk off that game, those Grimsby fans and players will go: I didn't know he was that good.' That's not the case.",
      "The attitude stinks from half of them. Back in the day, there were shocks, the pitches were a joke. That pitch was immaculate and they should go out and destroy Grimsby.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't get to the top by just his talent. And if he has to work hard as one of the greatest players of all-time, why can't the Manchester United players? It's arrogance.",
      "Who can knock on the door this weekend and go: why am I not playing? And they all want to leave! Where are they going to go? Who's going to take them?",
      "When he said: my players talk really loud - that means he has seen enough to know that they're not really playing for him, in my opinion.",
      "Then he turned around and said 'I can't change all 22 players', [meaning] 'it will have to be me to leave'.",
      "I was a manager at Walsall. You just know, and you get a feeling, when things aren't right.",

      "He came in from Portugal to one of the biggest jobs in world football playing the way he played. Why would he change?",
      "He didn't want to come in during the middle of the season because he knew they were not his players. No wing-backs. Then he had to come in, it was a mad struggle and this season he hasn't got it.",

      "I will be shocked if he's still in charge if Man Utd don't beat Burnley. But they will beat Burnley! It's a nice game.",
      "Erik ten Hag had that as well: three or four games without a win and then second-bottom of the league came. They just won that game and then lost three or four games again.",
      "It's just going to keep on covering the cracks. They will be called Pollyfilla United!",
      "I don't think Amorim will be shy to go: 'I've had enough. I can't do anything. I've done what I can'.",
      "I don't think he is one to put himself through pain to get his pay-off. I don't know the man, but [the way he is] coming across, I think he's an honest man and will be honest with himself. But I think they will beat Burnley.",
      "For me, I would have said yes. You don't win league titles, World Cups or European Championships without good goalkeepers.",
      "Onana doesn't save points, the goalkeepers lose points at Man Utd. So as soon as you lose points, that's a worry.",
      "They need a new goalkeeper. I see Gianluigi Donnarumma's around - why don't they go for him? But again, they've used their money in other positions.",
      "They need legs in midfield. No one has ever won a tournament or league without legs in midfield.",
      "They bought Sesko for £70m and he's taking the 10th penalty? I thought he had a broken leg when he stepped up. I thought he must be that injured that he's taking the 10th penalty.",
      "And then I heard people saying that he didn't want to miss or take that pressure. He's a £70m player! He's coming to score goals for Man Utd to take them back to where they should belong and he's taking the 10th penalty?",
      "He has to be in the top five. He's taking a penalty from 12 yards and the goalkeeper can't come off his line!",

      "Should Manchester United stick with this Ruben Amorim project? As the club faces another crisis following their Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town, Adam Bate wonders whether all is lost if Amorim no longer believes...",
      "Thursday 28 August 2025 13:47, UK",
      "A new low? Quite possibly. Defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the club's long and storied history, to use a Ruben Amorim phrase, speaks loudly. Manchester United are at another crisis point just three winless games into the new season.",
      "Those at the top had hoped the nadir was behind them. Omar Berrada, United's chief executive, had said as much. \"As of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us.\" He had praised the \"very clear identity\" of Amorim, talked of a long-term vision.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe had proclaimed that the Portuguese was doing \"a great job\" in March and complained that everyone was expecting miracles. United supporters would settle for avoiding humiliation at Grimsby. The FA Cup is the only hope now. And this is August.",
      "There will be plenty persuaded by the argument that Amorim needs more time, that part of the problem at United over the dozen years of discontent since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure is that the club has been unable to stick to a plan, to see an idea through.",
      "There is logic to that thinking, particularly when the club has committed to this course enough to be dispensing with homegrown talents who do not fit Amorim's system. What sense in reshaping formation and club only to abandon the project so swiftly?",
      "The last vestiges of the previous regime are only just being swept away. Remember that image of Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho perched on the hoardings? The poster boys of the FA Cup victory last year on the periphery now.",
      "The dangers of flitting from one idea to the next are oft-discussed. Marcus Rashford might be the best or worst placed to comment depending on your view but he articulated the issue well in a recent interview. \"You end up in no-man's land,\" he said.",
      "The awkward issue for United's decision-makers is that the argument for continuity only makes sense if the man in whom this faith is placed still believes. The most worrying aspect of events at Blundell Park was the behaviour of the coach upon whom this rests.",
      "There was the sight of him shuffling his tactics board with his team two down to Grimsby. There was the spectacle of him steering clear of his own players before the penalty shoot-out and then being slumped in the dugout refusing to watch once it began.",
      "The memes are one thing but more significant were the words that followed. \"Something has to change,\" said Amorim in the aftermath of defeat. \"And you are not going to change 22 players again.\" This from a coach who has offered to leave before.",
      "\"I have nothing to say. That is the biggest problem.\" Indeed. Because there has been enough change of personnel on the pitch for Amorim to be beginning to take control of this situation by now. He finished the game with his new £200m forward trio out there.",
      "But Matheus Cunha was the first Manchester United player to miss, Bryan Mbeumo was the last. In between, there was the strange sight of Benjamin Sesko, the club's new £74m striker, being the very last outfield player out on the pitch to step up to take one.",
      "Both Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu, the latter as a specialist wing-back designed to fit his system, have come in since Amorim's appointment. Manuel Ugarte has worked with him before. More players are needed but it should be functioning better than this.",
      "The tactical inflexibility that saw Mason Mount deployed at left wing-back will be the focus of a lot of noise externally. But internally, the chief concern of both Amorim and those above him will be that the much-vaunted spirit and harmony has dissipated.",
      "That was the message of the summer coming out of the club, that there had been a change of mood to go with the new stadium plans and training-ground revamp. Luke Shaw spoke of the toxic environment of the past. This was a fresh start at United.",
      "\"It is completely different.\"",
      "The fragility of that has already been exposed. It survived defeat to Arsenal on the opening weekend because there were some positive signs, but a stuttering draw at Fulham was less convincing and this performance was as miserable as it gets.",
      "Already, the optimism has been undermined and United finding themselves lurching once more. Just hoping they can navigate a home fixture against Burnley, limp to that international break and take stock once the summer transfer window has closed.",
      "Time. That is at the heart of this. \"We have a game at the weekend, then we have two weeks and we will solve things.\" But that was what pre-season, Amorim's first, was supposed to do. Manchester City and Chelsea will be waiting for them on their return.",
      "And yet, still there is an appetite for all this to work, for a talented young coach who has lost more games than he has won at Manchester United to come good in the end, for an exciting new team to emerge stronger from this chastening experience.",
      "Those at the top are certainly invested. The men who saw themselves as part of the clean-up operation risk being seen as adding to the mess. The \"short-term pain\" to which Berrada had referred last season cannot be allowed to have been for nothing.",
      "But if Amorim himself has lost belief, it is already over.",

      "Thursday 28 August 2025 20:09, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim said \"something has to change\" after Manchester United's defeat to Grimsby Town, but that it could not be \"22 players again\".",
      "Man Utd suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Carabao Cup second round to the League Two club, losing 12-11 on penalties, having fought back from 2-0 down in the final 15 minutes, and Amorim repeatedly said afterwards \"the players spoke really loudly\" with their performance.",
      "Amorim has failed to win any of Manchester United's first three matches of the season despite signing a new front line in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who all featured in the tie, with the pressure growing ahead of their Premier League fixture at home to Burnley on Saturday.",
      "\"I am shocked because we are in the moment when we make a lot of changes, \" Amorim said on ITV. \"We try to fight a lot of things but then when we have these moments, we need to show up.",

      "\"It doesn't matter if we recover [from 2-0 down] or not. It's the signs the team made during the game. The beginning of the game.",
      "\"I know that the best team won, the only team that was on the pitch. The best players lose, because one team can win against any group of players.",
