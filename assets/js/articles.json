      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba was reportedly 'very open' to a move to Manchester United even though the midfielder end up not completing a switch to Old Trafford. The Red Devils failed to secure a central midfielder during the transfer window, having been heavily linked with signing Baleba for the majority of the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad decided to bide their time in their efforts to bolster their midfield with Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher mentioned as a potential target. United's aspirations clearly involve securing a deal for Baleba in the future.",
      "The Athletic have reported that personal terms have already been agreed between Baleba and United in anticipation that a move could still happen in the future. Fabrizio Romano also suggests that the player remains a player of interest to United heading into 2026, and the club were pleased to discover that the Brighton star was keen on a move over the summer, despite the lack of European football on offer.",
      "The 21-year-old was notably absent from Cameroon's squad during their victory over Eswatini, a match that saw both Bryan Mbeumo and Andre Onana take to the pitch. Mbeumo, a £71million signing for United this summer, provided an assist in a 3-0 victory for his country.",
      "It remains to be seen what United will have planned for their midfield revamp when the January transfer window opens. It seems unlikely that a move for Baleba could be possible in the middle of the season, and only time will tell if alternative targets emerge on the rumour mill between now and the New Year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has agreed to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on loan for the remainder of the season. And the 29-year-old will leave temporarily knowing he's had the backing of his team-mates through a tricky tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "The Cameroonian arrived from Inter Milan two years ago for £43.8million, and while he has shown glimpses of quality, errors have been plentiful and costly. Last season under Ruben Amorim, Onana came under heavy fire for performances in the Europa League, and added to these criticisms with a calamitous performance during the Red Devils' shock Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town last month.",
      "He is now set to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan in light of United signing Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens on deadline day for £18.2m. No fee or option to buy is included, and the move will be sealed once he returns from international duty. Onana says his goodbyes after enduring a difficult spell, but leaves knowing his team-mates have had his back and rate him highly.",
      "In 2024, Onana began building on a dismal first season in the Premier League, which saw him produce costly mistakes in the Champions League. Peer Diogo Dalot was asked about his growth from season one to season two, and replied with praise.",
      "\"At this club, because of the demands and the expectations we have here, it can be really easy for you to fall mentally and to feel really bad,\" stated Dalot. \"I think he found this balance of being really calm and really confident, and I think it shows on the pitch that he is really good.\"",
      "However, errors would return to the goalkeeper's game, and in December, he cost his club in back-to-back matches. After a questionable performance against Nottingham Forest, in which a long-range Morgan Gibbs-White strike was dealt with poorly, Onana made headlines for a Europa League error days later.",
      "Early in United's clash with Viktoria Plzen, Onana sold defender Matthijs de Ligt short with a pass and allowed United's opponents to open the scoring. The Red Devils did win 2-1, though captain Bruno Fernandes backed his shot-stopper after the full-time whistle.",
      "\"We have huge belief in Andre,\" said Fernandes. \"He knows he made a mistake, he's a clever guy. We don't need to tell him. He's going to help many times coming out from the back. We trust his qualities on the ball.\"",
      "The mistakes did not stop there. Roughly four months later, Onana would face intense scrutiny for a host of errors when United tackled Lyon in the same competition. During the first leg of the quarter-final tie, he was at fault for both goals in a 2-2 draw and was even dropped for a midweek match against Newcastle.",
      "He returned for the second leg, with both Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro throwing their weight behind the 29-year-old, indicating how much respect Onana's United peers have for him. The Red Devils progressed past Lyon dramatically before losing to Tottenham in the final 1-0.",
      "\"I think first and foremost, Andre has proven in his past that he is an excellent goalkeeper,\" Maguire commented. \"He has proven that at Inter, he has won numerous trophies and played in a Champions League final.",
      "\"During a career, you always have spells where you have ups and downs and find yourself a little bit out of form. It is about how you build yourself back in and find that confidence to perform again,\" he added, with Yoro stating: \"Now, Andre, we're with him, of course, we support him.\"",
      "Onana reciprocates such respect, as he told PA last year: \"In the beginning it was difficult. I am used to moving to [different] countries but it took me six months to feel good here. I was lucky because I have good team-mates, they were helping me.",
      "\"When I arrived here, I arrived as the best goalkeeper in the world and boom, it went down and you see how difficult football is sometimes. It depends on you if you want to stay down there or if you want to stand up and fight.",
      "\"But I decided to not stay there but to stand up and fight. Because I know who I am. I know what I did to arrive here and never forget what you did. Never stay too high but also don't stay too low, because at the end of the day, being a player for such a big club, when you win it's top and when you don't win it's terrible.\"",
      "Onana's colleagues haven't always been so warm. In May, during their Europa League final loss, he and midfielder Casemiro got into a heated argument after a cheap corner was given away early in the game. It was during the competition, too, that ex-Red Devil and former Lyon star Nemanja Matic dubbed Onana \"one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history.\"",
      "Regardless, Onana will now wave goodbye to Old Trafford for the time being, despite most of his team-mates consistently having his back. He is able to make such a move because the Turkish transfer window does not close until September 12, unlike the British market, which shut on September 1.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been told that his decision to avoid stepping up for a penalty until late in the shootout against Grimsby \"will be an issue within the dressing room\" as the Manchester United new boy continues to cop flack.",
      "The Slovenian was Ruben Amorim's most expensive signing of the summer and arrives with a huge reputation. Sesko is viewed as one of Europe's best young strikers but chose not to put his hand up in the Carabao Cup loss at the League Two side until late on.",
      "Sesko, who is yet to start a Premier League game or find the net, watched on as every outfield player stepped up. He eventually took the 10th penalty and converted from 12 yards, but much more was expected from a player signed for such a fee.",
      "Dietmar Hamann insists Sesko has to get off on the right foot, and allowing defenders to step up ahead of him will not help his standing within the dressing room - urging him against repeating the trick.",
      "He told CoinPoker: “Now, if you play a League Two side in the League Cup and it goes to a penalty shootout, and you cost £85million, you've got to take one of the first five penalties. You have to, because the players will look at you. The fans will look at you because it will be an issue within the dressing room, I can tell you that.",
      "“Because a centre-back or a full-back has to take a penalty and the star signing doesn't take one until the 10th penalty. This is what he has to be aware of because if you do one or two things like this early on in your career, the career might be finished at this club before it starts because you've got people against you. I think he has to be aware of it.",
      "“I don't know who advises him, I don't know who he listens to, but I think somebody should have a word with him and tell him about the dynamics within a team or a dressing room or a club like Manchester United, because he mustn't do this again. If he does, as I said, it could be over before it started.”",
      "It was later explained that Sesko, who played a full match for the first time in months, had been struggling with cramp and United were hoping to avoid using him until they had no other option. The Slovenian has continued to make do with cameos off the bench in the league.",
      "That has hindered his ability to find the net and he's still waiting to have a major impact for the struggling outfit. Eyebrows were raised when Joshua Zirkzee was bought on ahead of him in the win over Burnley, but Sesko insists he is progressing every day as he adapts to his new challenge.",
      "\"I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day,\" he said.",

      "Erik ten Hag may well claim that he won trophies during his haphazard Manchester United stint. He will do well though to claim he nailed his recruitment.",
      "The Dutchman had just over two years at the helm and was allowed to spend over £600million, but that couldn't make the Red Devils a title-fighting force once again. Instead, after a promising first year, he and his signings would only take the team backwards.",
      "It has left Ruben Amorim to inherit a squad that includes a number of players who haven't delivered on their big fees and are on hefty wages. The most damning reflection of Ten Hag's transfer business is that several of those he bought into the club are already being farmed out.",
      "Andre Onana is poised to be the next player who will be allowed to depart, albeit on loan. But a number of his team-mates have already been deemed surplus to requirements and moved on.",
      "Ten Hag pushed hard for several of their signings, Antony being a case in point. The Dutchman prepared to spend £81m to make the Brazilian his marquee signing when he first arrived. Two years on and he's already left for less than a third of his original fee.",
      "Amorim has spent the summer shelling out more than £200m on his frontline, adding the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo. That's despite fortunes already being spent on a squad that were among the lowest scorers in the Premier League last term.",
      "We take a look at all of Ten Hag's permanent signings and rank them - which paints a worrying picture for the state of United's recruitment.",
      "In his debut season the Argentine was able to prove a lot of the doubters wrong with his height cited as a major issue for him, especially in England. Technically impressive, Martinez would win the World Cup within months of making the move from Ajax, where he'd worked with Ten Hag. Injury has deprived him of consistent football but he's looked the most accomplished recent signing when given a decent run of games.",
      "Partly on what he could go on to achieve, and despite some difficult moments the French centre-half has largely looked pretty accomplished. He enjoyed a rapid rise in his homeland with Lille and earned plenty of plaudits. He's made himself a mainstay in the team and, with age of his side, looks as if he could blossom into an impressive defender.",
      "The fact Juventus and Bayern Munich moved him on was seen as a red flag and the Dutch defender by no means looked like the player we saw at Ajax years ago, but he has begun to settle. He, like Yoro, has landed himself a regular starting spot this year and is perhaps only this high because of the failures of those below him.",
      "Had this been done before the start of the season the ex-Chelsea man would be much lower, but he looks as if he may suit this Amorim system having been given plenty of opportunity to begin the season. Mount has excelled in a similar looking system with the Blues previously and his creative instincts could help him play a major role in the final third, which he'll need to given his price tag.",
      "Mazraoui followed De Ligt from Bayern and is yet another player in the squad to have played under Ten Hag before he brought him to Manchester. The Moroccan has done little to overly impress, but he's been handed some tough assignments, including being played as a 10 against Fenerbahce. However his relatively minimal fee means he is a loss the club can stomach.",
      "Kind of a familiar story, the full-back joined early in the Ten Hag-era and whilst he's not lit it up, he's not done much wrong. That's largely owing to an injury record that has seen him spend more time on the sideline than on the pitch. Malacia only set the club back just over £14m and, again, that is a loss that they can accept if the signing doesn't work out.",
      "The Uruguayan played under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon and it looked as if he may thrive once the Portuguese coach arrived, but that is not the case. His stats were impressive at PSG before he moved to United, but he's been unable to have the same impact. His aggressive style has not aided his ambitions and he's found himself more on the bench than on the pitch to start the campaign.",
      "He's started all three Premier League games so far this season but the Turk did make a major blunder that led to the loss on the opening weekend against Arsenal. Bayindir did enjoy his best moment when the Red Devils knocked the Gunners out of the FA Cup last year, but he's endured some embarrassing moments, including being beaten direct from a corner. However at just £4.3m, he was hardly expected to change the world.",
      "By all accounts Zirkzee was signed by ex-chief Dan Ashworth, not Ten Hag. His spell in Manchester is perhaps best remembered for the wrong reasons - the Dutchman being subbed off after 33 minutes in December with his own fans cheering his withdrawal. His promising season at Bologna saw United take note, but he managed just three league goals and is not seen as the answer in the final third.",
      "Some may point to the immediate positive impact he made after joining from Real Madrid in 2022. Yes he helped deliver the Carabao Cup, but his wages and long contract were always going to be an issue. Casemiro's performances have fallen off a cliff since his first year and United simply can't find a buyer. His pace has left him as he's aged and United's midfield only includes two midfielders, making the position all the more demanding for him.",
      "Now poised for a loan move to Trabzonspor where he'll double his wages, concern around the Cameroonian was evident when he somehow dodged a VAR check on his debut when a penalty should've been given. His performances were consistently error-strewn and he has not evolved United's game as Ten Hag hoped when he moved on David de Gea to sign his former Ajax goalkeeper. Amorim has dropped him in the past - and will now spend the year without him.",
      "Another signing where the red flags were evident from minute one. Yes Hojlund had impressed at Atalanta, but spending £74m to bring him to Manchester was always a risk. The signing was done with an acceptance that he would develop, but that has not been the case. He took months to score his first league goal and, at 22, leading the United line was always going to be a tough task. Already he's been loaned out.",
      "I don't think this needs much explaining. He remains the second most expensive United player in history and, bar a debut goal against Arsenal, had few positive moments in a red shirt. For that sort of money you have to deliver and he consistently underwhelmed. The environment clearly wasn't for him, because he has impressed in Spain, but his position among the biggest flops of all-time is probably justified.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Alcaraz, who left the final Grand Slam of the season as victor, has seized back his position as world No. 1, displacing the Italian at the summit of the rankings.",
      "The showpiece in New York City had been postponed following President Donald Trump's entrance at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, which necessitated heightened security protocols. Trump received a mixed reception of boos and applause during the national anthem when he appeared on the giant screen.",
      "The jeers then intensified until the broadcast switched away. The president didn't join in with the applause for Alcaraz pre-match and then appeared to fall asleep in a moment that was caught on camera.",
      "This marked the third Grand Slam of the season where Alcaraz and Sinner have faced off in the championship match - initially at Roland Garros, where Alcaraz prevailed in five sets. Sinner got his revenge with his own five-set spectacular triumph at Wimbledon in July.",
      "Rooney wasn't the sole Manchester-linked football legend closely monitoring the final. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, was present as a result of the September international break and was an attentive spectator of the clash in New York.",
      "Guardiola has previously expressed his admiration for tennis legends, claiming he drew inspiration for City's supremacy from the likes of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.",

      "However, when the Dutchman first met the Scouse WAG at a players' lunch, he made a jaw-dropping comment about Wayne's sperm - in an exchange no-one saw coming.",
      "Wayne, 39, has openly spoken about how Van Gaal was 'quite a loud and bubbly character' in the past, and during the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, he revealed the toe-curling quip the now 74-year-old made during his first-ever conversation with Coleen, 39.",

      "For Premier League sides, their time to secure major deals ended at 7pm on September 1, and we were certainly treated a frantic deadline day as the likes of Alexander Isak, Yoane Wissa and Randal Kolo Muani made their moves.",
      "There are still a few countries whose transfer windows haven't closed yet, including Turkey, Portugal and Saudi Arabia - meaning Premier League clubs could still sell or loan players to those countries.",
      "But when it comes to free agents, those players can arrive at any time regardless of the transfer window - and there are plenty still up for grabs. But with Premier League squads set to be confirmed this week, time is running out.",
      "The Danish star is yet to find a new club since leaving Manchester United on a free transfer at the end of last season and has been training with Swedish side Malmo to keep up his fitness levels.",
      "There had been speculation he could join Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham in the summer but a move never materialised and he remains without a new side, despite being able to hold discussions since the start of 2025.",
      "The former Tottenham playmaker was also linked with a move to newly-promoted Burnley, who still have time to add him to their ranks.",
      "Tomiyasu was a wanted man when he first joined Arsenal in 2021 but has struggled to find a suitor since his release from the Emirates this summer.",
      "The Japan international is still battling with a knee injury, which has understandably put off some clubs - who might want to wait until he's recovered.",
      "But reports claim AC Milan are weighing up an offer to Tomiyasu to join the club, although they want to assess his fitness condition first.",
      "The former Chelsea winger last played in Qatar for Al-Duhail, where he played 13 times in the second half of the 2024-25 season, before his contract was terminated by mutual consent.",
      "Before that, he had his contract scrapped at Galatasaray, having played 34 times for for the Turkish club across a season and a half.",
      "Considering his lack of success in Qatar, it might be difficult for Ziyech to drum up interest among top teams, but he is still 32 and could yet extend his career.",
      "English football fans will remember him for playing 107 times for Chelsea, scoring 14 times, though his time at Stamford Bridge ended in controversy after he was famously denied a move to PSG on deadline day.",
      "Once an exciting Real Madrid prodigy, Reguilon moved to Tottenham in 2020 but failed to fulfil his potential as a future world class left-back and quickly lost his place in the team, failing to impress a number of managers.",
      "He has since been on loan at Atletico Madrid, Manchester United and Brentford but was unable to pull up trees at any of those clubs.",
      "Despite starting his career with their bitter rivals, there have been reports that Atletico are eyeing up another move for Reguilon, with Diego Simeone's side needing depth after a winless start to the season.",
      "Reguilon is still only 28 and should have plenty of years ahead of him if he can get back on the right track in his career and play regularly.",
      "The former Arsenal and Liverpool man was released by Besiktas in the summer and is approaching a crossroads moment in his career aged 32.",
      "Oxlade-Chamberlain made 146 appearances for Liverpool between 2017 and 2023 and was initially a success in Turkey, playing a total of 30 times in his first season, before opportunities fizzled out.",
      "He only started 14 league games last season and was left out of their Europa League group stage squad. This summer, Besiktas opted to end his contract early, paying him a reported severance fee of £1.5m to do so.",
      "That hasn't stopped him being linked with a return to England, with Tom Brady's rising club Birmingham City linked with a move for the Three Lions international.",
      "The former Tottenham and England wonderkid is facing a really difficult moment in his career after being released by FC Como.",
      "His arrival in Italy last year was hoped as the start of a new chapter for the troubled star, who has been open about his struggles with addiction, mental health and a traumatic childhood.",
      "Como boss Cesc Fabregas reportedly banished Alli from his pre-season squad, having only played him once for the team - which saw him sent off in the first ten minutes last season.",
      "There has still been some interest from English teams, including Wrexham, Birmingham City and West Brom.",
      "A move to the Hawthorns would see him reunited with former Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason, who has just taken over as Baggies boss.",
      "Another quality player on the market is former Burnley midfielder Brownhill, who is still only 29 and should have plenty more to give after playing a huge part in the Clarets' promotion campaign.",
      "Brownhill scored a stunning 18 goals from 44 appearances in midfield, finishing as their top scorer as they finished second in the Championship and won promotion back to the Premier League.",
      "Despite discussing a new contract for Brownhill in May, it was announced in July that he was leaving on a free transfer.",
      "Brownhill, who has four seasons of Premier League experience, has been without a new club for a couple of months, but this week it emerged he was set for a move to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Shabab.",

      "The goalkeeper was linked with a summer exit but looked poised to remain at the club once the Premier League transfer window closed. However, Turkish clubs can still act and the Cameroon stopper will seal a season-long loan switch to the Super Lig outfit after agreeing to the move.",
      "Onana is due to travel to Turkey on Thursday to complete a deal, featuring a hefty pay rise owing to a big signing-on fee and bonuses. United will not bank a loan fee and Trabzonspor have no option to make the loan permanent, meaning he is due to return to Manchester at the end of the current campaign.",
      "The goalkeeper, like many of his team-mates, had to accept a 25 percent pay cut when the team missed out on the Champions League. United are now two years without playing in Europe's top competition and Onana's demand for a new deal was not well received by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Onana’s future at Old Trafford has been a talking point all summer, having not endeared himself to Amorim with his contract demand nor his fitness upon returning for pre-season - at a time with United pursing a new goalkeeper. On deadline they managed to completed the signing Senne Lammens from Antwerp in a £21.7million deal last week.",
      "Trabzonspor are in the process of selling their keeper, Ugurcan Cakir, to Galatasaray, which motivated them to pursue a loan deal for Onana has progressed quickly ahead of the transfer window closing in Turkey on Friday.",
      "United had maintained that the former Inter Milan goalkeeper, who was signed two years ago for £47m, was not for sale and would battle Lammens for the No.1 spot. However if he wanted to seek a move they would not stand in his way and Onana is now poised to land a lucrative contract for the remainder of the season.",
      "Onana's time in Manchester has been error-strewn and he's been overlooked for all three Premier League games thus far this term with Altay Bayindir preferred. The 29-year-old made another mistake during United’s humiliating Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby Town, albeit he was defended by Amorim.",
      "He said: “With all due respect, when you play against a fourth-division team, it’s not the goalkeeper, it’s everything. It’s the environment, it’s the way we face the competition. We know that we are in the moment everything people will pay attention to everything. It’s going to be massive every detail.\"",

      "Yeray Alvarez has been suspended until April 2026 after failing a doping test following Athletic Bilbao's 3-0 loss to Manchester United in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final back in May.",
      "Alvarez, 30, played the full game as Bilbao were soundly beaten at home by United, who advanced to the final with a 7-1 aggregate win after beating the La Liga outfit again at Old Trafford the following week.",
      "UEFA confirmed in a statement on Monday morning that Alvarez would be suspended from competition for 10 months, though he is able to return to training in early February 2026. The statement read: \"On 1 May 2025, Athletic Club player Yeray Alvarez underwent an in-competition doping control carried out by UEFA following a UEFA Europa League match.",
      "\"The analysis of the player’s sample by a WADA-accredited laboratory revealed the presence of Canrenone, which is a substance prohibited in- and out- of competition under the category S5. Diuretics and Masking Agents of the 2025 WADA Prohibited List.",

      "Alvarez addressed the test in a social media post back in July where he said that the adverse findings were from a treatment for alopecia. \"After studying the case, we have established that I tested positive because I unintentionally took a hair loss prevention medicine containing a banned substance,\" the defender said.",
      "\"The disciplinary procedure is currently under investigation and subject to confidentiality so I am provisionally suspended and am not authorised to make any further public statements.",

      "It was supposed to be a signing that would revolutionise Manchester United. But a little over two years on from Andre Onana's arrival at Old Trafford, the Cameroon star is being ushered out the back door on loan.",
      "Onana, 29, was signed at the peak of his powers after starring in Inter Milan's run to the Champions League final, where they eventually succumbed to United's bitter rivals, Manchester City. On paper, it looked a shrewd move: Onana was as proficient with his feet as he was with his hands and rated as one of Europe's best 'keepers. Unfortunately for United, football isn't played on paper and Onana has failed to live up to the lofty reputation he arrived with and, as a result, is now poised to join Trabzonspor in an underwhelming loan move.",
      "Nobody is disputing United's decision to move on from Onana, who has been consistently inconsistent since succeeding David de Gea in the Old Trafford goal. But the reality of doing so - and what comes next - now comes into focus.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not select Onana for any of United's three league fixtures so far this season, with Altay Bayindir deputising. Senne Lammens, the promising young Belgium keeper, was signed in the final hours of the summer transfer window and will now compete for game time with Bayindir; but who will get the nod as United's No 1?",
      "As much as it was stressed that Lammens' arrival was not a surefire sign that Onana was on his way, the £18.2million deal to acquire the 23-year-old - who is widely regarded in Belgium as Thibaut Courtois' heir - effectively put Onana in no man's land.",
      "The Turkey international is already being targeted by rivals for his inability to cope with set-pieces, which was exposed in the 1-0 loss to Arsenal in United's season opener. And while few - if any - would argue with Amorim's decision to axe Onana for Bayindir following the former's erratic displays in a Manchester United shirt, Bayindir has shown nothing to suggest he can relied upon as a dependable deputy in between the sticks.",
      "All that means that Lammens is likely to be thrown in at the deep end; quite literally when you consider than United's next fixture is the Manchester derby.",
      "In many ways, Onana never recovered from a shaky start to his Old Trafford tenure; he issued an apology just weeks after joining the club after failing to cover himself in glory in the 4-3 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. United will want to give Lammens, who they view as a player capable of growing into the No 1 role and becoming a mainstay for years to come, every chance of success. Whether that pathway involves a watching brief to begin with remains to be seen.",
      "If anyone knows the score right now when it comes to the goalkeeper situation, it's Amorim. \"It is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment,\" he said after watching another erratic performance from Bayindir in the 3-2 win over Burnley prior to the international break.",
      "He's even been told that he can’t play Bayindir again following his poor start to the season to by the former Chelsea midfielder, Craig Burley. But Onana's departure means he Amorim and United will have to throw their faith behind their No 2 and effectively make him their stand-in No 1, or throw Lemmens in at the deep end and hope he swims.",
      "Neither option feels ideal given United are coming off their worst ever campaign in the Premier League era - even if choosing to axe Onana now is absolutely the right thing to do.",

      "One of the biggest nights in Grimsby Town’s history was plunged into doubt after they fielded an ineligible player. Grimsby took on Premier League giants Manchester United at home in the Carabao Cup second round last month.",
      "To the astonishment of all watching, the Mariners secured a 12-11 win on penalties over Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils, having lost their 2-0 lead late in the second half. A pitch invasion and scenes of utter delight ensued - but the League Two side later admitted a huge blunder in playing Clarke Oduor, a new signing who had not been registered in time.",
      "Grimsby reported their own mistake, saying it had been an administrative error. Despite Oduor actually missing his penalty in the shootout, there were calls for the minnows to be expelled from the tournament, or for a replay to at least take place.",
      "However, neither of those will be considered, with the club instead being fined £20,000 by the EFL. They may consider themselves lucky, as we now take a look at rare instances in the past where matches have in fact been replayed in controversial circumstances.",
      "In August 2013, Charlton’s clash with Doncaster at The Valley was controversially called off at half-time because of a waterlogged pitch, despite Rovers leading 3-1. The heavy rainfall made conditions tough from kick-off and referee Lee Collins initially suspended play after 26 minutes.",
      "They did resume but Collins then deemed the conditions unsafe at the break, with Doncaster boss Paul Dickov calling the manner in which the game was abandoned “shambolic.” To add further insult to injury, the rematch in November began with the score at 0-0, with Charlton going on to win that game 2-0, much to the annoyance of Dickov as his side slipped to 20th in the table.",
      "In February 1999, Sheffield United took on Arsenal in the fifth round of the FA Cup at Highbury and, with the game poised at 1-1 following Patrick Vieira’s goal and Marcelo’s equaliser for the Blades, the game descended into chaos. United goalkeeper Alan Kelly kicked the ball out of play for a throw-in to allow injured team-mate Lee Morris to receive treatment.",
      "The away side thought Arsenal would return the ball to them following the restart, which is what Ray Parlour intended to do, but debutant Nwankwo Kanu had other plans. The Nigerian striker intercepted the pass back to the Blades and set up Marc Overmars to take the lead.",
      "It sparked outrage among Steve Bruce’s side, who ordered his players to walk off the pitch in protest. The Gunners saw out a win but the injustice raged on and manager Arsene Wenger offered United a rematch, which they accepted. Arsenal won the repeated fixture courtesy of goals from Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp.",
      "On November 10, 2017, Senegal became the third African nation to qualify for the 2018 World Cup by beating South Africa 2-0, eliminating Bafana Bafana. The game, however, was merely a replay of the original November 2016 fixture that had been won 2-1 by South Africa.",
      "That result was later chalked off by FIFA after Ghana referee Joseph Lamptey was found guilty of manipulating the result. Lamptey had awarded a penalty for a non-existent handball against Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, with replays showing that the ball had actually struck his knee.",
      "South Africa scored the penalty and went on to win the qualifier - their only win in the final round of qualifiers at that point. FIFA found Lamptey guilty of breaching the rule relating to “unlawfully influencing match results.”",
      "The governing body also concluded that Lamptey was at fault for South Africa's second goal just two minutes later, stating that the Ghanaian \"clearly took two wrong decisions, which led to two goals being scored by South Africa.\"",
      "They added: \"He [took] intentional decisions with the sole purpose of facilitating a minimum number of goals to make certain bets successful.\" He was banned for life as a result.",

But rather than head straight home to revel in his exploits, the South American used his own time to put in extra work following the final whistle.",
      "The Daily Mail reported at the time that Garnacho visited the NAS Elite Sports Performance Centre in Manchester following the Fulham win. The clinic is a favourite for other Premier League stars and offers physiotherapy, osteopathy, strength and conditioning, nutritional support and other services, including phlebotomy, IV drip therapy and vitamin shots.",
      "Former United team-mates Kobbie Mainoo, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Sofyan Amrabat are among the centre's past clientele. Former Chelsea full-back Ian Maatsen has also used its services, while Blues defender Tosin Adarabioyo has also been a patron in the past.",
      "And it may impress Maresca to know his new recruit is willing to put that kind of work in to get the most out of his career. While others would be content to celebrate in the wake of a Week 1 win, Garnacho's priority was to ensure he had an optimal recovery post-game.",
      "The prospect may have felt some frustration with his performance at home to Fulham last year given he missed an open goal in the game. That came prior to him teeing up Zirkzee for the decider and perhaps played on his mind despite having a key role in the result.",
      "That's precisely the side of Garnacho's character his new boss will be hoping to nurture in west London. And the early signs are that the winger is going to war in his efforts to make an early impression under Maresca.",
      "Following his first training session as a Chelsea player, Garnacho's comments indicated just how hard he was working to stand out. \"Can't move my legs now man,\" he told a member of Chelsea's media team. \"I sprinted in the last one.\"",
      "Lionel Scaloni didn't select Garnacho in his latest Argentina squad, meaning he has had extra time to train with his new team over the international break. Maresca's men return to action on Saturday when they'll make the short trip to Brentford for a west London derby.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is set to join Trabzonspor on loan. While Premier League clubs are not allowed to sign new players until the new year, the Turkish transfer window is one of a handful to remain open a little longer this month.",
      "Onana moved to Old Trafford from Inter Milan in 2023 and spent the last two seasons as first choice. He was left out by Ruben Amorim at the start of the campaign, though, with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",
      "United added Senne Lammens to their ranks on Monday, paying a little over £18million for the young Belgian. The move appears to have accelerated Onana's departure, though the move is a straightforward loan with no buy option included.",
      "According to The Athletic, the Cameroon international's United wages will be covered by the Turkish club. He is also entitled to bonuses which could see him double his current earnings.",
      "Onana is due to complete his move after playing for Cameroon against Cape Verde. Victory would see the Indomitable Lions move to the top of their World Cup qualifying group, with all group winners progressing to next summer's tournament and the four best runners-up getting a second chance via the play-offs.",
      "Former Chelsea and Scotland star Craig Burley questioned Onana's progress since his arrival at Old Trafford. \"[He's] another player who’s gone to Manchester United and got worse. He cost a lot of money but he wasn’t able to marshal a back four,\" Burley told ESPN.",
      "\"I thought Onana would be the real deal, it looked that way in Italy. I thought he might have a Peter Schmeichel-esque aura about him and boss about players but it hasn’t happened. If this new, youngish lad comes in and starts flapping about all over the place, it’s going to be a mess.\"",
      "Lammens, 23, has outlined how he wants to earn the backing of the defenders in front of him. “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” he told club media.",
      "“They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",

      "Andre Onana is said to be open to the idea of leaving Manchester United for Turkey - but has yet to make a final decision on a move to Trabzonspor. The former Inter Milan man has endured a rollercoaster couple of seasons at Old Trafford since arriving for £43m.",
      "High-profile errors have blighted his performances, while Onana has found himself behind Altay Bayindir this season. The Cameroonian then fell even further down the pecking order with the £18m arrival of Senne Lammens on deadline day. United have been open to letting Onana leave all summer, albeit he did not manage to find a new club before the end of the Premier League window. Since then, Turkish side Trabzonspor have opened talks with United regarding a loan move.",
      "According to The Athletic, the move would be a straight loan with a buy option. Trabzonspor now need Onana’s approval to complete a move and while he is open to a switch, he still wants to review the contract on offer.",
      "The Turkish window remains open until September 12, with Trabzonspor keen to get a deal secured ahead of their next game against Fenerbahce, which takes place two days later. Onana still has three years left on the long-term contract he signed when he moved to Old Trafford back in the summer of 2023.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim recently leapt to Onana’s defence after a poor performance against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. He said: \"They are humans. At Manchester United, everything is analysed. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper and these situations keep happening. We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper.\"",
      "Elsewhere, United’s summer addition Lammens has already made a number of promises should he be installed as the Red Devil’s number one following his arrival from Royal Antwerp. “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” said Lammens. “They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",

Onana now looks likely to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on a season-long loan with Bayindir starting their first three games in the Premier League.",
      "The club are open to letting Onana go after signing promising goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in the final hours of the summer transfer window for around £18m, with the young Belgian expected to go on and establish himself as the club's first choice shot-stopper.",
      "And Burley is adamant that playing Bayindir is no longer an option for Amorim after watching the keeper' fail to convince in his outings so far this term, where he has been exposed from set-pieces in particular. \"Altay Bayindir, they can’t play him,\" Burley told ESPN. \"He might be okay at shot-stopping, which is what goalkeepers are paid for, but he’s absolutely useless at dealing with balls in from set-pieces.",

I thought Onana would be the real deal, it looked that way in Italy. I thought he might have a Peter Schmeichel-esque aura about him and boss about players but it hasn’t happened. If this new, youngish lad comes in and starts flapping about all over the place, it’s going to be a mess.\"",
      "While Lammens has been backed to be the new United No 1, former Red Devils shot-stopper Ben Foster believes the signing is a \"panic buy\" and said the club needed someone \"with broad shoulders\" in between the sticks.",
      "He said: \"I’ve watched a lot of videos of him [Lammens] on YouTube … and he looks on the eye test like he’s a competent goalkeeper. I’m yet to see what he’s like with the ball at his feet though and I think he’s a panic buy.",
      "\"United have probably always got some sort of list of goalkeepers that they look at and they keep tabs on. There will be scouts all over the world …but I don’t think they’ve done an in-depth analysis. A deadline day goalkeeper signing tells me that your club is desperate.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has given Manchester United a timely fitness boost after sharing a positive update on his injury. Cunha was forced off during United’s 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break, sparking fears he could be set for a spell on the sidelines.",
      "The £62.5million summer signing from Wolves went down in the first half of the Premier League game clutching his right hamstring. Both he and Mason Mount picked up injuries in the match, which took the shine off United’s first league win of the season.",
      "Cunha was forced to pull out of Brazil's squad for their World Cup qualifiers in the international break. He reassured fans by saying that he'll be 'back soon', though, and there was more good news on the Brazilian’s Instagram account.",
      "Posting a photo of himself on an exercise bike in the gym, Cunha wrote: \"The time is flying,\" alongside a clock emoji and dynamite emoji. He then shared another photo of him posing with a UFC wristband saying: ‘obrigado pela moral’, which translates to ‘thanks for the moral’.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be desperate to have Cunha available for their trip to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. United have picked up where they left off last season, struggling for creativity, despite spending over £200m on new forwards. They opened the campaign with a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal before a 1-1 draw against Fulham and an embarrassing defeat by Grimsby on penalties. The win over Burnley came via a late penalty and Amorim expressed his worries post-match.",
      "\"It was hard to lose Cunha and Mason Mount, because Mason Mount played 30 minutes with an injury,\" he said. \"I'm concerned about that, because they are so important for us. We will see.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't know [how are they], I don't know. We will check them. We need those guys really bad to be really competitive.\"",
      "Amorim will get a clearer picture of Cunha’s fitness levels in the coming days before he decides on his squad and line-up for the Manchester Derby. While Cunha is yet to get off the mark in a United shirt, his fellow new forward Bryan Mbeumo has now netted in back-to-back matches. The £71m signing from Brentford scored in the defeat by Grimsby before finding the net against in the win over Burnley.",
      "“Every game is hard and important. We had the game with us in the first half, but we had to fight every minute,” Amorim told BBC Match of the Day. “I'm very happy, and we win as well – as a striker, it is important to be confident with goals.”",

The Manchester United forward got a fresh start this summer when he clinched a dream loan to Barcelona after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Rashford has endured a poor start to life in Catalonia. The 27-year-old has started just one out of the club’s opening three league games, while he was taken off at half-time during last month’s win against Levante. He is yet to contribute to a goal and that has led to suggestions in Spain that Barcelona could attempt to cancel the loan agreement for the forward early.",
      "He was unable to make the most of an opportunity to open his account for the season as England stumbled to an underwhelming 2-0 win over Andorra on Saturday, with Tuchel keeping faith in the forward since taking the helm as the Three Lions boss.",
      "However, even the German admits that Rashford has struggled to live up to his potential in an England shirt. \"He struggles a bit with numbers and with the ‘wow’ performance in an England shirt, I agree,” Tuchel said post-match.",
      "“But as long as he trains like he did and behaves and is active and alive in the group, then we will always trust him and push him and support him. I can see that he tries, this is for me the most important that he stays positive and he trains at the moment with the right attitude, with a smile and with a lot of quality.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Rashford has already given his verdict on his slow start to life with Barcelona, and admitted that he was still off the pace when it came to the fitness. He said: “The intensity here is very high.",
      "“Preseason has been tough; I finished exhausted after every session. It’s not just about running—it’s about working with the ball and keeping a constant level. That’s what really takes the most effort.”",

      "Manchester United responded positively to Harry Maguire's transfer summons after the defender called for renovations in the summer. The 32-year-old predicted there would be \"a lot of changes\" taking place during the transfer window and was proved right after Ruben Amorim transformed the make-up of his squad.",
      "United revolutionised their attack with the additions of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for a combined investment of around £200million. Sesko, 22, was later to arrive at Old Trafford, but it would be fair to consider all three players part of Amorim's new starting XI.",
      "The same might be said for goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who was signed from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. The Belgian is yet to make his debut between the posts for United but should be the new No. 1 given the concerns that have surrounded incumbent keepers Andre Onana, who has reportedly agreed a loan move to Trabzonspor, and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Perhaps even more pertinent are United's departures, however, with no fewer than 12 players leaving the club either permanently or on loan. Wingers Antony and Alejandro Garnacho left on permanent transfers, while Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund have each departed on temporary deals.",
      "The Red Devils have been slow out of the gates this season, but Amorim can't say he hasn't been handed the means to make his own imprint on the team. And Maguire has also got his way after urging the club to take action over the summer months.",
      "\"We will make a lot of changes in the summer at the club,\" said the England international in May. \"There will be a lot of players who leave and hopefully a lot of players will come in.",
      "\"And that’s down to the club to make sure they get that right, and it’s down to us players to make sure that we are the ones that are involved.\"",
      "United were anticipated to struggle for funds this summer after finishing 15th in the Premier League last term. That, coupled with their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, saw them fail to qualify for any European competition for the first time in a decade.",
      "Yet a net spend of around £160m proved the coffers were hardly empty. Not to mention co-owners Ineos showed their commitment to Amorim's project by backing the boss in the transfer market.",
      "Maguire, meanwhile, has found himself out of Amorim's XI at the start of this season after managing just two Premier League appearances off the bench thus far. Amorim has preferred a centre-back trio of Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw and Matthijs de Ligt, while Lisandro Martinez is still recovering from the serious knee injury he suffered in February.",
      "Such widespread changes will require time to take effect at Old Trafford, time United don't have as they look to regain their former glories. But Maguire nor the fans can complain the club hasn't taken action in its efforts to get back on top.",

      "Manchester United paused for the September international break on the back of a much-needed first victory of the season.",
      "The dramatic 3-2 success against Burnley alleviated some of the pressure that had been building following a defeat to Arsenal, a draw at Fulham and a woeful cup exit at the hands of fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "United are ninth in the league on four points - ahead of Manchester City as the two teams prepare to face off in the Manchester derby this week.",
      "And while Ruben Amorim will have been mightily relieved to see his side snatch three points against the Clarets late on, he will know that much more is required if United are to challenge for a place in the top six come the end of the season. Here are three issues Amorim must address in the coming weeks.",
      "It feels like the United midfield has been in need of a sort-out for much of the past decade.",
      "Amorim has pushed Bruno Fernandes back into the middle since the arrival of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but the skipper is not a natural for the number eight role in terms of defensive awareness and positioning.",
      "That has seen a return for veteran Casemiro alongside him, with the Brazil international's nous and experience seeing him earn a spot in the side at the expense of the seemingly unfancied Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The latter was supposed to be the great solution in the middle, but you can't say with any certainty that he, Mainoo and Casemiro will be at Old Trafford next season.",
      "A central midfielder will be the next transfer priority, but in the short term, Amorim has to find a combination that can provide the steel and athleticism needed.",
      "United have more senior goalkeeper options than they do central midfielders, with the arrival of Senne Lammens taking the tally to four.",
      "That might be reduced by one should Andre Onana depart for Trabzonspor on loan, with the 29-year-old reportedly weighing up an offer.",
      "Altay Bayindir has held the gloves in the Premier League thus far but failed to convince, while Tom Heaton, soon to be 40, seems destined to be third choice regardless in whichever combination of keepers remains.",
      "Lammens may well emerge as No. 1, but it would be a big ask to throw the 23-year-old in for a debut in the Manchester derby regardless of Bayindir's shortcomings.",
      "But United need consistency and to pick a horse and back it. Lammens might just be the best bet.",
      "Amorim has been ruthless with his squad - he's jettisoned Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, among others, and Onana could follow the 'bomb squad' in departing the club this summer.",
      "Now the United boss will want his players to be ruthless in the final third. United have scored four goals in three games - and missed a penalty - but half that tally came through own goals and one via Bruno Fernandes' last-gasp match-winning spot kick against Burnley. Mbuemo's goal in the same game is the only open play strike United have netted in the league.",
      "While that paints a negative picture, the underlying numbers are positive. United could and should have been out of sight against Burnley after a dominant first half, while they spurned chances against both Fulham and Arsenal.",
      "Indeed, if the table was ranked by expected goals, United would be top with 6.78, while they have also taken more shots than any other side in the Premier League and had more touches in the opposition box with 42 and 99, respectively.",
      "This suggests United are attacking with intent and purpose but failing to convert chances. Amorim will hope Cunha's injury is not too serious while believing Mbeumo can build on his goal at Burnley and that Benjamin Sesko can find his feet following his arrival.",

      "And while Premier League clubs are not able to get any more new faces through the door after the window shut earlier this week, there remain opportunities to sell any unwanted stars to clubs whose domestic windows remain open. And United could capitalise on the chance to do just that.",
      "The window in Turkey remains open until September 12, with Andre Onana linked with a loan switch to Trabzonspor, with the 29-year-old reportedly weighing up the switch.",

      "Meanwhile, unwanted defender Tyrell Malacia remains at Old Trafford after his loan move to Spanish side Elche collapsed late in the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is another who could seal a United exit in the coming days, with a switch to Turkey a possibility.",

      "The goalkeeper has not featured in United's opening three Premier League games, with Altay Bayindir preferred, while the deadline day arrival of Senne Lammens adds another level of competition.",
      "Onana, who cost United £43.9million when he arrived from Inter Milan in 2023, is reportedly weighing up a move to Trabzonspor.",
      "The transfer window in Turkey is open until September 12, while Onana, who has three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, is currently on international duty with Cameroon.",
      "Trabzonspor are currently second in the Turkish Super Lig after an unbeaten start to the campaign and face Fenerbahce in their next match on September 14.",
      "That could, in theory, be Onana's debut for the club if a move was agreed, and it would be his first league outing since United's defeat to Chelsea in mid May.",
      "Amorim has overlooked Onana in the top flight this season despite the keeper, who missed pre-season with an injury, returning to full fitness.",
      "Baynidir started the season opener at Arsenal, with Amorim saying: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life.",
      "\"This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he's recovered, but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "But next week was not different, with Bayindir preferred.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay. Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked after the question was posed in the wake of the defeat to Arsenal.",
      "\"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.\"",
      "Onana was given the gloves for the EFL Cup tie at League Two Grimsby but was at fault for at least one of the two goals scored by the Mariners as they completed a seismic shock and knocked United out on penalties after a 2-2 draw.",
      "Speaking about Onana after the defeat, Amorim said: \"It's not about the goalkeeper. It's not about the goalkeeper.",
      "\"With all due respect, against a fourth division side, we have to block everything about the opponent. Andre should touch the ball with his feet if we are in the high level.\"",
      "After Bayindir was at fault for one of Burnley's goals in United's 3-2 victory in the game following the Grimsby debacle, Amorim used his post match press conference to make a more general point about the pressures of playing in goal for the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United, everything is analysed. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper,\" he said.",
      "\"And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper and these situations keep happening. We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper.\"",

To some extent, it did, with Ruben Amorim's side deserved winners overall, even if they needed a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes to earn all three points.",
      "Yet no one can be convinced by the chaotic nature of another 90 minutes at Old Trafford - particularly with it coming against a team who are favourites to be relegated. A more impressive statement can be made on Sunday afternoon at Pep Guardiola's faltering team.",
      "While City have lost two of their opening three fixtures and are, much to the amazement of some, below crisis-hit United in the table - they still hold an aura from their recent dominance under Guardiola. Beating them still means a great deal - especially for United.",
      "The Reds enjoyed arguably their greatest day under Amorim when Amad played a key role in United's 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium last season. But United's head coach now faces a conundrum with that very player who secured an improbable victory in the dying moments of that fixture in December 2024.",

      "Eriksen has been without a club since leaving United at the end of his contract in the summer. Him being a free agent means that he can join a new club, despite the summer transfer window now being closed.",
      "The Danish international has been linked with moves to several clubs over the past couple of months. He was in talks with Championship side Wrexham - but is reported to have turned down the opportunity to join the Welsh club.",
      "Eriksen has been maintaining his fitness by training with Swedish side Malmo. Being without a club means that he was left out of Denmark's latest squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Scotland and Greece over the current international break.",
      "The 33-year-old will be on the lookout for the right opportunity when it comes around, and a change at German club Bayer Leverkusen could potentially give him that opportunity.",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag was dismissed as manager of the club at the start of the month, with Leverkusen now announcing the appointment of Hjulmand as his replacement. The 53-year-old is most known for taking charge of Denmark and leading them to the European Championship semi-final in 2021, where they lost to England.",
      "Eriksen was part of that Denmark squad, but he missed the rest of the tournament after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first game against Finland. After fully recovering, he made his comeback in 2022 and continued to be a regular for his nation.",
      "Having worked closely with each other in the past on the international stage, Hjulmund could potentially turn to Eriksen as he looks to put his stamp on his new side. Leverkusen may also be on the lookout for additional quality in attacking midfield following the £116million summer sale of Florian Wirtz to Liverpool.",

      "With options in attacking midfield already in place, should he join Leverkusen, Eriksen may find regular starts hard to come by. To be guaranteed regular game-time, the midfielder may have to drop down a level and it's a decision that will have to be made by Eriksen himself.",

      "Manchester United ended up having a rather busy finale to the summer transfer window. And, in truth, there was the potential for it to have been even more hectic than it ended up.",
      "Five new signings were completed by United this summer, with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens joining Diego Leon in moving to Old Trafford. The transfer window saw United address their forward line and their goalkeeping department - but one area of their squad still, arguably, needs to be addressed.",
      "United were linked with several midfielders during the summer, with Brighton star Carlos Baleba one name that was mentioned as a potential target. However, it would likely have taken a fee in excess of £100million to give a deal a chance of getting agreed, something which United were not willing to do this summer.",
      "Only time will tell if United will still have an interest in Baleba in the months ahead, particularly in January which is notoriously a difficult time to do business. Brighton will likely not want to sell Baleba midway through a season - so United may be forced to look at alternative targets if they still wish to sign a midfielder.",
      "One player who could be viewed as an alternative to Baleba is Angelo Stiller. The Stuttgart midfielder was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League during the summer - but ended up remaining with the Bundesliga outfit.",
      "Sport Bild even reported on deadline day that United had expressed an interest in signing Stiller, who is reported to be valued at around €60million (£52million). Whether the interest in Stiller is genuine remains to be seen, but if United are unable to sign Baleba, then the Stuttgart star could be a midfield alternative worth considering.",

      "Last month, a Manchester United staff member touched on the future of Rhys Bennett.",
      "\"Rhys has his sights set high,\" they said. That comment was perceived as Bennett wanting a loan in the Championship, but perhaps it was alluding to the youngster's ambition to break into the senior squad.",
      "In the final days of the transfer window, United sources said Bennett could still go out on loan, which seemed the most logical option for the defender after his Fleetwood Town stint.",
      "However, it became clear in the final hours of deadline day that Bennett was unlikely to leave.",
      "That leaves the 21-year-old in an interesting situation because he has clearly outgrown academy football. Bennett will only gain match fitness from playing for the Under-21s in the first half of the campaign.",
      "Could Bennett contribute to the first-team squad? With the benefit of hindsight, maybe that is what the United staff member meant, so don't be surprised to see him in training at Carrington.",
      "Bennett has not made his first-team debut for United, although he could sense an opportunity after Tyler Fredricson was involved. Fredricson was named on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, and he started against Grimsby Town before being hooked at half-time in the Carabao Cup debacle.",
      "Fredricson made two senior appearances last season. Bennett is slightly older, more experienced after his Fleetwood loan and may fancy his chances of usurping his fellow academy graduate in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "No player emerged with credit from the Grimsby performance, but it was a particularly tough evening for Fredricson, who received an earful from Amorim throughout the first half.",
      "Fredricson has always had a strong reputation in academy circles. Bennett is also highly regarded and captained the Under-18s to FA Youth Cup success at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore starred in that supremely talented young team, but Bennett was the captain and opened the scoring in the final against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In the last three years, Bennett has watched Mainoo, Garnacho, Gore and Charlie McNeill make their senior United debuts. He shared the dressing room with those players during the FA Youth Cup run, but he's been forced to bide his time and work hard to get a sniff of a potential opening.",
      "Has that opening finally emerged? The Denton-born lad has the next six months to achieve what he dreamt about as a kid: a debut for United. The time is now for him to push toward making it a reality.",
      "It won't be easy for Bennett, but he must back himself to progress after watching Fredricson receive minutes. They play in the same position and Bennett will think he can achieve what Fredricson has.",
      "Bennett should be hardened from his Fleetwood loan last season. The centre-back made 38 appearances across all competitions and gained crucial experience of fighting for points each week.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios,\" said Bennett last season about playing competitive football with Fleetwood.",
      "“When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.”",
      "The elephant in the room is that Bennett is unlikely to feature prominently. Amorim has Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven and Noussair Mazraoui as options for the back-three.",
      "Lisandro Martinez will also return from the sidelines in the coming weeks. However, injuries could completely change the state of play and Bennett will be ready if an opportunity arises.",

      "Kone was taken to hospital and the fixture was abandoned with no replacement ambulance available. The midfielder stayed in hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning to recover at home.",
      "Neither side had scored at the time of the abandonment. It's understood the fixture has been difficult to rearrange due to conflicting schedules, but an agreement has been reached to meet again on Tuesday, December 16.",
      "The new date means United's opening group-stage game in the National League Cup will now be against Brackley on Tuesday, September 16.",
      "Shortly after the fixture was abandoned, United released a statement saying: \"Manchester United's game at Tamworth was abandoned close to the end of the first half.",
      "\"The tie was halted due to a head injury suffered by Reds midfielder Sekou Kone, inside his own box, and the youngster was taken off on a stretcher.",
      "\"We can confirm Sekou is conscious, stable and communicating with United’s medical team. He has been taken to hospital, as a precaution, for further checks.",
      "\"Everybody at the club wishes him a speedy recovery.\"",
      "Kone was making his first competitive appearance of the season against Tamworth. Ruben Amorim named Kone in the USA pre-season tour squad this summer, but the youngster didn't make an appearance.",
      "Amorim named Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last season - against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - but the youngster is still waiting to make his senior debut.",

      "The Reds have started the season with a mixed bag of results. United's Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town was undoubtedly the low point of the opening fixtures, but there have been signs of encouragement following the victory over Burnley and even in the defeat to Arsenal.",
      "When the Premier League returns a week on Sunday for United, all eyes will be on Ruben Amorim as they travel to Manchester City for the derby. A replica of the result from last season will do the Portuguese head coach wonders, but if he is to do that, he may have to do it without some of his key players.",
      "One star who is a huge concern for the game against City is Lisandro Martinez. The Argentine has been sidelined since February with injury, and while he is back on the grass at Carrington, it is unlikely that he will be able to come straight back into the starting line-up.",
      "Martinez, should he return against Pep Guardiola's team, will likely have to settle for a place among the substitutes. As for his defensive partner Diogo Dalot, he has become a fresh concern for United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The full-back has withdrawn from the Portugal squad recently due to a 'muscle discomfort'. United will be hoping this is merely a precautionary measure but could call upon Patrick Dorgu to fill in on the left were he to be out of the derby.",
      "Mason Mount hobbled off against City the last time United travelled to the Etihad Stadium and he could miss the side that faces them this time around after playing '30 minutes' with an injury against Burnley. His issue does not appear to be too serious and the hope is that he can at least make the bench.",
      "Finally, United will be holding their breath on Matheus Cunha. Despite having not scored for the club yet, the Brazilian has been a near-constant threat for the Reds, so it was a concern when he looked to have picked up a hamstring issue against the Clarets.",
      "Cunha has since taken to Instagram to suggest that he will be 'back soon'. However, it is unclear whether this means his return shall be swift for the City fixture or not.",

      "Tottenham is the current UK home of the NFL with matches staged at their stadium, although NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson this week sounded open to the idea that the new United stadium could also host games. In the meantime, as the Ravens look to extend their fanbase their Offensive Tackle is hoping to feel some of the intensity from fans in Manchester.",
      "“I’ve had some friends on the team that I am a fan of, but overall, I have a lot of respect for the team,\" Stanley said. \"I am definitely a Rashford fan, that’s my guy. I wouldn’t say I am just a United fan though, I don’t get to follow them enough to call myself that, but whenever I get the chance, I’ll get them on the TV.

Although signing a new midfielder was also on the agenda - with Carlos Baleba under consideration - Brighton & Hove Albion's valuation of over £100million forced the club to potentially put that approach on hold until next summer.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has already delivered exactly what he was brought to Manchester United to do: score goals.",
      "The 26-year-old, who joined from Brentford in the summer for a deal that could rise to £71million, has scored in each of his last two games for United.",
      "Having scored 20 Premier League goals for the Bees last season, Mbeumo was brought in, alongside Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, to cure United's goalscoring woes from last term.",
      "So far, so good, for the Cameroon international.",
      "Starting on the right hand side of United's front three, Mbeumo has improved the team's pressing from the front and found the back of the net against Grimsby and Burnley.",
      "Ahead of next Sunday's Manchester derby, the former Troyes forward is arguably United's biggest goalscoring threat they will bring to the Etihad.",
      "As well as scoring goals, though, Mbeumo's assist record at Brentford was equally as good.",
      "Last season he registered nine assists in all competitions following on from seven in both 2023/24 and 2021/22, eight in 2022/23 and 12 in 2020/21 - the season Brentford were promoted to the Premier League.",
      "While he is yet to register an assist for United, he was at his creative best for Cameroon on Thursday as he helped the Indomitable Lions beat Eswatini 3-0 in their World Cup qualifier in Yaounde.",
      "Mbeumo created both of Cameroon's first two goals. The first was an excellent inswinging cross from the right-hand side which forced Eswatini defender Gift Gamedze to divert the ball into his own net.",
      "The second assist was almost identical, although this time his inswinging delivery was met by the head of Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to double their lead.",
      "The win left Cameroon one point adrift of group leaders Cape Verde with three matches remaining in the race to qualify for next year's World Cup.",
      "Yes, 155th world ranked nation Eswatini isn't an indicator of the level of opposition Mbeumo will come up against in the Premier League but it serves as a reminder of what else he will bring to United other than goals.",
      "Ahead of the Manchester derby, United will be hopeful he can be at his creative best when they make the short trip across the city to face their local rivals next weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand was “flattened” when told ahead of the visit of Burnley to Old Trafford that Leny Yoro hadn’t started a Premier League game in which Manchester United have defeated a current Premier League side.",
      "“What am I hearing?” Ferdinand said. “I’m trying to have a good, positive moment here, trying to get some positivity.",
      "“But that is testament – if I can find a positive angle on this – that is testament to his resilience, you know. You know how difficult it is to play football, not winning, but still putting out performances that are improving week in week out? That’s a big thing that, you know.”",
      "That is an extremely acute positive angle to have found, but having come through an incredibly challenging debut season largely unscathed, Yoro is showing that Ferdinand’s burgeoning “love” of him as a footballer is well founded in his second campaign. He really does look the part.",
      "And credit where it’s due, Ferdinand called it from day dot, hailing him as a talent to be reckoned with in a personal video shown to Yoro during his first interview at the club.",
      "“You’ve got all the potential, you’ve got all the tools, man, you’ve got everything there, ready to rock and roll to go and make a big impact at this club.”",
      "And United have Ferdinand to thank (along with quite significantly superior wages) for luring him to the club amid competition for his signature from Real Madrid.",
      "“It was like two weeks ago [when I first spoke to Rio],” Yoro explained last summer. “He called me. First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice. It was really an honour to speak with him.”",
      "Say what you want about Ferdinand, his YouTuber schtick on commentary and whatever else, but he is a proper Manchester United legend with 455 appearances for the club to his name and 12 trophies. It must have been quite the call to receive and Ferdinand continues to sing Yoro’s praises.",
      "“I love him. I don’t know where is ceiling is, but he could be anything,” the former United defender told United We Stand on Monday.",
      "“He just needs the pieces around him as well to help him as a young kid, but I think he has the nucleus of all the right traits to be a top centre half and he will be because he wants to be as well.",
      "“He’s a hard worker and he’s diligent, but he needs time as well.”",
      "And it looks as though he backed and is backing the right horse in Yoro. Having got through last season without being one of the innumerable United problems, he’s now asserting himself as one of the nailed on solutions.",
      "We wouldn’t want him to be tarred by the same brush as Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund or Kobbie Mainoo, but any new list of Manchester United ‘untouchables’ would surely include him, maybe with Matthijs de Ligt and Amad Diallo, but also quite possibly him alone, with the new signings yet to prove themselves and others struggling to meet the requirements of consistent quality and youth for that label.",
      "Rio Ferdinand thinks the decision from Man Utd not to push the boat out for Harry Kane is “the biggest mistake they’ve made in the last ten years”.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been told to transform one of his centre-backs into a defensive midfielder this season to “plug a gap”.",
      "Rio Ferdinand thinks Gabriel Magalhaes will come round to the idea that he was “probably right” to criticise him in the defender’s early days at Arsenal.",
      "Rio Ferdinand believes Man Utd have got a player who’s “got a massive chance” of becoming a superstar at Old Trafford as he reminds him of Wayne Rooney.",
      "Alexander Isak and his camp require clarity on one key “detail” for Liverpool to complete his signing this summer as Ferdinand highlights Newcastle’s “big mistake”.",
      "After their pursuit of Carlos Baleba went cold, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has given his old club another target they should go after."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have already been dealt a ‘huge’ blow as they consider whether to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton in January.",
      "Man Utd were active in this summer’s transfer window as one of the biggest spending clubs in Europe, investing around £230m to sign Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Red Devils also sanctioned several high-profile exits to raise funds, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony among their notable departees.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd failed to sign a new centre-midfielder after discovering that a big-money move for top target Baleba was unfeasible in the summer.",

      "READ: Man Utd goalkeepers ranked: Onana flops out of top 10 ahead of Turkey transfer",
      "This means centre-midfield remains a weak spot in Ruben Amorim’s squad, though they are ‘expected to return’ for Baleba in the coming months.",
      "The winter window is the earliest opportunity for Man Utd to land Baleba, though Football Insider have explained why their ‘chances of signing him in January’ are pretty low.",
      "The report has also indicated Man Utd’s likely next step regarding Baleba as a ‘huge’ January deal is unlikely.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Sources say that the Seagulls are likely to slap a huge price tag on Baleba, which United wouldn’t be able to afford in January.",
      "‘Despite having little to no chance of wrapping up a deal for Baleba in January, Man United may have more success if they return again next summer. By then, the Cameroonian international will have just two years remaining on his contract at the AMEX, which may mean he is available for a more realistic price.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano, meanwhile, has indicated that Man Utd “really appreciated” one thing about Baleba in the summer.",
      "“I’m not surprised Man United did not invest in any other midfielders during the summer transfer window,” Romano said.",
      "“I’m not surprised because I always told you that my feeling is that Man United will keep their interest alive in 2026 for Carlos Baleba.",
      "“I’m sure that he will not be cut off the list for Man United in 2026, they were very happy with the player opening the door for them even without Champions League or European football.",
      "“Baleba was very open to joining Man United and the club really appreciated that.”",
      "Man Utd are reportedly planning to break their transfer record in 2026 to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford as part of a double coup.",
      "Man Utd are set to return for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in the future after the Red Devils agreed personal terms, according to reports.",

      "“No one should like coming to Old Trafford. It’s that simple. Last season you had, no disrespect to these teams, but the likes of Wolves running all over us at home. The fear factor has to come back.",
      "“Even if we know they aren’t going to win the league or finish in the top four, against the likes of Arsenal or Manchester City or Liverpool at Old Trafford, United still have to put a real shift in and give them a proper game.",
      "“You might draw or lose 1-0, but they have to look like they’re back on the up. The away form has always been good. The fans travel in their numbers and are amazing. When things aren’t going well, it seems to be the home games that are the toughest.",

Romero was competent – even if some of his distribution was ropey – but was never likely to usurp De Gea, even when the Spaniard was out of form. Similar to Kuszczak, things got messy in the end, with Romero spending much of his last season away from the squad while his wife urged the club to let him go when Everton were sniffing.",
      "",
      "When it was decided that De Gea wasn’t Erik ten Hag’s type, and that United needed a more modern goalkeeper, Onana was identified as the ideal candidate. Most people agreed – indeed, the Cameroonian was expected to make a big difference to how United could build. No one can pretend there was any dissent to his signing.",
      "So we were all wrong. Has Onana made a difference to United in possession? Nope. Is that his fault? Not entirely.",
      "But it is his responsibility to stop the ball going in the net, and that fundamental task for any goalkeeper – traditional or modern – is what he has struggled with most. Onana has pulled off some great saves. But he’s dropped many a bollock. And even when he makes saves, too often they are parries back into danger. Such unpredictability is not a price worth paying for a playmaker in gloves. Which, as we now know , he’s not anyway.",
      "As this list highlights, you need to be a big character to fill the goal at Old Trafford. And Onana certainly has the necessary ego. But too much of his bravado seems misplaced. Goalkeepers need to ooze self-belief, and they can fake it to some extent when they don’t always feel it, but that assurance needs to spread throughout the team. Onana puts everyone around him on edge.",
      "Ruben Amorim has enough problems without an anxiety-inducing goalkeeper. He’s Trabzonspor’s problem now, for this season at least.",
      "",
      "Leighton was Ferguson’s first goalkeeping signing, brought in 1988 for £750,000 from Aberdeen where the pair had enjoyed great success together. The Scotland No.1 had a reasonable first season in a poor United side which finished 11th in Division One. Still, Leighton kept 14 clean sheets and conceded more than twice on only one occasion in all competitions.",
      "It all fell apart towards the end of his second campaign at Old Trafford. Ferguson was clinging to his job while United shambled their way to a 13th-placed finish. An FA Cup run saved Ferguson – but it buried Leighton.",
      "The No.1 had a poor game, one of a few in 1990, in the final with two of Crystal Palace’s three goals pinned on Leighton. Ferguson made a stunning call to drop him for the replay, bringing in Les Sealey, then on loan from Luton. It proved to be a masterstroke, with Sealey relishing his moment in the spotlight, keeping a clean sheet while Leighton looked shattered in the stands.",
      "Leighton played only once more for United – a League Cup game against Halifax at The Shay – with his relationship with Ferguson irreparably broken. “We’ve never spoken since, and never will do again,” said the keeper in 2018.",
      "It took Leighton three years before he began rebuilding his career north of the border with Hibs, where he regained his international place. Indeed, Leighton said he played the best football of his career at Easter Road before coming full circle to finish his career at Aberdeen aged 41.",
      "",
      "Carroll was signed from Wigan in 2001, initially to be back up to Fabien Barthez, with a view to perhaps one day replacing the Frenchman. That finally happened late in his second season when Ferguson lost faith in Barthez amid a title battle with Arsenal.",
      "Carroll helped get United over the line but was immediately presented with a new challenge when Tim Howard turned up. The American won the battle for the gloves in his first year but his second season saw an even contest with no outright winner.",
      "It was during that season, amid a run of 22 Premier League matches for United, that Carroll got away with fumbling Pedro Mendes’ late, long-distance hoik, a moment that is now inextricably linked with his name. More costly was a mistake in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie against AC Milan which prompted another rotation.",
      "Carroll left at the end of that season when Ferguson finally stopped faffing with his keepers.",
      "",
      "Few had heard of Howard when he was signed from NY/NJ Metrostars in 2003 for £2.3million. But the then-24-year-old was thrust straight into the United team with Ferguson having run out of patience with Barthez.",
      "His first season started well and all seemed to be going swimmingly until March, when Howard parried a late Porto free-kick in the Champions League last 16 to prompt Jose Mourinho’s touchline dash and kickstart the Portuguese manager’s ascent to become one of Ferguson’s main foes.",
      "After that, Howard struggled for consistent form. In 2004/05, he and Carroll auditioned for the role of United’s No. 1 but both kept fumbling their lines so the job went to Van der Sar.",
      "Howard went to become one of the Premier League’s most reliable keepers at Everton. Perhaps if he’d gone to Everton first, he’d have been ready to take the responsibility at United later in his career.",
      "",
      "Walsh is the only homegrown keeper on this list, and were it not for injuries, he might have ranked considerably higher.",
      "The Wigan-born stopper was given his debut in Ferguson’s sixth league game in charge at Old Trafford. Fergie inherited Chris Turner – and Gary Bailey, but by then injuries had taken their toll – but evidently preferred Walsh, despite the teenager’s inexperience.",
      "Walsh ended Ferguson’s first season as No.1 and began the 1987/88 season with the gloves. But a serious head injury, sustained in a mid-season friendly in Bermuda in which Ferguson brought himself on as a centre-forward, ended the youngster’s campaign, at the end of which Ferguson moved for Leighton.",
      "Walsh stuck around for seven more seasons but never threatened to regain the No.1 spot or fulfil the potential that made Fergie put an 18-year-old in his net. His final season, as one of Schemeichel’s back-ups in 1994/95, saw Walsh play the most games since his initial breakthrough, but he had to leave Old Trafford – first for Middlesbrough then Bradford – to forge a career as a No.1.",
      "",
      "Far too handsome to be a first-choice goalkeeper, Van der Gouw was a hugely reliable presence for Ferguson when he needed a back-up for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "When Schmeichel left and it quickly became clear that Bosnich wasn’t up to the job of replacing the Great Dane, Van der Gouw once again stepped in with no fuss to guard United’s goal while Ferguson tried again to find a successor to Schmeichel. That was the only season in which he made enough appearances to qualify for a title winner’s medal.",
      "Overall, in six seasons at Old Trafford, Van der Gouw managed 60 appearances. Now in his 60s, he still looks like he might do a job…",
      "",
      "",
      "A post shared by Gary Neville (@gneville2)",
      "None of what the modern goalkeeper is doing is revolutionary. Barthez was playing as an 11th outfielder at Old Trafford 25 years ago.",
      "Having failed with his initial attempts to replace Schmeichel, first with Bosnich then Taibi, Ferguson turned to Barthez in 2000. The France star, a World Cup and European Championship winner, was one of only three keepers Fergie felt could improve his team. The others: Oliver Kahn and Gianluigi Buffon. Hence why he paid Monaco £7.8million for the then 28-year-old.",
      "His first season was brilliant fun. Barthez saved penalties and quite often took the p*ss out of opposition strikers. Paolo Di Canio gave it back when he knocked United out of the FA Cup while Barthez tried to pretend he had been flagged offside, but overall, the French keeper was a huge hit.",
      "Until he wasn’t. His second season saw Barthez make more mistakes but Ferguson considered the risk to be worth the reward. In his third campaign, Fergie’s patience finally snapped and Barthez was bombed out after the defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Carroll came in and Barthez was packed off back to Marseille.",
      "",
      "Sealey wasn’t United’s No.1 for a long time, but he was determined to make it a good time…",
      "His selection for the 1990 FA Cup final replay stunned everyone – especially Leighton – but Ferguson got the massive call right. “Was he a better keeper than Jim? No, but he thought he was, and that can sometimes be important.”",
      "Palace wrongly thought they could rough him up at Wembley but the brash Cockney wasn’t to be intimidated by them or the job of being Fergie’s No.1 the following season. Sealey was superb and became a Stretford End favourite. As Ferguson said, the ex-Luton veteran wasn’t the most technically accomplished stopper or the finest physical specimen. But he  defended United’s goal as if his life depended on it.",
      "It almost did. In the 1991 League Cup final, Sealey received a gash to his knee that almost went to the bone. Despite being urged to come off, the keeper was having none of it. He demanded to be strapped up and allowed to continue. Later, with an infection in the wound, he collapsed in the airport on the way back to Manchester. Had he boarded the flight, it might have cost Sealey his leg or possibly his life.",
      "Inevitably he was back, with a heavily bandaged knee, for the European Cup Winners’ Cup final against Barcelona a few weeks later, helping Ferguson to win his second trophy after playing such a huge role in the first. That summer, Schmeichel came in and Sealey departed, briefly, before Ferguson brought him back to serve as Schmeichel’s understudy.",
      "Tragically, Sealey suffered a heart attack and died seven years after leaving United for a second time in 1994.",
      "",
      "You might reasonably argue that De Gea merits a higher ranking. Some suggested in the wake of his departure in 2023 that he could be viewed as United’s best ever, with four Player of the Season awards presented as evidence.",
      "It’s a compelling argument, reinforced by his longevity. Only six players have ever played more games for United than the Spaniard they signed in 2011 from Atletico Madrid. He arrived a boy, one who didn’t look likely to be around very long, but went on to become one of the world’s best goalkeepers.",
      "But, somewhere along the line, perhaps around the time he signed that massive new deal in 2019, De Gea became outdated. He slipped from being Spain’s No.1 to being overlooked completely, while obvious flaws in his game weren’t corrected.",
      "It came to a head in 2022/23 when it became clear that De Gea wasn’t Ten Hag’s type. Still, he made some wonderful saves – dropped a few clangers too – to the point that Ten Hag seemed to feel he would be able to make do with the 32-year-old. Until the manager changed his mind and decided that replacing De Gea had become a priority during what was a huge summer. One they made a complete bollocks of.",
      "United should have handled his exit far better and only this summer did he receive the send off he deserved when he returned with Fiorentina for a pre-season friendly. That, and the fact it was the right call if clumsily processed, does not denigrate a stellar United career played out under six permanent managers. But this pair, perhaps helped by the fact they were fortunate to play in far better teams, make a better case for the top two spots…",
      "",
      "Ferguson put it best in his autobiography…",
      "‘We had a bad period trying to replace Peter Schmeichel. It’s maybe not my strong point. It wasn’t until we brought in Edwin that we got back to the level we had with Peter. Edwin was a great buy for us, absolutely brilliant. Looking back, I just wish we’d got him when Peter decided to leave.’",
      "United signed six senior keepers in the six years between Schmeichel’s departure and Van der Sar’s arrival. Perhaps that period gave the Holland international the chance to better prepare for the demands of the role. When he finally arrived, close to turning 35, he was experienced enough to handle the pressure and, frankly, make the job that so many others struggled with look a piece of p*ss.",
      "Despite his age, Van der Sar kept Fergie’s goal for six seasons, eventually retiring aged 40. The ex-Ajax, Juventus and Fulham keeper, with 130 caps, won four Premier League titles and played a huge role in winning the Champions League for United in 2008. Sure, it helped playing behind Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, but Van der Sar was a flawless presence and a key cog in arguably Ferguson’s best-ever side.",
      "",
      "United’s best-ever keeper. Arguably the game’s greatest ever.",
      "Between 1991 and 1999, Schmeichel filled United’s goal, if not by his physical bulk then by the sheer heft of his personality. The Great Dane was a force too intimidating for many strikers, with most wilting as they raced through with only Schmeichel to beat.",
      "In those one-on-one situations, Schmeichel made mainstream the star-shaped smoother, blocking out the entire goal behind him, with arms and legs akimbo. His distribution added another new dimension to United, with an arrowed throw so long it turned opposition defences. Some other aspects of his technique were untidy but goalkeeping is an art and Schmeichel had it mastered.",
      "He kept goal throughout United’s first title under Ferguson, their first and second doubles and, of course, the Treble, bringing down the curtain on his United career with the 1999 Champions League final. Schmeichel later came to regret leaving prematurely and some may feel he tarnished his legacy somewhat by returning to the Premier League with Villa and then Manchester City. But only the most churlish United fan would view Schmeichel’s achievements any less favourably for what came after an incredible eight-season stint making United’s goal the most secure in England.",
      "What you have to do with Chelsea is to stop viewing them as a football club altogether…",
      "We all laughed at the England call-up for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but is a 15-year-old really the best alternative?",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a key “decision” to prevent a “problem” at the club.",
      "There has been very little meat and a lot of gravy from Thomas Tuchel’s England so far.",
      "For the first time in a quarter of a century, Spurs fans don’t reflexively and instantly know who they should blame if it does all go horribly wrong.",
      "All eyes were on Michelle Agyemang and she didn’t deliver on the opening day, but Ornella Vignola certainly did on debut in the Merseyside derby."

      "Despite 10 goals and 12 assists for Leverkusen last season, Wirtz has so far delivered no goals and a single assist in two league outings, with a muted 0.34 xG per 90. Like Verón, whose technical brilliance never fully translated, and Kagawa, who shone briefly before tactical misfit dulled his influence, Wirtz looks more like a passenger than the conductor of Slot’s midfield orchestra.",
      "And before anyone says “give him time,” remember Kevin De Bruyne? He rocked up at City, scored on his first start, and finished his debut season with 16 goals and 15 assists despite missing two months injured. Some players don’t need bedding in — they just set the tempo from day one.",
      "It’s a bit like Coldplay adding a flashy new guitarist whose solos tore up small venues but don’t quite blend with the band’s stadium sound. Verón had the pedigree, Kagawa had the flair, and Wirtz has the creative CV—but in each case, the timing, chemistry, and rhythm never quite clicked.",

      "One person and one person alone is responsible for Liverpool’s ascendency to transfer market goliaths: Mikel Arteta.",
      "Let me set the scene. It’s the summer of 2024, Liverpool’s legendary manager has just rejected them and decided he would rather manage no team than spend another season managing Liverpool. The directors move swiftly to bring in their own version of Erik Ten Hag and Liverpool supporters were basically dreading the season ahead. Liverpool were primed to be sent back to the Stoneage for a Man Utd esq period of under achievement.",
      "All Arteta had to do was freshen up the attack that had clearly started to wane over the course of the previous season but the team as whole was strong. But what does he do? He decides to strengthen considerably what was already the meanest defence in the league. He spends over £100 million on a goalkeeper, a defender (who rarely played) and a midfielder (who rarely played). I know people will say Raya was an upgrade and he EVENTUALLY was but Ramsdale was a fine keeper but lacked a bit of maturity that could have been coached into him.",
      "Liverpool were there for the taking last season if any club would’ve put them under a little bit of pressure but they basically got a free ride to the title. Arteta thought that Martinelli (deplorable form for a whole season, confidence looks shot) and Jesus (perma-crock, deplorable form also) should be a core part of the Arsenal attack for the coming season. The only new attacking recruit was Sterling, whose form has been deplorable yet again for a couple of seasons. I know people say hindsight is twenty-twenty and all that but that’s just gross negligence.",
      "Arsenal inevitably wilted as the sticky part of the season hit and that Liverpool team was made to look more dominant and hell of a lot better than they actually were. They should’ve finished second or even third had there been a half-functioning Man City. And on the back of that kind of season, do you think they’re getting Wirtz and Isak, I don’t think so. Arteta deployed the usual Mourinho-esqe approach to management, winning through playing defensively so the manager gets all the credit, rather than winning with attacking flare and the players getting all the credit. This approach massively affected his transfer market priorities, with a raft of defence signings coming in. Defensively minded coaches are ego maniacs, simple as.",
      "On a brighter note, here in Sweden I would say about half of the Liverpool supporters I’ve talked to aren’t actually happy with the Isak signing, as they see him as lazy and someone who could cause problems in the dressing room. There’s one thing you can say about the Swedes and that is they’re very patriotic, they follow their national players diligently. A bad egg and lazy, wouldn’t that be nice.",

I get why they are offering huge wages to attract the players but why are they paying over the odds for transfers? £56.6 million for Darwin Nunez ffs! No one else was paying anywhere near that for him and any club would be happy to sell players to a league that can’t possibly compete with them in European competitions. Doesn’t make sense to me.

Spurs signed players like Gareth Bale and hidden gems like Luka Modrić and Berbatov, who were doubted but ended up being world-class and made the club a ton of money.",

Perhaps he’s trying to give enough players a chance to shine in training, see if they can quickly adopt his tactics and take their chance when given a cap. With Palmer, Saka and Bellingham all missing and Foden still effectively out of form, 4 key flair players who can open up teams were missing. But he chose players like Gibbs-White and only gave him a cameo, neglected Grealish (who was great when employed as the 10 last time out for England) and the lack of invention showed.",

Not quite sure what that is as they all play very differently and, lets face it, do it with the bulk of their teams not being English. If he meant, high energy, high pressing, I get it.

Almería absolutely boss the opening 20 minutes, playing some intricate football while showing good defensive organization with the full backs doing modern full back things. As a result they are 2-0 up and the “Ultras” sat in the next section of stand – complete with shirtless chaps – are creating a brilliant atmosphere.",

      "The coach brings off Nico the tidy 10, who was helping to control things, for a defensive midfielder, inviting a whole bunch of trouble and predictably everything falls asunder. Two goals within a minute of each other make it 2-2 and the ref may want to make a swift exit at full time. Almeria’s makes changes to introduce some pace. He brings on number 7, Lazaro, who goes though one on one shortly after, looks surprised to find himself in tons of space and then hits the Santander keeper so hard in the face with the ball that play is stopped. We’re still at 2-2. Then, Almería’s coach takes off Baba, the man holding the defense together and within minutes it’s 3-2.",

      "Andre Onana’s reward for being a Manchester United goalkeeping flop is a Turkish league title fight and doubled wages.",
      "The Cameroonian’s final game in a United shirt might be the humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby after he secured a season-long loan move to Turkish club Trabzonspor.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, not only will Onana be parachuted into a title challenge with Trabzonspor unbeaten in their first four games to leave themselves just two points behind leaders Galatasaray, but he will double his wages during his season in Turkey.",
      "Transfer journalist Ben Jacobs also reported: ‘Onana will earn more than at Utd due to the sign-on and bonuses offered by Trabzonspor.’",
      "He will also have the honour of playing alongside former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic for a club about to lose their first-team goalkeeper – who has conceded just once in four games – to Galatasaray.",
      "Onana has been heavily criticised at United since his £47.2m move two years ago and will be very glad to be out of the limelight at Old Trafford; he was expected to stay and fight for his place after the arrival of £21.7m keeper Senne Lammens from Antwerp.",
      "But you can hardly blame him for choosing to escape the cold of north-west England and double his wages in Turkey.",
      "United will receive no loan fee for Onana’s move and Trabzonspor have not agreed a fee if they wish to sign him permanently next summer.",
      "Old Trafford boss Ruben Amorim was riled by criticism of Onana after the defeat to Grimsby, saying: “With all due respect, when you play against a fourth-division team, it’s not the goalkeeper, it’s everything.”",
      "Speaking on ESPN FC, former Manchester City and Queens Park Rangers defender Nedem Onuoha said: “If he ends up leaving what a horrendous spell that’s been, I remember when he first came over and he played in the Champions League final for Inter and was such a big part of what they were about and before that when he was at Ajax.",
      "“Then to come to United and not leave any sort of legacy is hugely disappointing from his standpoint, and with a replacement coming in, in Lammens that’s tough.",
      "“You’ve been replaced this early with a new manager, but we can see why, we can see the errors we can see the confidence being drained away from and the confidence of the manager losing faith in what he can be as a goalkeeper.",
      "“When he first came in we all thought he’d help United with their build up, but in the two years he’s been there we’ve not seen that, so he’s ended up being classed as a flop which is a shame from his perspective.",
      "“He should’ve enjoyed those years he could’ve been helping United get on to that next level but instead he ends up joining a list of goalkeepers who have been a parody at United.”",
      "What you have to do with Chelsea is to stop viewing them as a football club altogether…",
      "We all laughed at the England call-up for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but is a 15-year-old really the best alternative?",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a key “decision” to prevent a “problem” at the club.",
      "As Man Utd wave off another goalkeeper, we’ve ranked the 13 regulars to guard their goal since Fergie arrived. Andre Onana doesn’t come out of this well…",
      "There has been very little meat and a lot of gravy from Thomas Tuchel’s England so far.",
      "For the first time in a quarter of a century, Spurs fans don’t reflexively and instantly know who they should blame if it does all go horribly wrong."

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have decided whether to ‘send Marcus Rashford’ home to Manchester United by ‘breaking an agreement’.",
      "In the summer, Rashford secured a dream move to Barcelona as he joined Hansi Flick’s side from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy.",

      "The flashy winger was deemed surplus to requirements at Man Utd after he fell out with head coach Ruben Amorim last season. He was part of their so-called ‘bomb squad’, which also included Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford.",

      "READ: Benjamin Sesko mask slips as Kobbie Mainoo move ‘personally blocked’",

      "“£40 million is all profit for United, so they’ve done okay on the balance sheet with that. But I don’t know why they didn’t stick with him. Obviously there was a falling out there with Amorim.",

      "“Chelsea will be able to sell him on, having used him well this season, or next season as well.",

      "What an extraordinarily depressing quote that is, and for so many reasons. The way in which Thomas Tuchel breezes through several dispiriting barriers to England winning the World Cup next summer in the space of two sentences is almost impressive.",
      "We’re not done with anger yet in the five stages of grief at Henderson being selected again, so we’re a ways off accepting he’s genuinely competing for a midfield spot and yet, when you look at the alternatives, we wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him starting against Andorra on Saturday.",
      "We would much rather see Anderson or Loftus-Cheek alongside Rice, but with this being the former’s first call-up and the latter’s first for nearly seven years, we’re prepared for Hendo doing his shouty thing and plenty of finger-pointing while displaying that all-important trait: mobility.",
      "Quite apart from questioning whether a 35-year-old can even be counted in a class of “very mobile players”, it’s hardly the exciting midfield characteristic one would hope is being picked out by the manager of one of the best international teams in the world as being key to success. “Wow, did you see how mobile he was there?” Jesus.",
      "And why is there “not one deep number six”, Thomas? England need one. Obviously. Every football team in the world has one. England are not going to win the World Cup without one. So don’t replace an injured Adam Wharton – surely the best bet to fill that gap as things stand – with Loftus-Cheek. It makes no sense.",
      "What about Angel Gomes? He’s starting in midfield for Marseille and was arguably the standout player of Lee Carsley’s caretaker reign. Archie Gray, maybe? It doesn’t really matter. This is the first of three international breaks before the World Cup and England need to be playing games of football with a No.6.",
      "And no, not John Stones. Why would you look to fix England’s biggest problem by weakening its second biggest? All things being equal, it should be Stones and Marc Guehi as the Three Lions centre-back pairing. Again, obviously.",
      "Tuchel could do with a midfield bolt from the blue. Someone to come from nowhere to provide a solution; to vie with Wharton for that starting spot which he looks very much on course to merit but will also be his by default.",

Mainoo meanwhile continues to be told that his only option of breaking into the first team is through ousting captain and talisman Fernandes. But why?",
      "He’s a 20-year-old footballer who is by all accounts a hard-working professional who’s very clearly desperate to be playing football this season in order to go to the World Cup this summer.",
      "We can think of no individual more open to being coached (imagine that?) into playing a slightly different role which would see him play every game for club and ensure his place in the England squad next summer. There’s literally no downside.",

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 18:08, UK",
      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title.

      "Fulham left it late to sign striker Kevin in a club-record deal of £34.6m from Shakhtar Donetsk and force through a loan move for Bayern Munich forward Jonah Kusi-Asare, but it was still an underwhelming summer for Marco Silva's side.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £18.2m deal to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens; the Belgian shot stopper is now one of four goalkeepers at Man Utd, though they could sell any of the other goalkeepers to Saudi Arabia or Turkey as their windows close later",
      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed the Deadline Day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "United have agreed a deal for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper for around £18.2m plus add-ons.",
      "The club looked at other options, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but after much deliberation and negotiation, they feel Lammens is the right choice for the club moving forward.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper impressed United. No 'keeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United will move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Altay Bayindir, Andre Onana and Tom Heaton.",
      "However, the windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia are open until September 11 and 10, respectively.",
      "It is understood that if a suitable offer were to come in for their other goalkeepers, it would be considered.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously said he was happy with his goalkeeping department, despite several high-profile errors from Onana and Bayindir across the early stages of the season.",
      "Lammens is now the fifth signing of the summer for Amorim, taking their summer spend to £232m, following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The keeper was signed two years ago from Club Brugge and the sale represents nearly 100 per cent profit for the Belgian club.",
      "He made 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League last season for Antwerp, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "Speaking on the club's official channels after signing, Lammens said:",
      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years.",
      "\"I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben [Amorim] and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.\"",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, added: \"Senne is an excellent young goalkeeper with great potential.",
      "\"We are delighted that he has chosen to join Manchester United after significant interest from a number of clubs.\"",
      "\"Manchester United have signed Senne Lammens with an eye to the now as well as the future.",
      "\"The 23-year-old keeper, tipped to be Thibaut Courtois' successor in the Belgium national side, is seen as the best solution to strengthen an underperforming goalkeeping department after a shaky start to the season by the likes of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "\"It's no secret they looked at other options, such as tried and tested Emiliano Martinez at Aston Villa, but with all factors considered, United felt Lammens was the direction they wanted to go in.",
      "\"Although Lammens has limited experience - only one season as a first-choice No 1 at Royal Antwerp, United are confident in Lammens' potential to compete immediately as well as having room to grow with a side that has the ultimate aim to win the Premier League title in three years time.\"",
      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",
      "\"An interesting thing is that when Ruben Amorim was at Sporting, they were tracking him then. So there's obviously been a like there for quite some time.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
      "\"It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you recover from them, your body language, and whether you look authoritative. [Onana and Bayindir] don't fill that role.\""

      "\"It could be the perfect move for both the player and a team currently lacking a spark in the final third.",
      "\"Three goals and four assists in 31 appearances while on loan at Chelsea last season was a modest return, but it is difficult to carve a way into Enzo Maresca's bloated squad.",
