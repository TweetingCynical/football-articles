      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba will be on the move “soon” amid strong interest from Manchester United. The Cameroonian midfielder has been a long-term target of the Red Devils.",
      "They were initially interested in the summer, albeit Brighton’s £100m price-tag eventually put them off. But that interest hasn’t dropped entirely.",
      "Baleba remains a key target of United chiefs ahead of a huge midfield rebuild at Old Trafford. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher are among their alternative targets.",
      "But now Baleba has been backed to complete a mega-money move to one of the Premier League’s big boys by former Mali international Cedric Kante. Speaking to Africa Foot, he said: “Manchester United have been interested in him for some time now, especially during the last summer transfer window.",
      "“It doesn’t really surprise me, as the club has the resources to sign him and offer him a very high salary. In my opinion, yes, Baleba will sign with a big English club soon. It seems a done deal.",
      "“Now, the question is when the Cameroonian will leave Brighton. If a club comes in with an offer of over €100 million, his management will find it hard to refuse. And whoever signs him will be getting a good deal: he’s a reliable, consistent player they can count on.”",
      "Baleba, 21, signed for Brighton from Lille in 2023 and he has gone on to make 91 appearances for the South Coast club. He has two-and-a-half years remaining on his deal at the AMEX Stadium.",
      "Should he depart, he could become the latest high-profile star to leave the club after Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Alexis Mac Allister, Leandro Trossard and Robert Sanchez, among others.",
      "Explaining why United failed to sign Baleba in the summer, Brighton chief Tony Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.”",
      "Baleba and his Brighton teammates will be back in action this weekend as they take on Brentford at home. Meanwhile, United will be aiming to extend their five-game unbeaten run on Monday evening as they welcome Everton to Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have to wait until Monday to get back in action after the international break - but that could actually be a blessing in disguise. The Red Devils welcome Everton to Old Trafford in a few days’ time.",
      "And Ruben Amorim will certainly hope to use that time to his advantage given the injuries that United are contending with. A number of stars were dealing with issues ahead of the international break including Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and more.",
      "The club’s injury woes then got even worse with Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire both being withdrawn in the late 2-2 draw with Tottenham. And that leaves the United boss with a few tricky decisions to make ahead of Monday’s clash with Everton.",
      "Starting in goal, summer signing Senne Lammens appears to have secured the number one shirt and that should continue against Everton. But the defence in front of the Belgian stopper will look slightly different.",
      "Maguire has been ruled out with injury, while Kobbie Mainoo is another possible absentee. Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: “Maguire is not ready, Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see.”",
      "That could see Leny Yoro drafted into the starting XI. Luke Shaw and Matthijs de Ligt should be selected as his fellow centre-backs.",
      "Moving into midfield, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu should be stationed as wing-backs. The latter is just one yellow card away from a ban but should still be fine to play.",
      "In midfield, Casemiro seems fit to play, with captain Bruno Fernandes remaining as one of the first names on the teamsheet. Moving into attack, Matheus Cunha and Amad look set to start once again, having been in the starting XI vs Tottenham.",
      "There is the headache of what to do when it comes to the striker position. Sesko remains ruled out with a knee injury he picked up vs Tottenham.",
      "Speaking about the forward, Amorim said: “He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long but it is not that serious we have to be careful with him. He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.",
      "“I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don't want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.”",
      "That should see Bryan Mbeumo lead to line in Sesko’s place against Everton, despite Joshua Zirkzee being an option. Cunha could play centrally as a false No.9 as well.",
      "Man Utd possible XI vs Everton: Lammens; Shaw, Yoro, De Ligt; Dorgu, Fernandes, Casemiro, Mazraoui; Cunha, Amad, Mbeumo.",

      "Manchester United's players are spending more and more time at the training ground following the huge refurbishment that took place at Carrington, with the club pouring money into their infrastructure.",
      "The team are on their best run of the Ruben Amorim era, unbeaten in their last five Premier League games, which includes three wins, and the dedication at their training base seems to have ramped up with individuals reporting in early and clocking out later than they need to.",
      "Players are arriving up to an hour early for training sessions, reports The Sun. The majority of players tend to head in just after 8am for an official arrival time of 9am.",
      "Some are also staying later, which is largely to take on extras specific to their position once the squad training has finished. A major factor has been the new state-of-the art facilities available to them, which cost the club £50million.",
      "The Carrington-base recently had a glow-up and some players are spending up to seven hours on the premises. A larger communal area, which includes a pool table, a games room and barbershop, is believed to be particularly popular with United players.",
      "United players showcased their dedication following the recent win over Liverpool. They recorded a first win at Anfield for a decade and once they returned home a number began their recovery process that Sunday evening by having saunas and ice baths.",
      "Such activities have become common practice with some players who are regarded among the most dedicated on the planet. Cristiano Ronaldo's regime has long been raved about whilst Mohamed Salah has been known for undergoing late night sessions.",
      "Bringing the team together was a real motivating factor behind the training ground development. The project lasted around a year but after it was finished equipment and technology had been upgraded throughout, with a focus on fitness, nutrition, recovery and team unity.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe said when it opened: “While a world-class facility won’t take us to that place alone, I think it is one of the key ingredients in the modern world. I think here now we have a world-class training facility.",
      "“Thanks to Ruben and the sports staff for being adaptable for the last 12 months. It was a difficult year, and it was not the perfect training facilities that you had to put up with. I hope you enjoy your new home and I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",

      "Reports in Spain state he then attempted to return to training at Ciutat Esportiva on Friday morning, but was sent home shortly after 9am.",
      "According to Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo, Rashford is battling a 'severe cold' and fever. The 28-year-old reportedly showed up to training on Friday still displaying symptoms.",
      "Rashford is one of only two Barcelona players to have played every game so far this season. But the winger's absence so close to Saturday's La Liga clash with Athletic Club has sparked serious concerns that he could miss the game.",
      "Should he be ruled out, it would be a major disappointment for the forward, as Hansi Flick's side are set to play at Camp Nou for the first time in over two years.",
      "The club are reportedly expected to release a medical statement on Friday explaining his recent absence. Flick said in his press conference: \"Marcus has a fever and was out yesterday and today, and I have doubts about whether he'll be available tomorrow.\"",
      "Rashford, who is on loan in Catalonia until the end of the season, has been in scintillating form this campaign. The United academy graduate has an impressive six goals and nine assists in just 16 appearances across all competitions.",
      "His standout performances came in the Champions League against Newcastle and Olympiacos, where he netted two goals in each game, having also provided an assist in last month's 2-1 El Clasico defeat.",
      "There is some positive news for Flick as Joan Garcia, Raphinha, Marc Casado and Lamine Yamal are all available for Saturday after recovering from injuries. However, midfield sensation Pedri is a doubt as he has been training separately all week.",

      "Arsenal owner Josh Kroenke wanted to sign Manchester United star Benjamin Sesko instead of Viktor Gyokeres this summer. The Gunners bolstered their attacking ranks with the signing of the Swedish forward back in July.",
      "After extensive negotiations, Arsenal agreed to pay Sporting Lisbon £55m plus add-ons for Gyokeres. And he has enjoyed a productive start to life in North London, netting six goals in 14 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Gyokeres might never have become an Arsenal player at all had Kroenke had his way however. According to The Independent, the Arsenal owner was not involved in the process of appointing sporting director Andrea Berta and thus had his own transfer targets in mind.",
      "It is revealed that he preferred Sesko over Gyokeres, only to eventually relent. Intriguingly, the Slovenian forward was shortly on his way to the Premier League after completing a £73m move from RB Leipzig to Manchester United.",
      "The 22-year-old has scored just twice since then and now looks set to be sidelined for a month with a knee injury picked up before the international break. Gyokeres in the meantime has received some bizarre criticism, having been slammed as ‘too heavy’.",
      "Former Sweden star Stefan Schwarz said: “I believe with Viktor Gyokeres, he’s not fully fit yet. As well with the new system, new manager, and new teammates, it takes time to develop the understanding. It’s not just the physical part of it, it’s the mental part as well.”",
      "He added: “The strikers will always be counted on for the goals that they are scoring. Hopefully, he’ll start to create and score goals, have a good run, get that real boost, and get a bit lighter because he’s a heavy player. I think that would help.”",
      "But Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta remains fully behind the forward. Speaking after Gyokeres netted twice vs Atletico Madrid last month, the Spaniard said: \"All of us [appreciate Gyokeres] because he makes us a much better team. I think we've become much more unpredictable.",
      "\"He's so physical, opens the spaces for everyone. The way he presses the ball, holds the ball, it's just phenomenal.",
      "\"And then the icing on the cake and the biggest thing that we're going to debate about him is goals. He's scored two very different ones today, and hopefully he starts to get some momentum and a good run of goals.\"",

      "As November international breaks go, this one was probably as compelling as it gets. The whole Jude Bellingham debate gave an edge to England’s two qualifiers - even though their place at World Cup 2026 was already secure - and Troy Parrott’s heroics in Budapest brought a nation to a standstill.",
      "Northern Ireland’s offerings were less spectacular but still effective while Wales were almost flamboyant in celebrating their place in the play-offs. And as for Scotland and Scott McTominay’s bicycle kick and Kenny McLean from the halfway line, there is nothing left to say.",
      "But even so, the return of the Premier League is stocked with storylines, from top to bottom, as the clubs take over for the next four months. As Pep Guardiola said ahead of Manchester City ’s trip to Newcastle : “The real, real, real, season starts now.”",
      "When Arsenal were leading in the dying embers of their match in Sunderland, it looked as though the Gunners were going to march into an eight-point lead at the top of the table. But along came Brian Brobbey and Manchester City’s victory over Liverpool and now, the advantage over Pep Guardiola’s men is only four points.",
      "And here’s a thing. The last time a team was leading after 11 games and did not go on to win the Premier League was in the 2023/24 season. And that team? Arsenal. And their lead then? Four points over Manchester City.",
      "The season, as Pep says, is only really starting now but the North London derby is a contest that will carry extra significance. If Arsenal lose, their temperament will already be under scrutiny.",
      "For reasons for which he should take a fair share of blame, his pre-season was a poor joke and he has been troubled by niggling injuries since arriving at Anfield on September 1. But from Arne Slot ’s point of view, it is surely time for Alexander Isak to step up to the plate.",
      "In the Premier League and Champions League, the £125million man has played 429 minutes of football and has failed to score. Slot has asked for patience when it comes to judging Isak but Liverpool fans will want to soon see why the club went to such lengths to sign him.",
      "After the loss at the Etihad, Liverpool need to get back to winning ways but Nottingham Forest have shown signs of resurgence under Sean Dyche. It won’t be easy for Isak or Slot’s side.",
      "In his first game in charge, a home match against Crystal Palace, Rob Edwards has a lot on his plate … and that is some understatement. Not only is he tasked with trying to bring Wolves a first Premier League win since April - recording 12 losses and three draws in that time - Edwards needs to try and unite a fanbase that has turned against the ownership.",
      "And let’s face it, he needs some sort of miracle to keep Wolves in the top flight. It is toxic at Molineux but that is only because of supporter anger at the way the club has limited its ambition to merely staying in the Premier League.",
      "Selling the best players and then hoping there are three worse teams is a policy that is bound to backfire at some point. But if Edwards can get off to a flier against Palace, you never know.",
      "When there were strong suggestions the Leeds executives might replace Daniel Farke in the summer - despite him taking the club back to the Premier League - the fans pretty much united in support of the manager. And it seems most are still behind him despite recent struggles.",
      "Four defeats in their past five Premier League games, though, means Farke is now the favourite to be the next Premier League manager to leave his post. Yet the visit of Aston Villa on Sunday is not necessarily a win-or-bust moment for Farke.",
      "But what he does need is an improved performance from Leeds, even if they cannot get the victory. Because the losses at Brighton and Nottingham Forest featured the sort of listless displays that get managers the sack.",
      "When Manchester United line up against Everton, it will be exactly one year since Ruben Amorim took charge of his first Premier League game, which ended in an unremarkable draw at Ipswich Town. Along the touchline on Monday night will be David Moyes, who was given less than a year as United boss after losing 15 of his 51 matches.",
      "Amorim has lost 19 of his 54. Moyes had a win percentage of 53 percent, Amorim a win percentage of 39 percent. Those are numbers that show Amorim is, indeed, fortunate to have survived 12 months but the club has faith in him, which is good, AND this is a United squad that is finally beginning to look like one he wants.",
      "That is both in terms of personnel and attitude. It is the start of a run of ten fixtures that look very enticing for United. After Christmas, they could be talked of as title contenders.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim also said that Lisandro Martinez is still unavailable, although the defender is \"getting close\" to making his long-awaited return. United have been without the centre-back since January, when he suffered a serious knee injury, but the Argentina international is now back in training.",
      "Amorim has previously hinted that United may be forced into action in the January transfer window, with Mbeumo heading off to represent Cameroon at AFCON. \"Of course, we are going to have a problem there (AFCON), but we already knew that,\" he said.",
      "“We knew that we would have a lot of players who are not going to play because it’s one game a week, so we knew that trying to manage that situation was going to be hard. Let’s see when the window is open, if we can improve the team, and try to repair something that happened. Until then we have to take the chance. We’ll see.”",

      "Manchester United’s chances of prising Daniel Munoz away from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window have been boosted. Munoz has been a stand-out performer for Palace since joining from Belgian side Genk in 2024 and has not-so-subtly hinted that he is eyeing a move up the food chain.",
      "The 29-year-old has made the right wingback position his own under Oliver Glasner, returning eight goals and 14 assists in 81 appearances for Palace. He is under contract with the south London side until June 2028, but hasn’t hid his desire to test himself elsewhere.",
      "Speaking to AS recently, he said: “First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another. If you ask me, it would be a dream to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United. I think I’m working towards that. I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because for me, it’s a dream to get there.\"",
      "He added: “If you ask me, I don’t have concrete information any of these clubs are interested in me. My focus is on Crystal Palace. We’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer.”",
      "Munoz would appear to be a good fit for United, who also play a three-man defence with wingbacks under Ruben Amorim. The United boss has frequently fielded natural forward Amad Diallo in the right wingback position and his defensive frailties have been exposed at times.",
      "If they were looking to sign Munoz, then United may have taken notice of Palace’s own business interests. According to TZ, Palace and West Ham are monitoring Bayern Munich’s Sacha Boey ahead of the January window opening in the New Year.",
      "Boey has seen his minutes reduced in recent weeks under Vincent Kompany and has reportedly been offered to Juventus. There is no shortage of suitors, however, with Palace and West Ham joined by Monaco, Lyon, Sevilla and Galatasaray all in the picture.",
      "The 25-year-old right-back joined Bayern from Galatasaray in January 2024, but is understood not to be keen to return to Turkey. Instead he sees England, France and Spain as ‘realistic destinations’.",
      "Kompany was forced to reiterate his trust in Boey after the 3-1 win over Chelsea in September in the Champions League. “I made it very clear when the question came up about the size of the squad: for me, it’s important that I have huge trust in every single player I have,” the Bayern manager said.",
      "“There are no exceptions. Sacha is part of that, and his performance against Chelsea was very good – the focus is on the squad, on the team, not on individual players.”",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko was absent from training ahead of Monday night's clash with Everton. The forward limped off against Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, leaving the Reds a man down for the rest of the game.",
      "Sesko headed straight for the tunnel after his injury, and manager Ruben Amorim hinted that he might need to dip into the transfer market if the injury turns out to be a long-term problem.",
      "It remains unclear whether this will be necessary, but Sesko was not seen at Friday morning's training session. Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo were also not seen at the session.",
      "Since making his full debut for United, Sesko has either been chosen to start by Amorim or the team has played without a striker. The latter strategy was used in matches against Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "If Sesko is unavailable, Joshua Zirkzee could be called upon, although so far this season the Dutchman has only played a total of 90 minutes over five appearances.",
      "It seems more likely that United will stick with the same system they used against Spurs. This would involve Amad potentially playing alongside Bryan Mbeumo, with Matheus Cunha leading the line as a false nine.",
      "Alternatively, Mason Mount could be recalled to the starting line-up. He made a strong impression when he came on against Tottenham, setting up two chances for Sesko in the 2-2 draw.",
      "Amorim will give an update on Sesko's injury at his press conference this afternoon. But speaking earlier this month, the United boss hinted that the injury - along with Bryan Mbeumo's impending absence to play in the AFCON - could force them into January transfer business.",

      "Manchester United will not be able to sign Wolves star Joao Gomes by activating a release clause in his contract as the Brazilian doesn't have one with the Midlands club. Gomes, 24, signed a new five-year deal with Wolves in April of this year.",
      "In doing so, the midfielder committed his future to Wolves until 2030. His new deal also reportedly included an option for a further year with the club, who have just appointed Rob Edwards as manager after sacking Vitor Pereira earlier this month.",
      "With no release clause in Gomes' contract, the means through which United were able to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves this summer, the Red Devils could now be at the mercy of Wolves' demands for the star.",
      "Cunha joined United this summer after the Red Devils met his £62.5 million buy-out clause, therefore signing the player at less than his market rate. Gomes is now in his third full season at Molineux, having joined from Flamengo in January 2023 for around £15m.",
      "Such is United's interest in Gomes that Cunha has welcomed the prospect of playing alongside his former team-mate and compatriot at United one day. The United forward even compared him to current United star Casemiro.",
      "\"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive,\" Cunha said. \"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Scott McTominay once humbly expressed his gratitude for being lauded by Sir Alex Ferguson, describing it as a \"huge honour\". The 28-year-old Napoli midfielder, who scored a spectacular opening goal in Scotland's 4-2 triumph over Denmark on Tuesday, has been instrumental in leading Scotland to their first World Cup since 1998.",
      "McTominay's breathtaking overhead kick was the cherry on top of an extraordinary year for him. After leaving United in 2024, he clinched the Serie A title and even earned a nomination for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Despite being deemed surplus to requirements at United, the Scottish ace's stellar performances might have the Red Devils ruing their decision to let him go.",
      "McTominay, who joined United at just five years old, was highly regarded by Sir Alex, who predicted that the young Scot would achieve great things at Old Trafford,",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "Ferguson added: \"McTominay is of a similar type to Darren [Fletcher] - long, lanky, good winner of the ball and a good turn of pace going forward, a great attitude to the game. All these attitudes that Darren Fletcher had, he's got them.",
      "\"Even if you go back to my time with Darren, I very seldom left him out of big games. McTominay is going forward on those guidelines that Darren pursued for a long time at United.\"",
      "Upon receiving such glowing praise from Ferguson, McTominay demonstrated his grounded nature, saying: \"My dad was telling me. It's obviously such a huge honour to be spoken about by someone like Sir Alex, never mind the nice things he was saying about us and Scotland.",
      "\"For me, it's a chance to keep pushing and a chance to not stop pushing forwards, hopefully making everyone proud of me.\"",
      "Following Sir Alex's hospitalisation in November 2018 after falling ill, McTominay also expressed his admiration for the legendary former United chief.",
      "After Scotland's triumph over Israel secured their Euro 2020 spot, he said: \"That was one of Scotland's most important victories and it's dedicated to Sir Alex. Whenever I see him at the United games, I speak to him. He's always up for a chat with me.\"",
      "McTominay left United in August 2024 for £25.7million. The United boss at the time, Erik ten Hag, indicated he would have liked to keep the Scottish midfielder at the club.",
      "\"It is a little bit mixed,\" Ten Hag admitted when questioned about McTominay's departure. \"I am very happy for him, but it is mixed because I wouldn't prefer to lose him. He is Manchester United in everything. He was so important for Manchester United.\"",

      "Premier League clubs have voted AGAINST introducing a salary cap despite a major overhaul of the league's spending rules. The new proposals would have seen the division's previous financial rules binned in favour of a new approach.",
      "All 20 Premier League clubs came together to vote on Friday and it has been decided that anchoring - effectively a salary cap - will not be part of the new system. 12 clubs voted against the proposal, while seven voted for - one club abstained.",
      "However, some major changes have been introduced following the vote. A squad-to-cost ratio will be brought into force. This new guideline will effectively replace the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR). That was voted 14-6, with both Manchester United and Manchester City flipping their stance, which saw the proposal approved.",
      "Under the new approach, clubs are now limited to spending no more then 85 percent of their annual revenue on “football costs”, and that is understood to account for transfer fees and the cost of coaching staff.",
      "That system is very similar to one already in use in UEFA competitions, where 70 percent of revenue can be spent on player expenses.",
      "Another proposal pushed through by clubs were Sustainability and Systemic Resilience rules (SSR) which would see clubs put through a series of tests to ensure financial health. All 20 clubs voted in favour of that rule.",
      "Anchoring in the meantime would have seen a limit put on clubs and how much they can spend on wages and amortisation of transfer fees. That limit would have been based on the amount distributed to the poorest club in the division, that amount then being have been multiplied by five to decide how much each club can spend - effectively putting clubs on an equal footing when it comes to transfer spending power.",
      "But clubs in the Premier League have elected not to push through that proposal. The previous approach with PSR allowed clubs to make losses of up to £105million over a three-year period.",
      "Nottingham Forest and Everton were previously charged and had points deducted under the old system. Both Man City and Leicester City currently have ongoing legal battles following respective charges. The previous rules will remain in place for the remainder of the current campaign.",
      "A statement from the Premier League on Friday read: \"At a Premier League Shareholders’ meeting today, clubs voted to introduce a new set of financial rules which will come into effect from the start of the 2026/27 season.",
      "\"Following extensive consultation, clubs agreed to bring in Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) and Sustainability and Systematic Resilience (SSR) proposals. There was insufficient support for a proposal on Top to Bottom Anchoring.",
      "\"SCR will regulate clubs’ on-pitch spending to 85 per cent of their football revenue and net profit/loss on player sales. Clubs will have a multi-year allowance of 30% that they can use to spend in excess of the 85 per cent. Utilising this allowance will incur a levy and once the allowance is exhausted, they will need to comply with 85% or face a sporting sanction.",
      "\"The new SCR rules are intended to promote opportunity for all clubs to aspire to greater success and brings the League’s financial system close to UEFA’s existing SCR rules which operate at a threshold of 70 per cent. The other key features of the League’s new system include transparent in-season monitoring and sanctions, protection against sporting underperformance, an ability to spend ahead of revenues, strengthened ability to invest off the pitch, and a reduction in complexity by focusing on football costs.",
      "\"The Sustainability and Systemic Resilience rules assess a club’s short, medium and long-term financial health through three tests – Working Capital Test, Liquidity Test and Positive Equity Test.\"",

That leaves him in an uneasy position of one more booking taking him to the five yellow-card threshold and seeing him handed a one-match automatic ban.",

      "The Premier League could introduce significant changes to the financial structure of the division during the latest shareholder meeting, with representatives from all 20 clubs set to vote on three key proposals on Friday. It has been 10 years since the league introduced financial measures, with the most recent model, profit and sustainability (PSR), drawing plenty of criticism.",
      "The current system allows Premier League clubs to make losses of up to £105million over a three-year period, though some clubs have found ways to get around this system. Others have been punished, such as Nottingham Forest's points deduction in 2024 or Everton's points deduction back in 2023.",
      "As a result, three new proposals have been made that could dramatically change the landscape of the Premier League, depending on how each club votes. The proposals made are called top-to-bottom anchoring (or merely anchoring for short), squad cost rules (SCR), and sustainability and system resilience (SSR).",
      "SCR is a system already in place for UEFA competitions, where a percentage of revenue can be spent on player expenses, while SSR is a rule in place to ensure that short-term and long-term financial commitments can be met. Anchoring is the final and most controversial of the bunch, however.",
      "Anchoring places a limit on how much a club can spend on wages - and amortisation from transfer fees - which is set based on the poorest club in the division. The amount is then five times how much is distributed to the poorest club in the division, putting a cap on the spending of all 20 clubs with the same limit.",
      "It essentially puts a wage cap of sorts on the division, only allowing for it to grow with the revenue gained by the Premier League as a whole. That has been met with support and scrutiny across the board, with potential for legal battles to take place if it is pushed through.",
      "Fourteen of the 20 clubs would need to vote in favour of these measures for them to go through, with some big decisions to be made on how it impacts each member and their own position. For that reason, there could well be some conflict as to whether anchoring in particular will be pushed through.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are thought to be against the proposal, with The Athletic reporting that Arsenal are also expected to vote against anchoring, but could vote for SCR if the prior proposal is voted down. The report adds that champions Liverpool; Aston Villa, Everton, Sunderland and Burnley are expected to give their support to all three proposals.",
      "The main argument from the bigger clubs in the division against anchoring is that it is an additional measure that caps their spending, on top of potential squad cost rules that they already adhere to in UEFA competitions. Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe made his view clear when speaking to Bloomberg about the proposals back in 2024.",
      "He said: \"(Anchoring) would inhibit the top clubs in the Premier League, and the last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG - that's absurd. And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.\"",
      "The Times reported that as many as eight Premier League clubs hold reservations over a change in the financial rules at Friday's shareholder meeting. With eight teams already expected to vote a certain way on anchoring, that leaves another 12 up in the air heading into the meeting.",
      "On the other side, SCR could impact the likes of Brentford, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace due to their current method of utilising the transfer market to generate revenue, which could hint at their viewpoint on the proposal, though it's unclear exactly how they will vote on all three, including the controversial anchoring proposal.",
      "It's just the latest challenge for the Premier League in dealing with the vast wealth it has generated from becoming one of the most-watched leagues in the world. Now it's put to the clubs as to which way they will go with the latest proposals.",
      "Friday's vote may bring clarity on the future of English football and the direction the top flight is going in, but it may also create further confusion over what is next.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has already analysed where Manchester United must improve ahead of their impending return to Premier League football. Currently on a five-match unbeaten streak, United host Everton on Monday with a win potentially placing them in the Champions League places.",
      "With a feel-good atmosphere surrounding Old Trafford for the first time since the Portuguese manager's arrival last November, he publicly revealed the issue that he must solve in order to prolong their positive run.",
      "Andre Onana has played just one game for United this season - their shock loss to Grimsby Town - before joining Trabzonspor on loan in September. With Senne Lammens impressing between the sticks, former United favourite Gordon Strachan believes the Cameroonian's Old Trafford career is all but over.",
      "The Scotsman told Esports News: \"I think Andre Onana has played his last game for Manchester United. At United you must have a presence in goal - whether it’s physical, attitude, or character, you have to be a presence. I don’t think he had that when he played for the club.",
      "\"A big problem for me is that I'm not sure Onana really wanted to be at Old Trafford. He looked like he’d rather be somewhere else and that might be what he needs to start enjoying his football again.",
      "\"At no point did I think he was enjoying playing football for United. I'd be shocked if I saw him play again for the club. I think his United career is over in that respect.\"",
      "Despite being on his longest unbeaten run since arriving in Manchester last year, Amorim still has a bone to pick with his team. A vibrant first half performance followed by an insipid showing in the next 45 minutes has been something of a theme for the Red Devils.",
      "Topsy-turvy games against Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur has led Amorim to believe his squad's mindset must improve when they are leading matches. After being asked why the drop-off in games exists, he told the Premier League: \"I think we lose intensity.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together.",
      "\"We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Nearing a year since his last Manchester United appearance, Marcus Rashford has looked like the player of old this season at Barcelona. With 15 goals and assists in 16 games across all competitions, the 28-year-old's form has seen him return to international duty with England.",
      "The forward racked up two more appearances for the Three Lions during the break, and it was Rashford who impressed Eberechi Eze the most as the Arsenal star revealed just how talented his compatriot is.",
      "During his appearance on the Beast Mode On podcast, Eze said: \"I’ve always known he’s a good player, but for that first camp, I remember going away like, ‘okay, this guy’s part of some other stuff.’",
      "\"The way he strikes the ball. The way he’s running with the ball, how he operates is. He’s an incredible, incredible player. And so, nah, I’ll be honest, I enjoy watching him.\"",

      "Ex-PSV Eindhoven midfielder Ibrahim Sangare had to be persuaded to return to the club's training ground after learning that boss Ruud van Nistelrooy had quit his position. The Manchester United legend took the reins at the Dutch outfit between July 2022 and May 2023.",
      "During that period, he guided them to a runners-up spot in the Eredivisie, while the side also claimed the Dutch Cup. Despite the triumph, the one-time Man Utd and Netherlands striker left his position after just one campaign following a disagreement with higher-ups at the club.",
      "While that decision, reportedly, pleased some members if the squad, others weren't quite so happy. Speaking immediately after van Nistelrooy's departure, ESPN journalist Milan von Dongen revealed Sangare's remarkable response.",
      "He said: \"They had to get him out of there to get him back. He was furious about van Nistelrooy's departure. So there will also be talk within the group of players.\"",
      "Shortly after, Sangare secured a transfer away from PSV. The Ivory Coast midfielder was sold to Premier League outfit Nottingham Forest. He's still a member of the Forest squad - and scored his first goal for the club in the 3-1 win over Leeds United before November's international break.",
      "Just over a year after departing PSV himself, van Nistelrooy returned to a coaching position with United, where he became Erik ten Hag's assistant. The dismissal of Ten Hag just over three months later resulted in the former striker overseeing four United fixtures on a temporary basis.",
      "United remained undefeated in those four encounters; grabbing wins against Leicester City (x2) and PAOK, and drawing with Chelsea. Despite that, Ruben Amorim chose not to retain van Nistelrooy within his backroom team, with him departing the club after the Portuguese manager's arrival.",
      "Van Nistelrooy didn't remain unemployed for long, taking charge at Leicester City just weeks afterwards. He was given the mission of keeping the club in the Premier League.",
      "But, in his 27 games at the helm, the Foxes secured just five victories and three draws. They finished the campaign in 18th place in the standings, with the Dutchman dismissed this summer.",
      "Following his exit, striker Odsonne Edouard - who was on loan with Leicester from Crystal Palace - criticised van Nistelrooy. The Frenchman failed to make any appearances under him.",
      "Speaking with L'Equipe, Edouard said: \"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Ruud van Nistelrooy. I didn't get along well with van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy has remained without a club since departing Leicester. He was linked with the FC Twente position back in September, but that role has since been taken up by John van den Brom.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire have been ruled out of Manchester United's game against Everton due to injury, but Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo could return to the squad.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and he said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",
      "In terms of other team news he added: \"Maguire is not ready, Kobbie did not train today, but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie, so we’ll see. Licha is coming close to be ready to play. Of course, we need to be careful with his first minutes, but he's clearly in a better position than two weeks ago.\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. He started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season before making his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month, but he has not scored since and Amorim has said it was a \"fact\" that he has \"struggled a little bit\".",
      "Martinez returned to full training earlier in the month, but United were reluctant to rush him back into action, so he was left out the squads against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "The defender joined up with Argentina's national team during the international break. Martinez did not partake in games and a member of United’s performance team supported him.",
      "Speaking about Martinez potentially playing in midfield, Amorim said: \"I can think a smart, intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions, but it is not the position for him. In an emergency, he can play.\"",
      "Mainoo was absent against Tottenham due to a knock picked up during training, but he could be available to face Everton on Monday night. Jack Fletcher was drafted into the squad against Spurs, and his inclusion continued United's 88-year record of featuring an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League this season. The midfielder's only start of the campaign came against Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the Carabao Cup second round.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window for the sake of regular minutes, but Amorim blocked the request and explained that Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Amorim has admitted United will \"struggle a little bit\" when they lose the trio, but explained during his press conference on Friday that talks will take place with the players' federations to keep them for as long as possible.",
      "\"I think it’s going to be more or less at the same time,\" said Amorim when asked whether Benjamin Sesko would return from his injury before United lose players to the AFCON. \"I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [to prepare for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back.",
      "\"We have the rules about when to release the players. We’ll see, we’re doing our job to keep the players a little longer. But it's not just in our hands, and we have to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and the national team.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify when the rules stated United would have to release the players, and said: \"I think it's two weeks before the start, so we'll try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "The United boss was asked whether the Wolves fixture on December 8 was an opportunity for other players to impress. \"Yeah, but we already knew [about players leaving], so it is a chance for other players. We need to also send a message. It is not ideal, they are so important in our squad,\" he said.",

      "Before the session got underway, Ruben Amorim organised a gauntlet which has become a staple of the training sessions. Among those to run it were Matthijs de Ligt, who started his first international game for the Netherlands since 2024 during the break, and Senne Lammens, who played for Belgium after an impressive start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "Once that team-building exercise was over it was time for the actual training session to begin. MEN Sport has taken a look at three things we noticed from the session ahead of the visit from Everton on Monday night.",
      "Three players missing",
      "Three players were notably absent from the training session this morning. Kobbie Mainoo did not travel to north London before the international break due to a knock and was missing again on Friday, albeit he could be involved in training on Saturday.",
      "There was greater concern over the two other absentees. Harry Maguire \"was not ready\" to take part in the session, with no timeline given for when he could eventually be featuring in training again.",

We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.\"",
      "Youngster involved again",

Amorim said pre-match that he didn't want to lose the remarkable 88-year record of having an academy graduate in the matchday squad but he was confident, if called upon, Fletcher could do a job.",
      "You can tell the youngster is comfortable around the first team players as he was spotted having a quick joke with Noussair Mazraoui during training.

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the clash with Everton on Monday night.",
      "Amorim addressed the injuries around Benjamin Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo. Sesko and Maguire are not expected to feature against Everton but Mainoo could return to training on Saturday ahead of the fixture.",
      "The United head coach was also quizzed on when his players who are heading to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) will be leaving the camp. Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui could all be joining up with their national teams next month.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim was asked to reflect on the changes he has witnessed over his first year in charge of the Reds. Monday will mark a year to the day since he stepped into the dugout for the first time in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town.",
      "Take a look at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below.",
      "That is all from the Amorim press conference. His full quotes from part one are below.",
      "It was everything going really fast. The first thinking was the environment was different in the Premier League and I was excited with that. Right away I knew that we would struggle with some things but there was a feeling that yes, it was the best league and best club in the world. But at the same time it was a big job and it is going to take a lot of work.",
      "We are showing that [improvements] but the important thing is that it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games we cannot forget that we still started in that point and suffered a lot last year and we have to take that into account. We have to play every game like it is the last one or the first one. But if you ask me, I expect a team with more control and more dominance, playing better football and the most important thing that we are more competitive in every way.",
      "He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis. He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.",
      "A smart intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions but it is not the right position for him. He needs more time to work there and he is not working there but in an emergency he can play, but I am not thinking about that. I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.",
      "In our league, the table doesn't matter because everything is so tight that it is irrelevant. If you know the history of our team you never know when it is a difficult game. So that [run of fixtures] is completely irrelevant in the Premier League.",
      "It is a concern but we already knew. There is an opportunity for other players. We have also the under-21s. We need to send a message in that time so we will see. But of course it is not ideal because they are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad but again, our academy is for these moments and they will be ready.",
      "We have rules when we have to release players, we will see. We are doing our job trying to maintain the players a little longer but it is not in our hands but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.",
      "I think they will leave two weeks before the start so we will try to get something with the federations but we will need to respect their wills in this case.",
      "Maguire is not ready, Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see.",
      "He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long but it is not that serious we have to be careful with him. He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.",
      "I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don't want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.",
      "Amorim is with us and the press conference is about to begin",
      "We are still waiting for the start of the press conference, stay tuned for further updates...",
      "Martinez looked comfortable during that training session earlier and it is expected he could play some role in the matchday squad on Monday. The big question is how easy he will find it to get back into the starting XI. Shaw has played excellently this season and while the Argentine will be eased back into regular football, there is no guarantee that he will eventually take the Englishman's spot.",
      "Amorim's press conference will be starting in just a few minutes...",
      "During the training session this morning, we have already mentioned that Sesko did not look to be involved with the rest of the squad. Two other absentees were Maguire and Mainoo. The centre-back came off injured against Spurs before the international break while Mainoo did not travel to north London due to a knock. We expect to hear why those two were not involved shortly...",
      "There is likely to be a slight delay to Amorim's press conference this afternoon. We should be hearing from the manager at shortly after the previously scheduled 1.30pm start. Stay tuned as we continue the build-up to the press conference.",
      "We are just half an hour away from Amorim's first press conference since the international break. Let us know what questions you hope he will address this afternoon in the comments section!",
      "A reminder that we will be hearing from Amorim this afternoon at 1.30pm. Ahead of then, here are the topics we expect to be covered during the press conference:",
      "United have just taken part in an open training session at Carrington and there appeared to be no Sesko with the first-team squad. Amorim will be providing an update on his fitness this afternoon at the press conference.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "To mark his first year in charge of United, Amorim sat down with the Premier League to reflect on the past 12 months. During the interview, he addressed the prospect of selling players to avoid potential PSR issues. And the Portuguese head coach hinted that academy players could be the ones leaving the club.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "We are expecting to receive an update on the fitness of Sesko during Amorim's press conference later. The Slovenian suffered a knee injury in the draw at Spurs and could not continue, leaving the Reds down to ten men for the final moments of the fixture. The centre-forward did not join up with his national team during the international break and there has been reports he could be out for a month. We understand that timeline is currently speculative but Amorim should shed more light on the matter today.",
      "United have confirmed they will officially open one of the largest safe standing sections in the Premier League when Everton make the trip to Old Trafford on Monday night. United installed 6,000 additional rail seats in the second tier of the Stretford End in September.

      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will be addressing the media this afternoon from Carrington for the first time since the draw at Tottenham earlier this month. That game continued the Reds' unbeaten run and left United just a point outside the top four. The focus will be on injuries ahead of the game with question marks surrounding the fitness of Sesko.",

      "Karim Adeyemi of Borussia Dortmund is a different attacker to be linked with an Old Trafford switch. There are also some reports of United showing an interest in teammate Serhou Guirassy, raising the possibility of a double deal.",
      "Versatile Ajax star Jorthy Mokio is the latest midfield option to appear of interest to those at United with the almost certainly more expensive trio of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson also wanted.",

      "The report also adds that Onana is also open to joining another Premier League club to keep his dream of playing in England alive.",
      "After Kobbie Mainoo was struck with an injury prior to Manchester United's clash with Tottenham, there was a danger that the 88-year record of having an academy graduate in the matchday squad could have been lost.",
      "However, Jack Fletcher was given the nod to travel for the match, featuring on the bench for the side in their 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "The United youngster is clearly highly rated, as he was spotted in training again today, before the side face off with Everton on Monday.",

      "They aren't alone, though, as Arsenal, Tottenham, and Everton have all been linked, too.",
      "It remains to be seen whether such a move could go through in the months ahead.",
      "Journalist David Ornstein has suggested that three of Manchester United's rivals may be in a better position to land Antoine Semenyo this January.",
      "United have been linked with a move for the Bournemouth star, who has a release clause worth £65m, but they could face a challenge in landing him.",
      "Ornstein said on the Athletic FC Podcast: \"Let’s see, it wouldn’t surprise you if others came into the mix, but certainly the industry is telling us so far that if there’s to be a move, it’s sounding more like a Liverpool, Man City, Tottenham direction of travel subject to change.”",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Benjamin Sesko is set for a spell on the sidelines after picking up an injury in Manchester United's draw with Tottenham.",

      "Caught Offside sources have claimed that Manchester United are confident they can sign Elliot Anderson for less than Nottingham Forest's current £100m valuation.",
      "They stated: “Financially, the situation is complex. Anderson is under contract with Forest until 2029, giving the club strong leverage. Internally, the club believes Anderson’s value could exceed £100 million if his development continues.",
      "“Still, Manchester United are confident that £60 million would be enough to tempt Forest into negotiations.”",

      "Manchester United can use the \"pure profit\" from a Kobbie Mainoo sale to boost their financial position amid a £1bn debt.",
      "Football finance expert Dr Dan Plumley told Football Insider: “I don’t think PSR will be their sole focus. I think it’d be a happy coincidence, if you will.",
      "“We saw this in the summer with PSR and Manchester United. We saw a lot of people were looking at the wrong company. It’s a company called Red Football, which is where the PSR calculation sits.",
      "“So despite the fact that we’ve seen they’ve had, well they’ve told us, they’ve had financial problems and plenty of media reports on that, the outlay that they spent in the summer, people were kind of scratching their heads, but they’re okay with PSR ultimately.",
      "“If this were to go through, I think PSR is probably not the sole driver. Of course, it does benefit Manchester United in that sense as well, because you can book that as pure profit and you can book it in the year that it occurs.“",
      "Sadio Mane has revealed that he was close to joining Manchester United, but former manager Louis Van Gaal did not convince him enough.",

      "“But at the time, me, I was not ready, I can say. I was young. I still needed someone to help me more. And one or two more years to become what I want to be. Because I was still in Southampton, I was not consistent. And then we said, ‘Okay, we’ll see.’”",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes Andre Onana won't be returing to Old Trafford once his loan-spell in Turkey is over.",

      "“A big problem for me is that I’m not sure Onana really wanted to be at Old Trafford. He looked like he’d rather be somewhere else and that might be what he needs to start enjoying his football again.",
      "“At no point did I think he was enjoying playing football for United. I’d be shocked if I saw him play again for the club. I think his United career is over in that respect.”",

      "Anka told the Talk of the Devils podcast: “The £65M release clause only works for the first 10 days of the January window. If anybody wants to activate it, Semenyo moves, the money is done quickly and that gives Bournemouth the rest of the window to get a deal done.",

      "Speaking to Snabbare, Yorke said:",
      "\"I think Amorim has got to invest in the young players and bring some fresh talent through to give a little bit of a chance if Sesko is out injured.",
      "\"If you’re gonna bring in a makeshift option as cover, we’ve seen United do that in the past and it hasn’t worked.",
      "\"It’s just too big of a club for bringing in a player that’s not the right fit to improve the team.",
      "\"I’d understand if they were flying on all cylinders to get someone else in there but when things are not going so great, it’s a difficult fit.",
      "\"If United are going to go and sign someone else, I think they have to go out there like Liverpool and bring in someone who would have a really big presence at the football club.",
      "\"Otherwise, the [development side is] there for a reason. What about Chido Obi?",
      "\"I know the first team squads are big but you’ve got to get these young players around the team for when situations like this happen.",

According to Diaro AS, Rashford did not attend training on Thursday for \"personal reasons\" after receiving permission from the La Liga giants, although it is reported that he will regroup with Hansi Flick's squad for preparations on Friday.",
      "The news that Rashford's absence isn't a cause for concern will be welcomed by Barcelona fans. The club are set to return to the fold to face Athletic Club at the Camp Nou on Saturday, with hopes of closing the three-point gap Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid currently hold on them at the peak of the La Liga standings.",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",

      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United do not meet a traditional big-six side across their next 10 Premier League matches in a huge boost to Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds will be feeling much better about themselves after a poor start to the campaign - which had seen head coach Amorim come under increasing pressure. United are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, though, and sit seventh in the top-flight table after 11 games.",
      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window went well, but heading towards January the Reds know there is work to be done as their squad still feels light in certain areas. Even with the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the Reds still feel short in attack. Sesko's injury has shown that to be the case.",
      "Should Sesko miss any upcoming games, United seem destined to play Cunha as the false nine with Mbeumo and one of Mason Mount or Amad behind him. But when Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON, United suddenly look very short. Ruben Amorim did hint after the Tottenham draw that he could delve into the January market, especially if Sesko's injury is serious.",
      "Even if Sesko doesn't miss a game for United it must be clear to Amorim that another forward addition is needed. Fortunately, the green light has just been given to repeat a trick United used in the summer.",
      "Lisandro Martinez's absence from the Manchester United first team has been painstakingly long. The Argentine suffered an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February and since then he has missed 35 United matches over 291 days.",
      "Much has changed for United since Martinez left the pitch at Old Trafford on a stretcher against the Eagles. Perhaps most notably, there is optimism that the club have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim. United are on a five-game unbeaten run and are good value for their position just a point outside the top four.",
      "Something else that has changed during Martinez's absence from the first-team squad is Casemiro's role in the team. The Brazilian has become an undroppable for Amorim having previously been written off by some.",
      "However, an impending problem will be concerning the Reds.",
      "Manchester United's chances of signing Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi have received a significant boost, with reports indicating the forward is actively planning his departure. The German sensation has been on the Reds' radar for some time as they look to enhance their attacking options under Ruben Amorim.",
      "While securing Adeyemi has proven elusive so far, the tide may be about to change with the January transfer window just around the corner - particularly as the 23-year-old appears set on leaving Dortmund. Bild reports that Adeyemi is eager to depart the club at the season's end, with contract renewal talks having hit a deadlock.",
      "However, Dortmund have reportedly slapped a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "Garnacho's future was cast into doubt at the end of last season following his comments about United's season which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League. The Argentine later secured a £40million move to Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea are understood to have offered Lavia as part of the deal for Garnacho at the time..",
      "The club were heavily linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba, though a move did not materialise due to his £100million price tag. The Daily Mail claims that it was Wilcox, who previously worked at Manchester City and Southampton, Lavia's two clubs before Chelsea, who asked about the 21-year-old's availability. However, United rejected the proposal due to fitness concerns.",
      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",

      "It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "Former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Paul Dickov has suggested that Danny Welbeck should think twice before leaving Brighton for a potential return to Manchester United. Welbeck, 34, has been linked with an unexpected move back to Old Trafford following his strong start to the season.",
      "The England international has netted six goals in just 11 top-flight appearances this campaign. He currently stands as the top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League, with Burnley's Jaidon Anthony trailing behind on four and several players, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, on three.",
      "Welbeck's impressive form has fuelled rumours that he could be in line for a surprise recall to the England squad for next summer's World Cup, especially given Thomas Tuchel's lack of clear alternatives to Harry Kane. In addition to this, Welbeck has been tipped to make a return to United in the January transfer window, nearly 12 years after he left the Reds to join Arsenal in a £16million deal."

The Slovenian hobbled off the pitch against Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, leaving the Reds with just ten men for the remainder of the game.",
      "The forward went straight down the tunnel and Ruben Amorim hinted he may have to delve into the transfer market if his injury is a long-term issue. Whether that is the case or not remains to be seen but Sesko was not seen taking part in training on Friday morning. Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo were also not seen in the training session.",
      "Since Sesko made his full United debut Amorim has either opted to start the Slovenian or play in a strikerless formation, with the latter choice opted for against Liverpool and Tottenham. The Reds could call on Joshua Zirkzee if Sesko is out but so far this season the Dutchman has only played 90 minutes over the course of five appearances.",
      "The more likely option would be for United to stick with the same system which they started with against Spurs. This would mean Amad possibly playing alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha leading the line as a false nine.",
      "Alternatively, Mason Mount could be given a recall to the starting line-up. He impressed when he came on against Tottenham and set up two chances for Sesko in that draw.",

      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "United announced the appointment of Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Ratcliffe discussed the importance of bringing in the \"right people\" and landed his prime target.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United confirmed that Sansoni would be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers in the summer window.",
      "In July, Sansoni said United had made \"meaningful progress\" with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\".",
      "He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re only just getting started.\"",
      "United's data-led review of 2024/2025 identified the attack as the priority area for strengthening, concluding the shortage of goals was the biggest factor in the team's underperformance.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens arrived in the second half of the summer transfer window. They were different signings to Cunha and Mbeumo, arriving with no Premier League experience, but the numbers were crunched on both players and United were happy to splash a combined £84.8million.",
      "The press release announcing Sesko's transfer noted that he had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.",
      "Jason Wilcox said: \"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at United.\"",
      "United sources pointed to Lammens' underlying statistics when he signed. They said the Belgium international had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe, with a post-shot expected goals of +14.5, and highlighted he had made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues.",
      "In layman's terms, post-shot expected goals look at how many goals more or less a goalkeeper has conceded than he's been expected to, based on the quality of shots they have faced. Lammens had essentially prevented 14 goals that an 'average' goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to stop.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.\"",
      "Sesko has scored just two goals since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but Ruben Amorim has backed him to succeed. On the other hand, Lammens has \"surprised\" Amorim with the extent of his impact.",
      "United's business in the summer window appears to be an improvement on previous years. How much the data is responsible for that is up for debate, but the club's data department, by all accounts, has improved. Sansoni has played a key role and he is currently recruiting staff.",
      "When Sansoni's appointment was communicated, United said further recruitment is planned for a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "Ratcliffe has been ruthless with his club-wide cuts. The employee count has been slashed significantly and every outgoing penny is now scrutinised, but the data department is not shrinking - it's growing.",
      "The United co-owner believes that investing in data can give United an edge, which will theoretically save millions of pounds in the long run. Just think how much has been wasted on transfer fees alone.",
      "United are in the process of hiring a data operations manager to join Sansoni's team to \"drive data and technology projects forward\". Sansoni has invited hopefuls who are passionate about data to get in touch.",
      "Sansoni is doing important work behind the scenes, impacting United's recruitment.",

      "United are five unbeaten, however, and have started to click into gear ahead of a reunion with former manager David Moyes.",
      "There are a few injury concerns in the United squad for Amorim to take note of, which could impact his game plan for taking on Everton.",
      "So, with that said, here's a roundup of the latest injury concerns and possible return dates...",
      "Benjamin Sesko is set for a spell on the sidelines after the star striker picked up an injury in the draw with Spurs before the international break.",
      "The Slovenian international struggled with a knee issue and was forced off late in the match, leaving United down to just ten men for the remainder of the game, while he wasn't involved for his nation over the most recent break.",
      "Amorim gave an update on the striker's condition when speaking to the press before the Everton game, and said: \"He is going to be a few weeks out. Not that serious we have to be careful. He is feeling better.\"",
      "It means there could be a return in time for the festive fixture schedule ahead, but he will miss the clash with the Toffees.",
      "Possible return date: December 2025.",
      "After making his way back into the starting line-up last time out, Harry Maguire's afternoon against Tottenham was cut short through a hamstring injury.",
      "The extent of the issue for the defender was unknown, with two weeks to recover over the international break potentially helping him get back towards full fitness, but not in time to face off with Everton.",
      "Amorim simply said: \"Maguire is not ready,\" when asked about the defender's injury.",
      "Possible return date: December 2025.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo missed out on United's trip to Tottenham through a knock he picked up just before the match.",
      "The issue was believed to be minor, meaning he is set to be available again for the clash with Everton at Old Trafford, despite missing out on training on Friday.",
      "On the midfielder, Amorim said: \"Kobbie didn't train today but we could see him tomorrow.\"",
      "Possible return date: Manchester United vs Everton - November 24.",
      "It's been a long road to recovery for Lisandro Martinez, who picked up an ACL injury back in February, but the defender is nearing a full return.",
      "The Argentinian international returned to full training just before the international break, though Amorim decided against throwing him straight back into action.",
      "While he wasn't called up to the squad, Martinez did join up with his Argentina teammates to train, in preparation for his return to action.",
      "On the possibility of him featuring against Everton, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing.\"",

      "United installed 6,000 additional rail seats in the second tier of the Stretford End in September. The work has now been completed and certified by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority for safe standing.",
      "The addition of the new section adds to existing safe standing areas in all four quadrants of the stadium, while it brings the number of rail seats to 13,577, 18 per cent of total capacity.",
      "The official capacity of Old Trafford following the latest installation of safe standing is 74,412.",
      "United said: \"Safe standing is recognised to improve fan safety while also enhancing atmosphere in areas of the ground where fans prefer to stand.",
      "\"The club has been gradually expanding safe standing since the first rail seats were installed in the north-east quadrant in 2021, with support from fan representatives and the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust.",
      "\"Fans with season tickets in the second tier of the Stretford End were surveyed before work began and this demonstrated strong support for safe standing in the section.\"",
      "United have worked with fans to improve the atmosphere at Old Trafford, opening lines of dialogue with supporters to permit dozens of flags and banners to be unfurled in the Stretford End.",
      "In August, the club sent an email to season ticket holders about their preferences for music around the game. United wanted to know if ‘Glory Glory Man United’ should be played immediately after a win.",
      "More than 50 per cent wanted the song to be played no matter what, while 24 per cent said they’d prefer no music after a defeat. The decision was made only to play 'Glory Glory' after a win.",
      "United began to play 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' by John Denver shortly before kick-off at Old Trafford at the beginning of last season. The track was released in 1971 and has been an anthem for fans for decades, but the decision to play it directly before kick-off has helped atmosphere.",

      "Just for once, Manchester United couldn't be criticised too much for how the summer transfer window played out. Considering the lack of Champions League football this season, it always seemed like it would be difficult to attract players to the club and, yet, they managed to address the major concerns.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were brought in to bolster an attack which stuttered badly last season. Senne Lammens was signed to improve the goalkeeping ranks and he has managed to do that well. The only area of the pitch seemingly neglected was midfield, but it was agreed that was further down the priority list at that juncture.",
      "It's only as the season has progressed though that United's attack has shown signs of needing further investment. Many assumed Joshua Zirkzee would have more involvement than he has considering Rasmus Hojlund left, but he does not seem to be trusted by Ruben Amorim.",
      "It has left United with a lack of options in the centre-forward role. Sesko is the only out-and-out No.9 in the first-team squad, but he is still adapting to the Premier League. Chido Obi is an option but, at 17, his short-term career plan is best served in the academy set-up.",
      "When Amorim wants to bring in a replacement for Sesko, the Reds currently have to adopt a striker-less system - which has worked against the likes of Liverpool - but isn't necessarily ideal for matches where a focal point up top is needed. That is why the availability of Antoine Semenyo should be appealing to the recruitment department.",
      "Semenyo fits the same mould as Mbeumo and Cunha. He's a player who has proven he can do it in the Premier League and has a goal-scoring record to match that.",
      "In a recent interview with Jason Wilcox, the United sporting director explained how the club made a decision to sign players in attack who they could 'plug in and play' in the Premier League. This does not mean signing players who solely fit the system, but also ones who know the division and can settle immediately.",
      "Were they to sign Semenyo, then he would be another player who could do just that. Another similarity between Mbeumo and the Bournemouth attacker is the concerns surrounding whether he can feature as a No.10, or centre-forward, considering he plays as a right winger for his club.",
      "However, speaking back in January, the Ghana international told the Reds exactly what they wanted to hear. \"I feel like I'm comfortable playing in any role across the forward positions,\" he said.",
      "\"This comes with the ability to use both feet, I think. I'm comfortable playing whether on the left, right or in the middle.",
      "\"However, in my head the end goal is to be a No.9. Maybe in the years to come when I've built the experience I'll eventually transition into that, but I'm not too hung up on that.\"",
      "If United are to spend a vast amount of money on a player, they need to know he can feature in a role suitable for Amorim's system. With those comments, Semenyo has offered reassurances that he can.",
      "It will be a huge surprise if Semenyo is still at Bournemouth by the end of the January transfer window. If he stays injury free, and continues the sort of form he has been showing so far, there will be Premier League clubs queuing up for him.",
      "Semenyo is understood to have a £65million release clause which will be active in the early stages of the January window. It's said it will expire shortly after the window opens to allow Bournemouth time to sign a replacement if necessary.",
      "As such, we can expect any potential suitors to swarm on him as soon as the window begins and United need to be ready for that. If Semenyo now proves to be a serious target for the Reds in the transfer market, Zirkzee will undoubtedly need to leave and we understand a request from the Dutchman is likely to be lodged in January if his game time doesn't increase.",
      "Should that happen, it's a no brainer for United. They must look to rake in as much as they can for Zirkzee and then use that money to attempt to sign Semenyo.",
      "He has told the Reds exactly what they needed to hear so now is the time to start planning their approach.",

      "A major new update in the regeneration plans for the area around Manchester United's Old Trafford football stadium has been announced.",
      "Lord Sebastian Coe, who won four Olympic medals and headed the successful bid for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, has already been named as chair designate of the Old Trafford Regeneration Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC), which will help drive forward the huge project.",
      "Karen Hirst has now been named as Project Director, working alongside Lord Coe. The chartered surveyor will lead delivery for the corporation.",
      "The establishment of the MDC has been approved by Trafford Council and Greater Manchester Combined Authority, following a recommendation by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. It will be legally formalised following Parliamentary approval.",
      "Most recently, Ms Hirst was managing director of Maple Grove Developments, overseeing major commercial projects in the North West, including industrial, logistics and town centre regeneration.",
      "She has also been a group board director of Eric Wright Group, and development director at both Salford City Council and Central Salford Regeneration Company, during her 35 years in property and development. Karen is also a non-executive director of Regenda Group.",
      "The MDC will co-ordinate multi-million-pound efforts to transform the area, as a key part of the Greater Manchester Strategy. Forthcoming housing development in Old Trafford has already been allocated a significant share of the newly-announced £1bn Good Growth Fund.",
      "The MDC is set to attract public and private sector investment to accelerate transformational regeneration, creating a world-class, sports-led visitor destination, rich in culture and entertainment. Ambitions are 'to make Old Trafford one of the best places in the UK to live, work, and visit', with up to 15,000 new homes, including affordable homes, as well as employment opportunities.",
      "Hirst will be responsible for delivering the strategic vision for the Old Trafford regeneration, developing and implementing a business plan to make it happen.",
      "\"I am excited to be taking on this new role and I am looking forward to working with Lord Coe, the teams at GMCA, Trafford Council, Manchester United FC and other key partners, stakeholders and local residents,\" she said.",
      "\"After working in both the private and public sector, I know that ambitious regeneration projects such as Old Trafford regeneration are challenging and will require many parties and people to make it a success.\"",
      "Lord Coe, meanwhile, praised her 'wealth of experience coupled with her passion and enthusiasm'.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium, Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",

      "Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana were among the highest-profile loan exits from the club, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho completed moves to Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",
      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",
      "Hugill started the first two games of the season for Barnet in League Two, but he picked up an injury and has been absent since.",
      "Defender Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign and notched a goal but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. The 20-year-old was not in the squad for Notts County played Harrogate Town last weekend.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Jackson started in their first two games of the season, but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back has been absent from their last five matchday squads.",
      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",
      "Rashford has been revitalised by leaving on loan - but Sancho continues to be in a slump. The winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Williams is performing well north of the border. Has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",

      "Zidane Iqbal is used to making history.",
      "The midfielder became the first British-born South Asian to represent Manchester United and the first to play in the Champions League. Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

Mount has sent a video message to Lewis Rimmer's wife, Sarah, and two daughters, Amelia and Maddison, in the aftermath of a Range Rover hitting him and causing 'life-changing' injuries.",
      "He remains 'critically ill' in hospital after being put in an induced coma, his close friend Andy Tonge has told the MEN. Tonge described the message as 'lovely' for the family. The Bolton News quotes him as saying: \"They're big Manchester United supporters, so this was lovely to receive, what a guy.\"",
      "Mount is said to have shared his condolences and expressed his sorrow at hearing what happened to Rimmer. He also relayed that \"everyone at Manchester United is thinking of them and sending all their love.\" A fundraiser set up by friends to raise money for the family has received over £100,000 in donations.",
      "Tonge has said: \"The incident seems to have really struck a chord with people. It happened during half term, and it’s shocked so many because it could so easily have been a child who might not have been as strong as Lewis is proving to be.",
      "\"Many feel that Lewis’ strength and fight over the last few weeks is nothing short of remarkable.",
      "\"The fact that it took place at a local supermarket, used by so many of us, has created an even stronger sense of, 'This could have happened to anyone of us.'\"",
      "Tonge added: \"Lewis, unfortunately, is still critically ill and remains in an induced coma, three weeks on. Sarah and the family have been by his side every single day, and the fundraiser has genuinely lifted them.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Earlier this month, Manchester United fans were left scratching their heads as one of their best players this season was snubbed again.",
      "Luke Shaw endured a tough start to the season, following on from a campaign ruined by injuries. The 2024/25 season did not go according to plan for anyone in red, but Shaw in particular was being doubted after another season spent mainly on the sidelines.",
      "However, full credit must go to Shaw for the manner in which he has bounced back.",
      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I wasn't here last time, I haven't started for a long time, so I'm delighted with today. The season is going well so far.",
      "\"I'm not sure if you call it a comeback season, but I'm feeling well, and it's going better with the club, and now I'm rewarded with a start, so that's great.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "READ: Premier League player power rankings: Haaland the best in the business, but where’s Salah?",
      "Asked when Sesko might return, Amorim added: “More or less at the same time [as Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leave for the Africa Cup of Nations], I don’t want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.”",
      "On negotiating to allow Mbeumo (Cameroon) and Amad (Ivory Coast) to stay longer before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty: “We have the rules when we will have to release the players. We are trying to have the players a bit longer, but we will see.",

      "Amorim said: “I can think a smart intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions, but it is not the position for him. In an emergency he can play. I feel Licha is coming close to being able to play. We need to be careful. He is clearly in a better position.”",
      "On whether Luke Shaw can play as a left wing-back, rather than as one of three centre-backs, Amorim continued: “He can play there, it is the load that a player does in that position it is a bit different. He is more prepared to do that. He is a smart player.”",
      "On how he feels after 12 months in the job at Man Utd, Amorim said: “The first thinking was the environment was really different in the Premier League and I was excited in that. Right away, I knew we would struggle in some things, but the feeling was it is the best league in the world, maybe the best club.”",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",

      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made a Manchester United transfer ‘reveal’ that you, dear reader, will simply fail to ever believe. There might be no point even trying.",
      "We’ve give you 20 Premier League stars at the top of their game. All we want is the club where it all started for them…",
      "The international break is almost over but the discourse over ‘preening, self-important manchild’ Jude Bellingham is not about to give up that easily.",
      "Arsenal went 22 months without anyone extending their contract until Mikel Arteta helped them become the one club who do not have any deals expiring in 2026.",
      "It would be quicker to name the players available to Arsenal and Spurs rather than those who are out or doubtful. Perhaps Newcastle could change the game…",
      "Set-pieces and long throws may be trendy but who really gets into football for those? We have the five best open-play Premier League goals of the season."

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "“What a spell he’s having in his career. You know, he goes from Manchester United, probably his club that he played for since a boy.",
      "“And then he was probably, I mean, surely they must have seen the talent that he had?",
      "“But I suspect he was sold because of the PSR rules and you get, you know, a bigger advantage because he’s a homegrown lad, which strikes me as absolutely wrong.”",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag did indeed blame the perverse PSR rules when asked why McTominay was sold.",
      "“Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",

      "He was a squad player; no more than a guy who was ‘good to have around’. He started just 18 Premier League games in his final season and in the two campaigns in which he was the first-choice option he was one half of McFred having been inextricably paired with another player deemed not good enough to be starting regularly for the club.",
      "Conte realised his talent immediately. Having operated as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot in over half of his appearances for his boyhood club, at Napoli he’s played as a No.8, No.10 and even on the wing to ensure he can make the difference in the final third, where he’s evidently at his best.",

      "Manchester United flop Andre Onana has been told his Old Trafford ‘career is over’ after leaving for Trabzonspor on loan in the summer.",
      "Onana joined United in a £44m move from Inter in the summer of 2023 and never truly settled with the Premier League giants despite making over 100 appearances.",
      "He was often the target of criticism thanks to a number of high-profile mistakes for the Red Devils, under both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "And he was left out of the Premier League XI for the opening three games of the season, with Altay Bayindir taking the gloves before young Belgian Senne Lammens took the No.1 spot following his £18m move from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Tranzonspor do not hold an option to sign Onana on a permanent transfer despite his fine form for the Turksish side and is due to return to Old Trafford next summer.",
      "But former United midfielder Gordon Strachan can’t see a way back for Onana following Lammens’ fine start in goal, but also doesn’t believe the Cameroon international will be too bothered about the need of his Old Trafford career as he “didn’t want to be there” anyway.",
      "“I think Andre Onana has played his last game for Manchester United,” the Scot told Esports News.",
      "“At United you must have a presence in goal – whether it’s physical, attitude, or character, you have to be a presence. I don’t think he had that when he played for the club.",
      "“A big problem for me is that I’m not sure Onana really wanted to be at Old Trafford. He looked like he’d rather be somewhere else and that might be what he needs to start enjoying his football again.",
      "“At no point did I think he was enjoying playing football for United. I’d be shocked if I saw him play again for the club. I think his United career is over in that respect.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Full Manchester United XI ‘banned’ as Liverpool transfer critics are silenced\n👉 Prem clubs ranked on AFCON impact: Arsenal advantage, Sunderland screwed\n👉 Former Prem star’s huge wages put Man Utd off as midfielder now has two options",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano understands that United will look to “find a solution” in the market for Onana when he returns.",
      "“In this case [with Onana], compared to Hojland and Rashford there is no buy option clause included in the deal,’ Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Onana will officially return to United at the beginning of the summer transfer window 2026, but my understanding is United are super with Senne Lammens.",
      "“In this moment I don’t think Onana will be part of Manchester United’s plans. Probably the idea would be to part ways, to find a solution for Onana, to explore the market.”",
      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Man Utd exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United squad was ‘relieved’ to see Andre Onana leave the club for one reason, according to a report."

      "",
      "Over at the Mirror, they are pretending the biggest story in football is that Jose Mourinho told Scotland to call up Scott McTominay, a story which first emerged over a year ago.",

      "And what is this ‘ban’? It’s a ‘prohibition on holidays during international breaks’, apparently. And it’s been in place for the last year (‘new rule’, our hairy arse) but now it’s apparently hot news that ‘Manchester United stars’ like Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi have all been ‘banned’ from jetting off abroad on holiday.",

      "Liverpool can sign Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January – but transfer critics miss point",
      "And what point are they/we missing exactly?",
      "Liverpool oversaw a record-breaking summer transfer window as they brought in 10 new faces, including eight senior players, as part of a £450m spending spree. They had never spent or signed more in a single window.",
      "Nobody had ever spent more in a single window, fella.",
      "Of course, such business came against the caveat of the Reds also banking roughly £200m from player sales as 10 members of Arne Slot’s Premier League title-winning squad moved on.",
      "Ten members? Really?",
      "Eight players who featured for even a single minute or more in the Premier League last season left Liverpool in the summer, and that included third-choice goalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros. Who are these other two? Tyler Morton because he sat on the bench a few times? Ben Gannon-Doak, who spent the season on loan at Middlesbrough?",
      "Is that really the point that ‘transfer critics’ miss?",
      "It seems the actual point that the ‘critics’ miss is that ‘both Semenyo and Guehi could be added to their ranks without the need to remove any senior players’ from their Premier League squad. Well that will surely silence all the ‘transfer critics’ who thought that spending over £400m in one window really should be enough.",

      "Whether by fans, managers, sporting directors, pundits, us journos or even themselves, these are the most overrated players at each Premier League club.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: William Saliba\nWe may be about to see just how good Saliba really is as superior centre-back partner Gabriel faces up to a couple of months on the sidelines, but also probably not because Christhian Mosquera or Piero Hincapie will be the perfectly capable replacements now charged with making the champion coat-tail rider look a whole lot better than he actually is.",
      "And if it’s not them successfully helping Saliba pull the wool over our eyes then it could be one of the dozen or so full-back-cum-centre-backs Mikel Arteta has to choose from. Facetiousness aside, Arsenal really should take £100m from Real Madrid. Any drop-off without Saliba, if indeed there was one, would be negligible.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nAlways be wary of a striker praised for “stretching defences” as the subtext is almost always that they’re a bit sh*t at putting the ball in the back of the net. Watkins is very, very good at stretching defences.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Justin Kluivert\nWe can’t quite believe he didn’t join Tottenham before experiencing what would be seen as a dip in form from the high of last season, but on the basis of his six previous seasons of senior football, is much more likely the mediocre standard we can continue to expect from Kluivert.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Jordan Henderson\nWe concede that Henderson has been better than we expected (and hoped) on his return to the Premier League. But perhaps clouded by our great lily-livered lefty dislike of a man who moved to Saudi Arabia having been such a supposedly staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, we don’t hold pointing, shouting and playing a couple of long balls in quite such high regard as those who worship at the altar of the midfielder with an entirely broken moral compass.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Carlos Baleba\nJust imagine the fun we would currently be having if Baleba was putting in these almost comically poor performances compared to last season for a Manchester United side that had panicked into his £100m transfer.",
      "The downturn could be down to his head being turned, but if he turned it a little more often he may not get caught in possession quite as much, amirite? Crikey Moses he’s no Moises [Caicedo].",
      "",
      "Burnley: Marcus Edwards\nAt one stage linked fairly heavily with a return to Tottenham or to Manchester United in one of the clearest examples of football clubs confusing ‘looking at who happens to be playing quite a lot for Sporting’ with actual scouting. Edwards has made three substitute appearances totalling 21 minutes this season.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Liam Delap\nAdmittedly a very small sample size thanks to the injury and absurd red card, but on a scale from useless lump to world-class striker he’s currently closer to Chris Sutton than Didier Drogba.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Eddie Nketiah\n“I’m astounded they let Nketiah join Palace,” Teddy Sheringham said in February. “I think he is a young Ian Wright.”",
      "Wright scored 113 Premier League goals in 213 games. Nketiah has scored 23 in 150.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jack Grealish\nWe were among those banging the Grealish for England drum, irked by his snub as the Premier League’s runaway assist leader with four by the time the September internationals rolled around. But two of those assists came against Wolves, and should thus be stricken from the record, and he hasn’t managed another in his seven games since, scoring just one goal.",
      "In the cold light of day, having put down our ‘We heart Jack’ placards, we’ve come to accept that England are probably better off with a bit of speed on the left wing and our ‘top lads’ agenda may be clouding our view with regard to him playing in a No.10 position he’s taken up roughly thrice in the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",
      "While one Hale End pin-up is now widely regarded as one of the best footballers on the planet, the other tends to watch Harry Wilson play football from the bench.",
      "",
      "Leeds: Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n58 goals in 248 Premier League games raises one big question: How has a striker who’s only scored 58 goals in 248 Premier League games played 248 Premier League games? Take out a two-season glut and he’s scored 25 goals in 163.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Florian Wirtz\nWe’re currently at the anger stage in the Premier League flop process, barraged by Wirtz advocates, mainly hailing from his homeland, insisting Gary Neville and his other critics will soon be eating their words.",
      "If it’s anything like the stages of grief, and we suspect it is as Bundesliga voices have already had great difficulty accepting the reality of the loss of Wirtz in that initial period of denial, we can expect Alexander Isak and others to be put forward as bigger flops in a bargaining bid, before depression and finally acceptance that a) Wirtz was hugely overrated, and b) the Premier League is indeed, without question, The Best League In The World.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nIt turns out a game against Wolves on the opening day of the season, after which Reijnders was hailed as Manchester City’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva in one neat little 82kg bundle, isn’t quite the harbinger of success many thought it was.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Senne Lammens\nWe very much enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek “are you Schmeichel in disguise?” chants from Manchester United fans as Lammens claimed simple crosses that his recent predecessors often contrived to make a mess of on his debut against Sunderland.",
      "But those tongues are now conspicuously absent from cheeks as genuine claims are being made about the 23-year-old being the undisputed answer to the Red Devils’ goalkeeping woes after literally five games of simple competency.",

      "Nottingham Forest: Omari Hutchinson\nWe wonder if the fourth manager Evangelos Marinakis picks to manage Forest this season might fancy the £37m club-record signing.",

      "Sunderland: Simon Adingra\nNot easy – they’re fourth, FFS – but of the 13 players Sunderland signed in the summer we were perhaps most excited by what Adingra might do having impressed in fits and starts at Brighton; it’s not really happened for him.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Lucas Paqueta\nWe are very intrigued by what might happen if Paqueta extricates himself from West Ham in 2026, as is suggested will be the case, because for every game in which he does something entirely out of keeping with the quality of the football club he currently plays for, there are half a dozen more where he looks as though he might have found his level.",

      "Wayne Rooney doesn’t immediately strike as the tinfoil hat-type, but it feels like the mere mention of QPR might at any point lead him off on a tangent which eventually ends in vehemence about how jet fuel doesn’t melt Taye Taiwo and Clint Hill.",
      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Ruben Amorim has made a Manchester United transfer ‘reveal’ that you, dear reader, will simply fail to ever believe. There might be no point even trying.",
      "We’ve give you 20 Premier League stars at the top of their game. All we want is the club where it all started for them…",
      "The international break is almost over but the discourse over ‘preening, self-important manchild’ Jude Bellingham is not about to give up that easily.",
      "Arsenal went 22 months without anyone extending their contract until Mikel Arteta helped them become the one club who do not have any deals expiring in 2026.",
      "It would be quicker to name the players available to Arsenal and Spurs rather than those who are out or doubtful. Perhaps Newcastle could change the game…"

      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him.",
      "United are known to want to improve their midfield in January. While Casemiro has turned around a period of inconsistency, he’s due to be out of contract in the summer, while Bruno Fernandes is being played in a deeper role than he’d like.",
      "Other options Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have struggled to convince Ruben Amorim they should be playing.",
      "Premier League stars such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are all being linked, but of late it has been suggested United don’t feel a move for any of them is likely in the winter.",
      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",
      "But there is a key issue in that his £410,000-per-week wages have put off top European clubs, with the suggestion that if a move to United or another interested club such as Newcastle is to happen, the midfielder will have to drop his demands.",
      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told Spurs they have “got to” land a former Premier League star on £410,000 per week, as a separate report has revealed his desire ...",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly identified former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves as their new ‘priority’ target in midfield ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’."

      "Fichajes reports the Brazilian is considering a change of scenery, as he’s aware remaining in Brazil could jeopardise his place with the national team, and United are linked.",
      "Neymar, having spent around a year out injured, has not represented Brazil since 2023, and having played for Al-Hilal and now Santos, is not at the level he once was.",
      "He’s scored three times in 16 Brazilian Serie A games this term and his contract is up at the end of the season, in December.",

      "“So an interesting situation to follow because Neymar could consider a move in the January transfer window. Now Neymar wants to be 100 per cent focused on his priority, so to help Santos avoid relegation and to do his best for his club.",
      "“In this moment Neymar is not having any advanced negotiation, but some calls have started to understand the situation of Neymar.",

      "“He’s trying to find his best condition, and so keep an eye on Neymar because he could be one of the names to watch for the January transfer window on a free transfer, and so that could be an interesting situation to follow.”",
      "Fichajes suggests a move to United is ‘viable’ but a lack of European competition – with global exposure said to be needed for Neymar to return to the fold with Brazil – is a drawback.",
      "But after three years away from an elite league, Neymar is in no position to be demanding anything of the sort, and United should steer well clear.",
      "They seem to have gotten themselves back into a good spot, challenging towards the top of the Premier League, and signing a past-it Neymar is not going to help them.",
      "Should he join and fail to have an impact – which is likely given he’s not played at a good level for years now – it may only breed discontent within the club, and they’ll have wasted a transfer trying to grant somebody his wish of returning to the Brazilian side.",
      "Further to that, they wouldn’t dream of signing a player with just three league goals in his last season were it anybody else, so signing Neymar would essentially be just for his name.",
      "It’s also a bad look for Neymar if he is to leave. After his emotional homecoming for the swansong of his career, to decide actually, these lot aren’t great and I’m better off going and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, perhaps isn’t the best call.",

      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",

      "There is said to be ‘lingering interest still there from Premier League clubs such as Manchester United, Newcastle, and Tottenham’ with claims that Amorim had been ‘really keen’ on Neves.",
      "However, his ‘considerable wage demands look like being an issue for him getting a Premier League move’  and the ‘overall feeling now is that they’ve moved on to other targets as a priority for that position’.",
      "Brus spoke to ‘one particularly trustworthy figure with ties to the agents industry’, who said: “There have been contacts between Premier League clubs and Neves’ representatives, but it’s not progressing – he earns £410,000 a week and that’s seen as too high. Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are the ones to watch now – they want a major midfield signing and Neves fits the bill.”",

      "Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have been linked with Arsenal and Manchester United respectively but they share one really quite obvious thing in common.",
      "Is it that they are breaking their silence? It might be…",
      "",
      "Perhaps it is ultimately on Mediawatch for seeing a headline of ‘How depleted Arsenal could line up in the derby against Tottenham after Mikel Arteta suffers crushing injury blow in defence’ atop the Daily Mirror website – after a genuinely brilliant and newsworthy round of international games, no less – and expecting a little more than ‘the same ten players and then one of a few eminently viable replacements for Gabriel’.",
      "But yeah, when the biggest story in all of football is apparently not Scott McBallon d’Orminay, Curacao forcing Steve McClaren to seek unemployment or Andy Robertson making everyone cry, and is instead ‘Arsenal might play the really good Cristhian Mosquera or £45m Piero Hincapie for a bit because one of their defenders is injured’, you do have to wonder what the point of this all is.",
      "",
      "It is also a bit weird to see scaremongering stories about how Gabriel could be sidelined until JANUARY (the Daily Mirror and Star both go all caps).",
      "That does incorporate a fairly large number of games in a condensed part of the fixture schedule so is certainly not ideal, but it is also late November so not sure the panicked shouting about JANUARY is really necessary.",
      "",
      "Actually, sticking with Arsenal…",
      "‘Arsenal discover true extent of major injury blow amid Liverpool title race’",
      "",
      "There is some better news for Arsenal in the form of this Daily Mirror website story:",
      "‘Antoine Semenyo has already hinted at transfer preference ahead of potential £65m move’",
      "And that is indeed Arsenal, who definitely have the need for a forward who can play across the frontline because Bukayo Saka, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Eberechi Eze, Kai Havertz, Mikel Merino, Ethan Nwaneri and Max Dowman really doesn’t cut it in terms of depth.",
      "Looking beyond boring specifics like whether Arsenal actually need to or can even spend £65m on another attacker, what precisely was this ‘hint’ that Semenyo himself dropped about his ‘transfer preference’?",
      "“I am an Arsenal fan.”",
      "Fair enough. Deal done.",
      "“I don’t conflict the two with my job.”",
      "Thankfully, and as we all know, footballers specifically only play for the team they supported growing up. So the deal is still on.",
      "“It is great to play against Arsenal, a team I have watched all my life and I want to play for the top clubs as well. In order for that to happen, I need to prove it.”",
      "Starting to sound a little less like a ‘hint’ and more like a really good footballer whose ‘transfer preference’ is just generally to reach the highest level possible and play for one of the unnamed ‘top clubs’. Because obviously.",
      "Semenyo was even asked specifically in that October 2024 Athletic interview whether joining Arsenal would be a “dream”, his response to which was simply: “Yeah, any team that plays Champions League, Europa (League) – that’s the aim.” So the idea that something said more than a year ago constitutes an Arsenal boost of any kind is nonsense.",
      "Breaking news: footballer’s transfer preference is to join a Champions League team. It’s also believed he might want a decent wage. More as we get it.",

      "Definitely a coincidence that Liverpool.com have happened to accidentally imply new information on an exciting story with the suggestion that Semenyo has ‘confirmed favourite team as Liverpool’. They’ll be awfully embarrassed when they realise their entirely innocent mistake.",
      "",
      "‘Joao Gomes has already sent clear message to Man United as transfer ambition emerges’ is one story on the Wolves midfielder in which, again, old quotes are used.",
      "You know what they say: a midfielder flaps his wings in the summer of 2022 and talks about how “playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream”, and that is apparently a ‘clear message to Man United’ in November 2025.",
      "You’d think a ‘clear message to Man United’ would actually reference Man United or at least talk about a competition they’re in, but no.",
      "It does reference Liverpool, however; Gomes called them “a team I would play for”. And the big, grown-up, mature MEN write that ‘while his support for rivals Liverpool might be hard for United fans to hear, football moves on quickly’.",
      "If there are Manchester United fans out there struggling to come to terms with the idea that a potential transfer target once talked up the idea of playing for Liverpool over three years ago, just know that there are people you can talk to and support networks to reach out to for help.",
      "Wait until they find out who Semenyo supports.",
      "But that is not all from Gomes. He has also ‘broken his silence on social media since emerging as a potential target for Manchester United’ to send a ‘clear ‘excited’ message’.",
      "His positively monastic ‘silence’ lasted about eight days, which might sound a lot but his most recent posts before then were on October 31, October 26 and October 9; the bloke is not exactly permanently online.",
      "And how did Gomes ‘break his silence’ in a ‘clear ‘excited’ message’ which is apparently relevant to Manchester United? By posting very specifically about Wolves and being ‘excited to do what no one believes, for us and for our city,’ in terms of helping them avoid relegation.",

      "Manchester United are highly unlikely to be drawn into the transfer chase for Antoine Semenyo in January after two top sources outlined where Ruben Amorim’s priorities lie and with the Red Devils putting all their energies into another target instead.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily into strengthening their attack this summer, spending well over £200m on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. And while the triple coup is starting to pay dividends, Manchester United could have added a different dimension to their attack had they instead opted to pursue Semenyo.",
      "Indeed, it has since emerged that United had a very serious interest in the 25-year-old Bournemouth star, with Amorim even meeting the player for dinner to discuss a prospective move.",
      "That’s according to transfer journalist, Duncan Castles, who claims Amorim met with the player to assess his personality and with the United boss ultimately informing club bosses he felt the player had what it takes to become a success at Old Trafford.",
      "That comes after David Ornstein had previously described the Portuguese as being “very fond” of the Bournemouth star.",
      "However, United’s unwillingness to pay more than £55m saw the deal collapse and ultimately saw the winger sign a new five-year deal with the Cherries.",
      "This week, though, it has emerged that Semenyo‘s deal contains a release clause worth just £60m, plus £5m in add-ons to prise him away from the Vitality Stadium and sparking something of a mad scramble for the Ghana international.",
      "And while sources have revealed it is Liverpool “ahead in the race”, the player continues to be linked with other sides, most notably Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd.",
      "Despite that, both The Athletic and our own, Fraser Fletcher, are playing down the prospects of United rekindling a move for Semenyo in January, with the former describing a potential move to Old Trafford as ‘difficult’.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, insists while United still very much admire the player, their priorities in the January window and beyond lie elsewhere, with the club’s entire focus now shifted on upgrading their midfield and with three major targets the priority over the next two to three transfer windows…",
      "READ MORE 🔴⚫ Ruthless Man Utd planning £250m TRIPLE signing, with Bruno Fernandes at risk in midfield rebuild – Sources",
      "According to Castles, Amorim met Semenyo for dinner in a London restaurant to discuss a potential move north over the summer and prior to the player inking his extension at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Castles told The Transfers Podcast: “They used the same strategy with Cunha and Mbeumo in that they agreed personal terms with Semenyo before attempting to agree a fee with Bournemouth.",
      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season so Amorim could judge his character – again a similar process to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "United’s prospects of signing Semenyo ultimately failed when he committed instead to the Cherries, though Castles also explains that United’s willingness to only pay the player 70% of the salaries offered to Mbeumo and Cunha also derailed the prospective deal.",
      "Furthermore, rival interest from Tottenham, coupled with United’s willingness to spend £62.5m to meet Cunha’s exit clause, meant the Cherries felt in a strong position to reject United’s approach and amid a suggestion they were not prepared to spend more than £55m on a player they rated at nearer the £70m bracket.",
      "While Semenyo was a player who ultimately slipped through their net, Castles is adamant he was a player they could have signed in addition to both Cunha and Mbeumo, if the price was right.",
      "And while the interest in the player remains, he is unlikely to be a priority for United, leaving his other suitors free to battle it out.",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has endorsed United’s pursuit of Elliot Anderson, but the Old Trafford legend wants Amorim to play the Nottingham Forest midfielder in a different role from what he is used to.",
      "On that new midfielder hunt, our transfer correspondent, Dean Jones, has revealed Crystal Palace’s stance around a mid-season sale of Adam Wharton, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "Elsewhere,  United have been confirmed as one of the clubs to have held talks with super-agent Jorge Mendes over a move to sign Borussia Dortmund attacker Karim Adeyemi next year, though sources have confirmed why the Germany star currently favours a move to Arsenal."

      "“Mbeumo on the other hand, I think he’s overperformed on what I thought he would produce in all honesty.",

      "Friday 21 November 2025 14:22, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",
      "The three tests are:",
      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",

      "Friday 21 November 2025 08:21, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and makes a case for Tottenham to win at Arsenal.",
      "There is a trend developing in Chelsea's matches against relegation threatened teams in that they are making very slow, stodgy starts in games. When assessing their last 11 Premier League matches against promoted teams or Wolves, they have only been winning at half-time on three of those occasions.",
      "Sometimes these trends have little substance but I think it makes sense here as Enzo Maresca is a notoriously control-focused manager who doesn't overly like taking risks even against the lesser teams. So that can lead to low scoring first halves - under Maresca, seven Premier League teams have scored more first half goals than Chelsea.",
      "Teams can also struggle to find their rhythm in the first fixture back after this break which is something that can be used to our advantage here to get against Chelsea in the first half.",
      "The half-time/full-time market looks a market to get involved with the Draw/Chelsea paying 7/2 with Sky Bet in a game where Chelsea should improve their attacking output as the game goes on.",
      "The betting guru derby always is a fixture with a nice edge as Tony Bloom and Matthew Benham's algorithms go at it.",
      "All the data shouts loud that Brighton are a top team waiting to happen in terms of their style of play but they are a team that come with risks when fancied by the market. They can struggle against low blocks and when enjoying the share of possession owing to a lack of killer instinct in the final third.",
      "In their last 21 games where they've enjoyed more possession than their opponents, they have won just four of those games. So if you are backing their opposition in these spots on the double chance you are making a very high return on investment based on the prices. Brentford, who have beaten Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle this season, in that market at 5/6 with Sky Bet are the obvious play here.",
      "When these two managers meet, history tells us: there's goals.",
      "Andoni Iraola has faced Nuno Espirito Santo four times and there's been 14 goals scored - that's an average of 3.5 goals per game and both teams to score has copped in each meeting.",
      "Iraola obviously knows how to exploit the transitional moments in Nuno's defensive setup but West Ham, who have scored six goals in their last three games and have found a winning formula, have the quality to punish mistakes.",
      "This should be another game where both sides push hard early on and leave nothing behind, which makes the 11/10 with Sky Bet on both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals a very appealing play to consider.",
      "If Fulham are to be dragged into a relegation scrap this season, there have to be worries about this team coping with the sustained stress and physical pressure that comes with fighting the drop.",
      "Marco Silva's men want rhythm, control and the ball zipping around in pretty triangles. What they don't want is a team who arrive, roll their sleeves up and ask them to defend the ugly stuff. And that's exactly what Sunderland will bring - just ask Arsenal.",
      "Dan Ballard, who scored against the Gunners and is 14/1 to score anytime here, looks seriously overpriced.",
      "Ballard has become Sunderland's biggest set piece threat: he times his runs superbly, attacks the ball like a centre-forward and doesn't need volume - just one clean delivery to cause panic. Against a Fulham defence that struggles to pick up powerful movers in the box, he should get that moment in what looks a great opportunity for Sunderland to bag another three points.",
      "Sean Dyche's teams are notoriously comfortable soaking up pressure. They don't always invite high-quality chances, but they will concede a lot of low-probability shots. In 28 Premier League matches playing away at either Liverpool, Manchester City or Arsenal, Dyche's teams have conceded 20.1 shots per 90.",
      "That tendency to soak it up plays right into Liverpool's hands: the Reds are more than happy to take lots of shots, even from distance or awkward positions. I'm fully expecting Arne Slot's men to dominate possession, apply sustained pressure and force plenty of attempts - even if Forest don't give up many clear-cut chances which may lead them to staying competitive in the game.",
      "This looks a great opportunity to back the overall Liverpool shots line of 20 or more at 5/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Football clubs love a reset button. New manager, new message, new mood music, new hope.",
      "But sometimes a reset is just a rebrand, not a rebirth - and Wolves hiring Rob Edwards feels dangerously close to a case of putting lipstick on a pig.",
      "Not because Edwards isn't a capable coach, far from it. His work at Luton, Forest Green and his early games at Middlesbrough showcase his ability. But this Wolves squad, in its current state, has deeper issues that stem from the hierarchy that changing the face in the dugout won't magically fix.",
      "Crystal Palace, by contrast, are a team who know who they are. Compact without the ball, efficient with it and blessed with final third quality who don't need 10 chances to make one count.",
      "They're physically stronger, better organised and operate with a clarity Wolves simply can't match at the moment. The away win at 19/20 with Sky Bet should land.",
      "When it comes to Eddie Howe vs Manchester City, the stats don't lie: Pep Guardiola has his number in a big way. Howe has never won in 18 Premier League meetings with City, losing 16 times.",
      "That kind of dominance from Guardiola's side is not just a quirk, it's a pattern that we can put lots of trust in when it comes to making betting decisions.",
      "Despite City's dominance in the head to heads, Howe is unlikely to change the way he sets his team in matches of this nature. He knows he's likely to be overrun, so instead he tries to limit the damage with a focus on being defensively secure. In big matches like this, Newcastle have shown they can be a bit cagey: they'll absorb, cut down the spaces and make it hard for City to feed Erling Haaland.",
      "This means backing a City victory alongside the under 3.5 goals line at 15/8 with Sky Bet rates as the smart way to boost the odds on an away win.",
      "The offside trap is back at Aston Villa.",
      "It's not just a quirk, not just a tactical flourish, it's become the heartbeat of the defensive identity under Unai Emery. And crucially, there's a genuine correlation between Villa getting that line right and Villa winning football matches.",
      "Whenever Villa's back four snap into line as one, they suffocate opponents. Attacks stall, runners misfire and dangerous moments dissolve into a raised flag and a reset.",
      "Villa are catching the opposition offside 4.5 times per game across their last 12 games. And, in the last seven Premier League games they've caught 28 players offside - the most of any team by 10.",
      "It's no-coincidence then they've managed to win five of their last six Premier League matches. And Leeds do like to commit bodies forward in direct fashion. That tactical philosophy is tailor-made for Emery's razor-precise trap to flourish once again.",
      "All roads lead to backing Aston Villa to win at 6/4 with Sky Bet. If the flags are flying, Villa should be too.",
      "Gabriel is the lynchpin of this Arsenal defence - their high line, their aerial insurance policy and their most physical presence in the back four. Without him, Arsenal may have a problem in the next few weeks if his abductor injury is as bad as early reports suggest. Starting here.",
      "Tottenham under Thomas Frank will enjoy this derby day assignment.",
      "Few managers in the league coach 'underdog football' as effectively as the former Brentford boss.",
      "Frank's Brentford side made a habit of punishing big teams. The smart money says he'll try to copy-paste that blueprint here: frustrate, pounce, exploit the absence of Arsenal's defensive enforcer from both open play and set pieces. Spurs have the quality to make a big move in the game - like they did away at Manchester City and in the Super Cup vs PSG.",
      "The betting is obviously trending towards Arsenal at 2/5 with Sky Bet but that doesn't fully account for the defensive reshuffle forced by Gabriel's absence. Arsenal can and still probably will win, of course, but Tottenham suddenly have a real foothold in the match-up, and the market doesn't quite reflect it.",
      "Tottenham double chance it is then at 2/1 with Sky Bet. And, the 7/1 on an away win needs a good look, too.",
      "Manchester United should come with a disclaimer: 'entertaining but structurally unstable.'",
      "Ruben Amorim has a team overflowing with attacking talent, energy and moments of genuine quality yet one that carries enough defensive looseness to turn every 90 minutes into a wild ride. There have been 37 goals in their Premier League games - working to an average of 3.36 per 90. No team averages higher.",
      "They are the must-watch team in the Premier League because of it.",
      "Amorim has realised that they are a team built for moments - not for consistency - and he's embracing it.",
      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games.",

      "Thursday 20 November 2025 15:12, UK",
      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",
      "Have Liverpool lost their physical edge? Last week we revealed the alarming numbers behind their out-of-possession drop-off.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
