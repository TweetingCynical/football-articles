      "Liverpool's £450million transfer outlay last summer has done little to interrupt Manchester United's top position when it comes to net spend for the past five years. Net spend - which is defined as \"transfer fees spent on acquiring players minus transfer fees received on moving players out\" - is a term that is routinely bandied about in football.",
      "The Red Devils are regular big spenders in the transfer window and routinely rank among the biggest recruiters in world football. However, their sizeable expenditure is rarely matched by profit earned from outgoings - quite the contrast from the current Premier League champions.",
      "It's closing in on 13 years since United last captured the Premier League crown but a five-year span beginning in the summer of 2021 has Ruben Amorim's side as the undisputed leader of the net spend table.",
      "Their total net spend has come to £-684.61million, which is just -£10m less than second-place Arsenal who've accrued a figure of £-675.77m. It's Chelsea up next with the Blues' net spend total coming in at £-662.04m, as despite spending over £1bn since Todd Boehly's arrival, they've earned huge transfer fees from outgoings in recent years",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are the next club up with their net spend total in the last five years totalling £-569.24m despite their last top four finish coming in the 2021/22 season. That was coincidentally their lowest net spend total across the five-year span.",
      "Rounding out the top five is Newcastle United with a total of £-430.61m - a figure that was certainly bolstered last summer by the British record £125m sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool. The Reds' position of sixth on this list with a £-426.77m net spend certainly calls to their cleverness when it comes to arrivals and outgoings.",
      "In their maiden Premier League title win in the 2019/20 season, Liverpool actually boasted a positive net spend of £29.14m that campaign, given Takumi Minamino's £7.25m signing in January was their biggest across the summer and winter windows.",
      "Their figure of £-228.6m this past summer tells a different story in what was their biggest transfer window ever, and by some distance. The club broke their record transfer twice, first with the £100m acquisition of Florian Wirtz and again a month later by signing Isak.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In the case of United's £-154.34m figure last summer - their second-highest total for five years - a majority of their transfer dealings were built around transforming their forward line. Almost £200m was spent on acquiring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Just when Ruben Amorim needed some comfort and solace, the Manchester United manager has been left reaching for his tin hat instead.",
      "Because Amorim won't get a warm welcome at Elland Road on Sunday. The Portuguese will get a red hot one instead, filled with the sort of poison and spite Sir Alex Ferguson could never quite understand.",
      "Unless Amorim has been living under a rock, he should be aware of the genuine hatred that exists between United and Leeds. Both might have 'United' in their names - but nothing could be further from the truth. This will be Amorim's first trip to Elland Road since taking charge of United - and nothing can quite prepare him for what lies in wait.",
      "Not least because he travels to Yorkshire at a time when Leeds are full of confidence as well as adrenaline, following a six game unbeaten run which incudes a home thumping of Chelsea and two draws with Liverpool, including a point from their midweek trip to Anfield.",
      "The game is kicking off at 12.30pm on Sunday for a reason. To limit the amount of time both sets of supporters have to indulge in alcohol. It has become the norm for West Yorkshire Police to cancel all leave and have extra officers patrolling the game. Senior figures from both clubs have been known to meet with police in the past to discuss security measures.",
      "While former United chief executive Ed Woodward once considered not attending a game at Elland Road, because he genuinely feared for his safety. If this isn't enough to leave Amorim bracing himself for a cauldron of hate, he should consider what Fergie once said about the rivalry between United and Leeds.",
      "Back in 2011, ahead of a Carling Cup game at Elland Road, a large group of Leeds fans congregated outside the United team hotel in the city centre. The atmosphere became so toxic, Fergie was scared to leave the building.",
      "And he reckoned the vitriol between both sets of supporters even exceeded the levels which existed between United and Liverpool. Fergie said: \"Historically, it has been there for a long time. I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects.",
      "\"Sometimes supporters can play a bad part in that particular game. But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never. It was frightening at our hotel. We had seven police vans round the hotel protecting the team. I don't know why it is like that. I don't understand it. But it is there and it is not nice.\"",
      "The hatred is historical, due to geography and the envy of supporters of different generations towards the respective clubs' successes. Leeds, who have no such rivalry with another Yorkshire club, dominated the 1970s while United ruled the roost in the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Leeds supporters have spent decades taunting United about the 1958 Munich air crash, while in more recent times United fans have goaded Leeds about the two fans who got murdered in Istanbul in 2000. Now Leeds are back in the Premier League, football's long-standing 'War of the Roses' will resume once again.",
      "And Amorim will head across the Pennines to find himself on the frontline of the kind of battle he has never come close to experiencing before.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After a tough 2-1 away defeat to Aston Villa in mid-December, Ruben Amorim's side looked to have turned the tide with a Boxing Day victory against Newcastle, which continued their impressive festive record. However, a 1-1 draw with bottom-placed Wolves – who picked up just their third point of the season in the draw at Old Trafford – derailed United's momentum.",
      "It's Leeds up next on Sunday, before a visit to Burnley and an FA Cup third round tie against Brighton. Then it's the small matter of back-to-back games against Manchester City and Arsenal as the Red Devils look to kick on up the table.",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that there aren't any plans for United to make changes in the January transfer window. The Portuguese boss spoke ahead of the Leeds showdown and admits his team are in a good place - but things can change quickly.",
      "Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation to have any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea - that is going to continue.",
      "\"We are near places of the Champions League but we are also near eight teams behind us.\"",
      "When asked if any current United player has requested to leave, the 40-year-old shut down the notion of any planned departures.",
      "He added: \"No, none of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is adamant he will be successful at Manchester United despite reports linking him to an Old Trafford exit. The academy star made an incredible start to his career at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag but his relationship with Amorim has not been the same.",
      "According to The Sun, the working relationship between Mainoo’s camp and Amorim was strained even before the midfielder’s half-brother wore a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ T-shirt at Old Trafford in December 2025.",
      "Despite this - and links to other clubs - Mainoo made something of a U-turn and is determined to revive his United career. Amorim has made it clear the 20-year-old is going nowhere, having blocked the chance of a loan move last summer and now confirmed that he doesn't plan on losing any of his squad in January.",
      "Mainoo will hope to gain important minutes upon his return from injury as England gear up for the World Cup in the summer. The midfielder may see a route to Thomas Tuchel's squad if he can somehow force his way into Amorim's plans during the second half of the season.",

      "Manchester United are 'exploring' a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. The Red Devils have maintained an interest in the 21-year-old since last summer.",
      "The £100million-rated Baleba's current Brighton deal runs until 2028 and has the option of a one-year extension. He is currently impressing for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.",
      "United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that the Reds' big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet. Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Baleba are targets, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen told his old club recently to make Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton their top target next summer. “I’m a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer,\" the Dutchman said via BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don’t think the move will be possible until next summer. He’s got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "“He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He’s great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "“His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It’s an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.”",
      "Meanwhile, Reds boss Amorim suggested on Friday afternoon that there will not be any major reinforcements this month. He said: “The transfer window is not going to change.",

      "Ruben Amorim will have some big decisions to make for his Manchester United starting lineup when they travel to Elland Road on Sunday. The Red Devils will be hoping to bounce back after dropping points against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves.",
      "Portuguese coach Amorim will have limited options to choose from for the trip to Yorkshire, however. United will take a depleted squad after Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries for the busiest period of the season.",
      "To compound matters, Amorim can still not choose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Noussair Mazraoui after they progressed to the last-16 at AFCON with Cameroon, Morocco and Ivory Coast. United's boss relented in his tactical rigidity to change formation for a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "A 1-1 draw against Wolves quickly dispelled any hint that Amorim would stick with a back four permanently. The 40-year-old may have it on his mind to swap back to the system when playing old rivals Leeds, however.",
      "United's boss has admitted he is short of options. \"You can see the squad, it is impossible and we cannot stretch the players that we don't have at the moment,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United could be in for a significant financial boost due to a clever clause included in Scott McTominay's transfer to Napoli. The Scottish midfielder bid farewell to his childhood club in the summer of 2024, joining the Italian heavyweights in a €30.5m (£25.7m) deal that brought his two-decade-long relationship with United to an end.",
      "The decision to sell McTominay raised eyebrows among fans given United's proud tradition of promoting academy graduates – but the move could prove profitable thanks to a sell-on clause included in the agreement.",
      "As part of the terms, 10 per cent of any future sale from Napoli will go directly back to United. This could result in a substantial payout as the 29-year-old continues to carve out a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, showcasing impressive form for both club and country.",
      "Last year, McTominay was crowned player of the season in Italy following a stellar debut campaign where he played a pivotal role in helping Antonio Conte's team secure the Serie A title. In total, Napoli's No.8 netted 13 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions, earning him a nomination for the esteemed Ballon d'Or award won by Ousmane Dembele.",
      "McTominay has also showcased his skills on the international stage with Scotland, a country he qualifies to represent through his father. In November, he scored a sensational overhead kick as Scotland triumphed over Denmark 4-2, securing the Tartan Army's place in the World Cup for the first time since 1998.",
      "Transfermarkt now values McTominay at approximately €45m (£40m), with two-and-a-half years left on his contract with Napoli. The Italian club currently ranks third in Serie A, trailing leaders Inter by just two points.",
      "A sale at that price would earn United an extra £4m due to their sell-on clause. However, this figure could potentially rise even further, with Napoli reportedly open to offers around £60m.",
      "There are even whispers of a shock return to Old Trafford. CaughtOffside reports that United are considering re-signing McTominay as manager Ruben Amorim seeks to strengthen his thin midfield options.",
      "The long-term futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are uncertain, while injuries to Mainoo and captain Fernandes have left United lacking in midfield.",
      "This shortage has forced Amorim to field 18 year old academy player Jack Fletcher for 45 minutes against Newcastle United on Boxing Day, and even deploy centre-back Lisandro Martinez in midfield during a match against Aston Villa. Other rumoured targets include Crystal Palace's standout player Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and former United player James Garner, who is currently with Everton.",

      "Sheffield Wednesday are in talks to keep Manchester United youngster Harry Amass at the club until the end of the season. The 18-year-old's spell with the struggling Championship club is currently set to end following the clash against QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday lunchtime.",
      "The on-loan star has been a shining light under difficult circumstances at Hillsborough. Amass has racked up 20 appearances for the Owls and barely missed a minute playing for boss Henrik Pedersen.",
      "The young star's impressive performances have ensured that more clubs have taken an interest in his situation, with Wednesday's initial deal with United only having days left to run. Stoke and Millwall have been named as two of 12 clubs who have expressed an interest in landing Amass in January.",
      "But the player has been very happy at Wednesday and United may decide not to disrupt his momentum mid-campaign. Wednesday boss Pedersen has confirmed that talks are underway for the Yorkshire club's November player of the month award winner. Communication is taking place between Wednesday, United and Amass' representative.",
      "\"There is a dialogue between the clubs and the agent, so I really hope that we can finalise something soon,\" Pedersen said on Friday. \"Of course, we would love to keep him.",
      "\"He has done really, really well. He's 18-years-old, played so many games, which level he has played [at]. Of course the young guy has a lot to learn, but how he has played for us, it has been great.\"",
      "The Owls are in a difficult position to undertake transfer business as they remain in administration and await a takeover. The club are in talks with the English Football League to establish what is possible in the coming weeks.",
      "Currently, Wednesday are anticipated to be restricted to free agents and loan deals that do not require a fee. The club are operating under a fee restriction ban and are not allowed to sign any players for a fee until the end of the 2027 winter transfer window.",
      "“I know there's a dialogue between the club and EFL now,” Pedersen “I hope that we get an answer very, very soon, and hopefully we can do some things so we can get some support to the players. At the minute there's a dialogue, but we need some clarity about what we can do.”",

      "Coleen Rooney stunned in a stripy bikini as she sipped a drink on the beach. It was only last year that Coleen finished as the runner-up on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!",
      "Wayne showed off his jet-ski skills while on holiday with his family. The 40-year-old seemed to be thoroughly enjoying his time away from the world of football punditry.",
      "Coleen was all smiles as she worked on her tan in Barbados. Temperatures on the Caribbean island typically reach the high 20s during January - a far cry from the sub-zero conditions currently gripping England.",
      "Rooney made the most of the winter sun as he relaxed by the water. The former United striker appeared to be holding a snus pouch while making his way back to the shore.",
      "Coleen showed off her beach body in a stylish bikini while embracing the New Year’s spirit. The mother of four looked relaxed as she enjoyed a drink on the sand alongside her family."

      "Ruben Amorim admits there are \"no conversations\" about potential arrivals at Manchester United in the January transfer window - and warned that the team need to look down as well as up over the coming weeks.",
      "The club spent in excess of £200million of new arrivals in the summer, bolstering their frontline by bringing in the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo. But there is unlikely to be any further new faces heading to Old Trafford during the New Year.",
      "There remain obvious holes in the squad. A new central midfielder was on their radar in the summer but they lacked the finances to pursue the likes of Carlos Baleba or Elliot Anderson. Wing-backs remain a vital part of Amorim's philosophy and he is yet to address that position.",
      "But the Portuguese head coach said on Boxing Day that sometimes he has \"another idea\" to director of football Jason Wilcox and the board when it comes to recruitment, but maintained that \"common ground\" must be found before a signing is made.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear hopeful of new players arriving during January and whilst there is optimism at United, who sit sixth, making a charge towards the top four, he is also wise to the teams below them.",
      "Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversations at this moment to have any change in the squad. There's a process, there's an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of the Champions League, but we are also near like eight teams behind us. So let's focus on the next game, just that. Our focus is to win the next game.\"",
      "Amorim has ruled out the possibility of Kobbie Mainoo leaving Manchester, which had been speculated. The midfielder had only start once this season with his standing not what it was under Erik ten Hag, when he was a regular in the middle of the pitch. Now he's often warming the bench.",
      "There was rumoured interest from Napoli but Amorim insists Mainoo is the future of the club. He said recently: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time.",
      "\"He played in different positions: he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game (a number 10 who drops into midfield). So, he's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling. He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",

      "Jamie Carragher has quipped that one of his hopes for 2026 is for Gary Neville to stop predicting Manchester United will finish in the top four - but he isn't holding out much hope.",
      "The ex-Liverpool defender has named several of his hopes for the upcoming year, which include another trophy for the Reds and success for his son, who is at Wigan, but also longed for Neville to stop with his constant United prediction.",
      "He told The Telegraph: \"Wigan Athletic to win promotion from League One into the Championship, Liverpool to win the Champions League, and for Gary Neville to stop predicting Manchester United are going to finish in the top four. At least two of those three have a chance of happening.\"",
      "United have missed out on the top four in three of the past four seasons. Their only success coming in Erik ten Hag's first year when the Red Devils finished third. Since then they have come eighth before ending last year in 15th - a record low in the Premier League era.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side began the year inconsistently but even in recent months Neville has reiterated his stance that United could sneak into the top four. That came after they'd beaten Liverpool at Anfield with the Merseyside outfit - and some of their rivals - enduring dips in form.",
      "He said: \"United should really be thinking that if they can get it right - Tottenham as well but it's tougher for tham with European games - they should be thinking around top four.

      "Kobbie Mainoo remains determined to make a success of his career at Manchester United despite a hugely challenging 13 months under Ruben Amorim which has seen him slip down the Old Trafford pecking order.",
      "The academy star burst onto the scene under Erik ten Hag and within a year of making his debut was playing for England in the final of the Euros. But since the Dutchman's axing his stock has fallen significantly with Amorim preferring other options. Mainoo has started in only 16 of Amorim’s 61 matches in charge of United and last made the starting XI when he played during the humiliating Carabao Cup Cup exit to League Two Grimsby in August - which will have done little to aid his cause for more involvement.",
      "The Sun reports that the working relationship between Mainoo’s camp and Amorim was strained even before the midfielder’s half-brother wore a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ T-shirt at Old Trafford during the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last month - which again won't have gone down well with the manager.",
      "Despite all that - and links to other clubs - those close to the 20-year-old United star insist he is determined to revive his Old Trafford career and fulfil his potential at the club where he's been since a child.",
      "United blocked Mainoo’s request to leave on loan in the summer and, despite talk resurfacing ahead of January, Amorim again made it clear that the midfielder would not be departing Old Trafford, even temporarily. Despite his lack of minutes the Portuguese head coach has maintained that he is the future of the club.",
      "Mainoo’s contract expires in 2027 but United have the option of an additional year - meaning there is no hope of the player's camp attempting to force a move away but using that to their advantage. That said, Mainoo declined United’s opening offer of a new contract at the start of 2025.",
      "The England international was only 17 when he signed his last deal in February 2023. Since then Mainoo has enjoyed huge highs - he played and scored in an FA Cup final and was crucial for England at the Euros.",
      "His lack of minutes is now counting against him. His hopes of going to a second major tournament with the Three Lions is in jeopardy with Thomas Tuchel currently unlikely to pick him for the World Cup in the summer.",

      "The January transfer window has opened and all 20 Premier League clubs will feel they have clear priorities. However, some may be more desperate than others to get deals done.",
      "Arsenal sit top of the pile at the halfway point in the season, but they and closest challengers Manchester City could both be busy. At the other end of the table, those battling against relegation may call on new faces to help their cause.",
      "In between, you have the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United. Both will arguably be disappointed by their current league standing, even if United are faring better than they were last season.",
      "Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the table midweek but Riccardo Calafiori and Declan Rice both missed the game through injury and defensive cover looks like being the highest priority. Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet could be a good option for the present and future, though there is likely to be competition from elsewhere in the league.",
      "Depth in attack could be the order of the day, especially if Villa are able to get out-of-favour loanee Harvey Elliott off the books. Newcastle forward William Osula could fit the bill, with earlier reports of a Frankfurt move for the Danish star dimming.",
      "Much will depend on whether Bournemouth cash in early on Antoine Semenyo but that looks more likely than not. Oscar Bobb would make sense, especially if the Norwegian drops further down the Manchester City pecking order with Semenyo moving to the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Central midfield could end up being a priority for Keith Andrews' Bees with Vitaly Janelt and Mathias Jensen both out of contract this summer. Quinten Timber, brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien, has been identified as a potential target to bring quality and high level experience after playing in the Champions League for Feyenoord.",
      "Brighton may in part find themselves seeking out a long-term successor to Carlos Baleba, with the expectation being that there will be renewed interest in the £100m-rated star in the summer. Boca Juniors star Milton Delgado, who reached the Under-20 World Cup final with his country earlier this year, would fit the Seagulls' tried-and-tested approach of buying young talents with high ceilings.",
      "Josh Cullen's season-ending ACL injury means a new midfielder could well be high on the Clarets' shopping list. If Liverpool are prepared to sanction a loan for Wataru Endo, the Japan star could suit Burnley's plan of loans rather than expensive gambles.",
      "Chelsea's first target is a new manager after Enzo Maresca's departure. Liam Rosenior looks to be the front-runner, with sales and loans perhaps a bigger priority when it comes to players.",
      "Palace's first deal is effectively done, with Brennan Johnson on his way from Spurs. A new centre-back could also be added, with an expectation that Marc Guehi leaves in the summer.",
      "A new striker is on Everton's radar, with Thierno Barry flattering to deceive since his summer move. Ivan Toney is expected to prove too expensive but Jorgen Strand Larsen has been mooted.",
      "Marco Silva is hopeful of adding depth to his Fulham squad, especially in attack. United States international Ricardo Pepi looks to have a chance of moving to West London, continuing the Cottagers' rich tradition of American stars.",
      "Leeds spent big in the summer but may feel they need one or two new faces to bolster the fight against relegation. Harry Wilson has been mentioned, and the Welshman is out of contract in the summer so Fulham may entertain bids despite his impressive form this term.",
      "A new centre-back looks important given Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury. Marc Guehi doesn't look likely to leave Crystal Palace until the summer but Liverpool may decide time is of the essence.",
      "An easy one here. Antoine Semenyo adds genuine Premier League quality to an already healthy front line and a £65m fee would feel like a snip if he makes the difference in the hunt for trophies.",
      "United are likely to make a marquee midfield signing in the summer but a cheaper January option is also possible. James Garner ticks the boxes in price and quality, as well as the less tangible 'knows the club' factor.",
      "A new midfielder would allow Newcastle to cash in on Joe Willock, with the former Arsenal man potentially allowed to leave in search of regular minutes. Kees Smit of AZ Alkmaar has been attracting Premier League interest and Newcastle looks to be the most likely destination.",
      "Forest are keen to strengthen down the left flank, while longer-term they may eventually need to replace Elliot Anderson if a big summer bid comes in. On the left, a reunion for manager Sean Dyche and Everton's Dwight McNeil makes sense if the Merseyside club sanction an exit.",
      "Sunderland were very active over the summer and are likely to be less so in January, but a winger could yet arrive despite Brennan Johnson opting against a move north. Paris FC's Ilan Kebbal has been mentioned after impressing in Ligue 1 with six goals and four assists in 16 appearances.",
      "With Johnson leaving, Spurs have money to spend and may well put it towards a new forward of their own. They looked at Man City's Savinho over the summer and could try again this month, but Cameroon star Karl Etta Eyong is another option with a greater immediate goal threat.",
      "A new striker is high on West Ham's radar, with suggestions they could even sign two frontmen after allowing Niclas Fullkrug to join AC Milan on loan. Lazio's Taty Castellanos has struggled with injury this term, hence his low goal tally, but the Argentine looks like an option for the struggling Hammers.",
      "With a miracle needed to avoid relegation, Wolves may need to look long-term. It's hard to see Jorgen Strand Larsen staying put too long, so a move for Sam Surridge - who scored 24 goals in MLS in 2025 - could help them prepare for a likely season in the second tier.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is relishing his loan spell at Barcelona but fresh doubts have arisen over whether the England international will remain at the club permanently. The 28-year-old has made it clear that he wishes to stay with the Catalan giants beyond this season.",
      "The United loanee has showcased his quality in Spain, scoring seven and registering 11 assists in 24 games. However, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo reports that Rashford is one of three Barcelona players facing an uncertain future at the Camp Nou.",
      "Rashford, alongside Robert Lewandowski and defender Andreas Christensen, is among a trio of stars whose Barcelona deals end in the summer. It is claimed that the United forward has had positive feedback from Barcelona but it is not yet a formality that his parent club will trigger his £26million buy clause.",
      "The Spanish club will reportedly attempt to lower the agreed fee, with Barcelona’s financial constraints well-publicised. It is added that Rashford could improve his pressing and defensive work.",

      "The January transfer window is officially open, and it could be another busy one for Manchester United. The Red Devils are in the market for a new midfielder, while the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee may be on their way out of Old Trafford.",
      "The winter window gives clubs the opportunity to improve their squads and kick on up the table. But sometimes managers are also caught out by injuries, surprise bids and loan recalls, causing them to dip into the market when they didn't necessarily plan to.",
      "United know more about this than some others. They were forced to get busy in January 2023 after Martin Dubravka was re-called by parent club Newcastle United.",
      "Dubravka penned a season-long deal in summer 2022 and was introduced to provide competition for David de Gea but made only two appearances under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Due to these limited minutes, Newcastle saw fit to re-call him just hours after the January window had opened, leaving United short.",
      "A United statement read: \"We would like to thank Martin for his contribution during his time with our club, and wish him all the best for the future.\"",
      "Signing a goalkeeper certainly wasn't part of the transfer plan that year, but it became a priority after Dubravka unexpectedly left the club.",
      "Five days later, United got Crystal Palace shot-stopper Jack Butland on board at Old Trafford on a short-term contract to provide cover. Once he returned to Palace, Butland would then sign for Scottish club Rangers, who he now plays for.",
      "In the summer of 2023, De Gea's own reign in between the sticks at United came to an end, having been at the club since 2011. The Red Devils then acquired the services of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Onana was introduced to serve as the number one goalkeeper but he has now been shipped out to Trabzonspor on loan, with Senne Lammens the main man. Bayindir now serves as his back-up, with Tom Heaton third-choice.",
      "Lammens has been solid in goal for United, who seem to have finally found their long-term successor to De Gea. He picked up the Player of the Match away in Tuesday night's 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Discussing Lammens' switch to Manchester from Royal Antwerp, the goalkeeper's agent claimed that United originally planned to keep Onana at the club to mentor Lammens.",
      "Speaking to Belgian outlet HBVL, Mark Volders said: \"Those critical voices... the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez.",
      "\"But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust. Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.\"",
      "United will hope they don't have to unexpectedly dive into the market this January, while there are eight names on a shortlist of midfielders who could arrive at Old Trafford this month.",

      "The New Year is upon us and that means it’s only a matter of months before the Premier League trophy will be hoisted into the air once again. The only mystery remains over the identity of the team who will be lifting it.",
      "As it stands, Arsenal are the favourites to be crowned come the end of the campaign. Mikel Arteta's side have enjoyed a brilliant start to the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Their dominant 4-1 win against Aston Villa has left them four clear at the top of the table. And should that be a position they keep until May, they will end a long wait that has seen them go over two decades without a league title.",
      "They do however have one issue and that’s Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s side have made winning the Premier League a habit. However, they could only earn a point in their first outing of 2026 after drawing 0-0 with Sunderland.",
      "Despite Champions League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup fixtures presenting the Gunners with a few distractions, they will no doubt be prioritising their Premier League title push. Their first fixture in 2026 sees them up against Bournemouth away from home.",
      "They then follow that up with a home game against Liverpool just a few days later. While Arne Slot’s side have not been at their imperious best this season, a clash against the reigning champions still presents a stern challenge.",
      "A trip to Nottingham Forest is then their next assignment nine days later, while a Sunday showdown with Manchester United at the Emirates comes towards the end of the month. Arsenal round off January with an away clash with a resurgent Leeds at Elland Road.",

      "A trip to Stamford Bridge would usually give Pep Guardiola’s side plenty to think about - and that is no doubt the same this weekend. But given the Blues are without a manager following the exit of Enzo Maresca, it could potentially be even more difficult.",
      "Their tricky run of fixtures continues with a home game against Brighton in midweek before City travel to Old Trafford midway through January for the latest instalment of the Manchester derby.",
      "A home game with rock bottom Wolves should give City an excellent opportunity for maximum points. The same could also be said of a trip to Spurs but given how many times the North London side have got the better of Guardiola and his team over recent years, it might not be as straightforward as some might be expecting.",

      "Manchester United have recalled midfielder Toby Collyer from his loan spell at West Brom to ease their injury woes.",
      "The 21-year-old made 12 appearances for the Baggies during his loan in the Championship, although just three of those were starts, with the midfielder him injured since the end of November. He's been edging towards a first-team return and could now provide cover for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo all missed the 1-1 draw against Wolves on Tuesday and the decision to bring Collyer back to Manchester may well be motivated by a desire to have more options.",
      "The midfielder made his debut for the club in August 2024 and made 13 appearances last season, but was the subject of critical comments from Amorim recently.",
      "The United boss has been called out for making little use of the academy but suggested several young talents, Collyer among them, were promoted to the first-team too early having played in the ill-fated Erik ten Hag era.",
      "\"He (Collyer) played (for United),\" Amorim said in December. \"He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation, what's happened.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Despite those comments Collyer is highly though of in Manchester, so much so that the club refused to consider him as part of any deal that could've seen the Red Devils sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton.",
      "There had been reports suggesting Collyer could be used as a sweetener to sign Baleba back in the summer. The youngster had progressed through Brighton's academy before leaving in 2022 and the Seagulls had been keen to bring him back to the south coast, where he is from.",
      "Collyer is regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country and United were surprised they had the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",
      "His stint at the Hawthorns failed to aid his development as the club and the player had expected and he will now continue his career at Carrington.",

      "Andy Cole has opened up about his feud with former Manchester United team-mate Teddy Sheringham. Despite their shared success at Old Trafford, the two strikers were known for their frosty relationship.",
      "Cole, who moved to Manchester from Newcastle after a record-breaking season, was instrumental in United's 1999 treble-winning campaign and helped secure five Premier League titles.",
      "However, his relationship with Sheringham was marked by tension and animosity. Now, the 54-year-old has revisited the roots of their dispute, offering fresh insight into this well-documented rivalry, including the three incidents that led to their silence.",
      "\"It started when I was playing for England,\" Cole said on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"I was going to make my England debut.",
      "\"He [Sheringham] was he was coming off and he just snubbed me on the line. So straight away, my head just falls off. I remember growing up as a kid watching England, whoever made their debut, anyone who came off for them would always make a big beeline for that person coming on.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"Debuts are supposed to mean a hell of a lot to whoever it is, whatever respective country you're going to play for. To know that I didn't get someone respecting me on my debut, it was just playing with my head straight away.\"",
      "Sheringham's arrival at Old Trafford in 1997 saw the pair's relationship deteriorate further. Cole recalled: \"When he joined Man United, I remember sitting there and saying to myself, 'Oh my gosh, problems, problems.'",
      "\"So I've walked in on the first day and I've gone to the dressing room and the boys are absolutely hammering me. Calling us best mates and everything like that. Then pre-season, it was in Milan or somewhere like that and he said something to me. I'm like, 'Do you know how long I've been at Man United now? I mean, I think I know how to play.'",
      "\"That kind of set the time bomb off. Then we played Bolton and it ended 1-1. He said the Bolton goal was my fault. I lost it. Proper lost it. I'm usually the last person off the pitch. I don't rush down the tunnel or anything like that. But I remember then I was the first one down the tunnel.",
      "\"I ran to the dressing room and I'm waiting for him to come in. Then it goes off in the dressing room and then the manager pulls me in. He said, 'This can't go on. I know you two don't get on, but I can't condone that in the dressing room.'",
      "ANDY COLE EPISODE ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Watch All Out Football's episode with Andy Cole here.",
      "\"I heard that and so that was it for his duration at Manchester United and my duration at Manchester United. I never had another conversation with Sheringham.\"",
      "Yet Sheringham maintains the duo have since buried the hatchet. A chance encounter at a nightclub in 2019 saw Cole extend an olive branch to Sheringham, with the two now on cordial terms.",

      "Manchester United won't be seeing their Africa Cup of Nations trio any time soon - but Ruben Amorim can at least take heart from the fact they are being managed carefully while on international duty.",
      "United have been seriously depleted in recent matches, with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui away at AFCON, while Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries. It has coincided with the busiest period of the season, forcing Amorim to adapt.",
      "Those adaptions were going well when a much-changed side held on to record a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. But a 1-1 draw against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves, quickly dispelled any hint of optimism, potentially sending Amorim back to the drawing board.",
      "United were pretty uninspired in attack against Wolves and needed a fluky deflected effort from Joshua Zirkzee to find the back of the net. How the Portuguese boss must have wished he could call upon Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "He therefore won't have been delighted to see that Morocco, Cameroon and Ivory Coast all made it out of the group stages at AFCON. Mazraoui, Mbeumo and Amad are now looking forward to knockout matches in Morocco, rather than United's game against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Cameroon came from 1-0 down to beat Mozambique 2-1 on New Year's Eve, while defending champions Ivory Coast also mounted a comeback to beat Gabon 3-2 and top Group F. The results mean that Cameroon will play South Africa in the last 16, while Ivory Coast will face Burkina Faso. Morocco had already booked their knockout match against Tanzania on Sunday.",
      "Mid-season tournaments are always a tricky thing to negotiate for club managers, who wish their players well but ultimately have selfish motives. They want them back as quickly as possible and without any injuries.",
      "So Amorim will have been pleased to see Mbeumo taken off at half-time in Cameroon's win against Mozambique - not because of an injury, but to manage his minutes. Amad, meanwhile, started Ivory Coast's game on the bench and came on as a 76th-minute substitute.",
      "Morocco and Cameroon play their last 16 games on Sunday - the same day United travel to Elland Road to face Leeds - while Ivory Coast are next in action on Tuesday. It means that, in theory, if their national sides lose, Mazraoui and Mbeumo could be back with United in time for their trip to Turf Moor to play Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.",
      "Amad, however, wouldn't be back until the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton on Sunday, January 11, at the earliest, if Ivory Coast are beaten by Burkina Faso.",
      "Amorim will therefore have to continue to put his faith in United's academy players, who have been given rare opportunities to play first-team minutes. Jack Fletcher and Bendito Mantato came off the bench against Wolves, while Tyler Fredricson got minutes in the win over Newcastle.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson warned against clubs using the January transfer window to find a quick fix. Manchester United have been linked with several deals in the New Year, but the legendary manager advised teams to avoid big-money moves during the winter window.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side are chasing a return to Champions League football but currently sit two points off fourth-placed Liverpool, who could extend the gap with a win over Leeds on Thursday night. Though there have been signs of improvement across the campaign, United’s recent stalemate with Wolves reminded fans of their team’s shortcomings.",
      "The transfer window offers Amorim an opportunity to strengthen his squad, both in the short and long term. However, Ferguson previously explained why he believed making major signings in January was not worth the risk.",
      "In 2012, Ferguson stated that no marquee January signing had ever been an instant success. \"I've never seen it work, a player come in January, sign for big money and settle before the start of next season,” the United boss told The Independent.",
      "He added: \"To go into the market in January you never get full value, people think you're desperate so ask for more.\"",
      "Ferguson largely stuck to his own advice throughout his tenure, despite two of his best-ever signings both arriving in January 2006. Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra cost a combined £12.5million from their respective clubs but did not immediately establish themselves as stars, taking time to settle in at Old Trafford.",
      "While the success rate of major January signings is mixed, there are notable exceptions, including United skipper Bruno Fernandes. Focusing on the current transfer window, United are claimed to have assembled an eight-man shortlist of centre midfielders to bolster Amorim’s team.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Nottingham Forest ’s Elliot Anderson is top of the club’s wishlist, though a deal is unlikely as his team continue to battle relegation. Brighton’s highly-rated Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton were both heavily linked with United in the summer.",
      "England international Conor Gallagher has previously been touted with swapping Atletico Madrid for Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Everton’s James Garner has also been linked with a return to his boyhood club.",
      "Other options mentioned in the report are Bournemouth's Tyler Adams, Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes and Portugal international Ruben Neves, who currently plays for Al-Hilal. Whether United opt to spend big in January remains to be seen but Amorim has been short of midfield options in recent weeks.",
      "Injuries to Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo saw United start with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte in midfield against Wolves, with youngster Jack Fletcher being introduced at half-time. Ferguson would support Amorim utilising the club’s academy talent to solve the club’s midfield issue, rather than seeking an expensive solution in January.",
      "One of the only exceptions Ferguson made during his reign was to sign Louis Saha from Fulham in early 2004, who instantly began repaying his £12.85m fee with seven goals in 14 games. Experienced striker Henrik Larsson was also brought in on a short-term loan as Ferguson sought an immediate boost in 2007. However, the vast majority of his January dealings focused on long-term prospects.",
      "Wilfried Zaha became the last signing of the Ferguson era when he completed his £10m move from Crystal Palace in January 2013. Viewed as a player for the future, he was loaned back to Palace. In the following campaign, Zaha made just four appearances during his sole season at United before rejoining Palace permanently that summer.",

      "The January transfer window is shaping up to be an intriguing one for Manchester United. Over the past weeks and months, several high-profile stars have been linked with moves to the Theatre of Dreams, while a number of established squad members look to be nearing the exit door.",
      "Historically, United's mid-season transfers have been hit and miss. For every game-changing arrival like Nemanja Vidic or Bruno Fernandes, there has been an Alexis Sanchez or a Dong Fangzhuo.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad will aim to carry their relatively strong end-of-2025 momentum into the New Year and start the campaign strongly, as the club pursues its first top-four finish in three seasons. Navigating the January window successfully could be crucial - not just for turning United's season into a memorable one, but also in cementing Amorim's long-term position at the club.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has been in sensational form at Bournemouth this season, attracting serious interest from United as a potential solution to their lack of width and firepower up top. His ability to take on defenders and finish clinically has boosted his profile significantly in recent months, with a release clause making him an appealing mid-season target.",
      "However, United seem to have slipped behind in the race, with rivals Manchester City closing in on his signature. Reports suggest a deal at the Etihad Stadium could be completed this week, meaning United supporters might see the Ghanaian in blue rather than red this winter.",
      "Crystal Palace's midfielder has become one of the Premier League's most wanted deep-lying playmakers due to his outstanding passing and calmness under pressure. Amorim reportedly sees him as the perfect 'metronome' to control the tempo of his 3-4-3 system and facilitate transitions from the defensive third.",
      "Signing Wharton will not be cheap, with Palace expected to demand at least £70million for their star - and possibly much more to sanction a mid-season transfer. While United's interest is genuine, a January deal is considered difficult, as the Eagles aim to retain their squad until summer.",
      "Carlos Baleba has impressed United scouts as a high-energy, all-action midfielder capable of rejuvenating the current squad. His capacity to break up play and surge forward with the ball fits perfectly with the high-pressing requirements of modern United football.",
      "Brighton are known as tough negotiators and are likely to insist on a fee close to £100m given his long-term promise, as they did in the summer. While United are said to be eager to secure the Cameroonian, Brighton's valuation may make a move this month unlikely.",
      "After a breakthrough season at Nottingham Forest, Elliot Anderson has become a top midfield target for several leading clubs. His technical skill in tight areas and tireless work rate make him stand out in both the Premier League and Thomas Tuchel's England squad.",
      "Forest are reportedly seeking at least £100m for the former Newcastle United player and are unlikely to consider a mid-season sale. Coupled with strong interest from Manchester City and Chelsea, a January move appears highly challenging.",
      "Stuttgart's playmaker has been identified as a refined alternative for United's midfield, offering exceptional football intelligence and advanced ball progression. Excelling in the Bundesliga and for Germany, he is viewed as ready to step straight into a top European club.",
      "Stiller reportedly has a release clause around £34million, effective in 2026. United could see him as a cost-efficient option compared with other targets - a consideration made even more relevant given injuries and possible departures in their midfield.",
      "In what would be both a sentimental and strategic acquisition, United are reportedly exploring a return for former academy graduate James Garner from Everton to strengthen squad depth. Garner has developed into a dependable Premier League performer, whose energy and tactical awareness would offer a low-risk midfield solution.",
      "Garner's contract runs until the end of the season, allowing the Red Devils to potentially secure him at a reduced cost if Everton are unwilling to lose him for free in the summer.",
      "Ex-Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher has struggled for playing time at Atletico Madrid this season and is reportedly eager to return to England to secure a spot in the 2026 World Cup squad. United value his 'engine' and Premier League experience, seeing him as an immediate boost to midfield intensity.",
      "Atletico are understood to be willing to consider a sale at around £30m, though United may be able to negotiate a lower price given Gallagher's limited appearances this term. It may not be a headline-grabbing move, but Gallagher could be a clever addition for a United side short on energy and depth in central midfield.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt wing-back Nathaniel Brown has come onto United's radar as a solution for their ongoing left-sided issues. His pace and ability to offer width in a back-five make him a highly tactical fit for Amorim's system.",
      "As an emerging Bundesliga talent, the 22-year-old could cost around £50m, representing a high-risk option given his lack of top-level experience. Still, with United in need of elite wing-backs, Brown could be a gamble worth pursuing.",
      "Although hailed as one of United's brightest prospects in 2024, Kobbie Mainoo has dropped out of Amorim's first-team plans and is expected to leave in January. The midfielder wants regular playing time, especially with the World Cup approaching, and is reportedly pushing for a loan.",
      "Several top European clubs are monitoring his situation should a temporary move be approved. However, with United short in midfield, the club are hesitant to allow him to leave without first finding a replacement. A loan appears likely, but an incoming signing may need to come first.",
      "Following a difficult spell on the sidelines and limited first-team opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is widely expected to depart this winter to restart his career.",
      "With his contract expiring in summer, United are keen to sell rather than lose him for free - and are reportedly open to bids as low as £3m for the Dutchman.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has struggled to replicate the goal-scoring form that prompted his move from Bologna. Reports indicate AS Roma have made a formal loan proposal with an obligation to buy, as the striker is keen to return to Serie A.",
      "United are reviewing the offer but may wait until a replacement is secured before approving the move. This transfer looks highly likely, with all parties aligned on a fresh start.",
      "Despite his recent arrival, speculation suggests Ugarte may not fit the specific midfield style Amorim wants. While still a top-class ball-winner, interest from other European clubs has raised questions over his long-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "United are open to selling, but only for the right fee. Turkish giants Galatasaray are among the interested clubs and are reportedly preparing a loan-plus-option-to-buy bid this month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Welcome along to our latest Manchester United question and answer session with senior club writer Tyrone Marshall, who covers the daily goings-on at Old Trafford.",
      "The January transfer window is now open and United could be active this month. Joshua Zirkzee is wanted by Roma and Kobbie Mainoo could push for a loan move, which would lead to replacements coming in.",
      "On the pitch, Ruben Amorim is in need of a New Year pick-me-up after ending 2025 with a dismal draw at home to Wolves.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "Will the club make any short-term loans to plug gaps? Like a Conor Gallagher or Ivan Toney?",
      "It's a possibility. United insist the focus is on long-term targets and anything they do will be to bring forward a move they had planned to make further down the line.",
      "I don't think Toney fits that bill, although I do think he would have been a good signing had United made their move when he left Brentford, rather than now. There is faith in Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford and any attacking signing is likely to replace Zirkzee as more of a back-up, and Toney isn't going to play that role.",
      "Midfield is an area United will monitor this month. They expect to start an overhaul of the midfield in the summer but could bring that forward if possible. It might well depend on whether anyone leaves. Manuel Ugarte's future is uncertain and Mainoo could yet look to push for a loan this month if his situation doesn't improve.",
      "Do they have the PSR room to make a big move for a Adam Wharton or another young CM, maybe from abroad like Sangare from Lens?",
      "United's PSR position has improved, as witnessed by their summer spending and the willingness to be in the running for £65million Antoine Semenyo this month. The PSR rules are also on their way, to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) next season. Those rules should, in theory, better suit United.",
      "I don't think there is any chance Palace let Wharton go this month. Look at the fuss Oliver Glasner kicked up when they almost sold Marc Guehi in the summer, it isn't going to happen, especially when they are in the running for European football again.",
      "Someone like Sangare would probably be more achievable, although there is nothing concrete there at the moment. Again, something like that may depend on the futures of Ugarte and Mainoo this month.",
      "Get Kobbie fit and playing. How come a first-choice England international of last year can't get a place in our current \"star-studded\" team, who are playing such sensational football and sweeping aside teams week in week out?",
      "It's been a difficult 12 months for Mainoo. It seems pretty clear that Amorim isn't convinced, although he isn't the only one. Mainoo is an exceptional midfielder in possession but his out-of-possession work needs a lot of improvement. That is why there is a reluctance to play him too deep and why Amorim trialled him as a No.10 and even a striker last year.",
      "His quick feet and dribbling make him a real threat in those areas. If he can sharpen up with his positioning in deeper areas he can develop into a quality midfielder, but to do that he needs to play games.",
      "It's a shame he has picked up an injury when he would have had starts and it will be fascinating to see when he is fit again if he can get into the side and if Amorim does give him more game time when he uses a back four and plays three in midfield.",
      "We should definitely give Martinez a good run at No.6 in midfield. He’s a great defender and great at forward passing. He’s a natural for midfield and could save us a lot of money.",
      "Amorim said back in November that he didn't see Martinez as a long-term option in midfield and we've only seen him there for 45 minutes since, when he came on at half-time against Aston Villa.",
      "He has played there for Ajax and has the passing range to do so, but you have to offset that with what you would lose if you took him out of the centre of defence. He can break lines with his passing from deep and is an excellent defender, arguably United's best one-on-one.",
      "I don't see him getting much of a chance in midfield. I think the long-term solution to United's issues at No.6 are going to lie in the transfer market.",

      "January is arguably one of the toughest months for Premier League managers. Not only have we reached the halfway stage of the season and fixture congestion begins to ramp up with the FA Cup returning for the top flight, teams also have to negotiate a transfer window.",
      "For Manchester United, the January transfer window very rarely offers much optimism for supporters. In their recent history, the Reds have chosen not to make big transfer statements midway through the season, even when new additions were desperately needed.",
      "When everyone knew United needed to add a centre-forward to their attack under Erik ten Hag, the Reds were left to settle with the arrival of Wout Weghorst in the January transfer window. While the Dutchman had performed well for his national team, the Premier League was clearly too big a step for the target man.",
      "Of course, clubs like United have to be wary of overspending in the mid-season window. It appears Ruben Amorim will watch the 2026 window go by without making any alterations to his team.",
      "He explained in his pre-Leeds press conference: \"We have no conversations in this moment about having any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea that is going to continue.\" This prediction is bad news for United.",
      "It is clear to United fans that at least one change should be made this month. In terms of outgoings, Joshua Zirkzee is obviously not a player who Amorim has much faith in.",
      "His substitution against Wolves at half time, despite scoring, was a clear sign the forward has no future at the club. Sadly for Zirkzee, he is not good enough to lead the line for United and, playing deeper in the No.10 role, he is not better than Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Mason Mount.",
      "The right thing to do in the January transfer window is to let Zirkzee leave, especially with Roma keen. If that deal was done, there would have been space available to add a striker to the squad who could compete with Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, the claim of no changes being made to the squad in the January transfer window suggests this plan is not under consideration. This is a blow for the Reds as they look to gain some consistency while pushing for a place in the top four.",
      "Fortunately for United, there was some positive news to close out the press conference. Amorim was asked whether he expected any of his players to come to him and request their exit from Old Trafford this month. \"No,\" Amorim replied. \"I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything.\"",
      "If this proves to be the case, it would be great news for the Reds. One of the main fears in the January transfer window is that Kobbie Mainoo will push hard for an exit in an attempt to play regularly before the World Cup.",
      "Mainoo leaving in January would be a disaster for the Reds. Not only would United be losing one of their best academy graduates in recent years, they would also be left painfully short in the midfield. Even if Mainoo only left on loan, a temporary exit would still see him take a step closer to a possible permanent exit.",
      "Injuries to Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes have proven the Reds are lacking playmakers in this squad. The Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro combination does not offer much in the way of creativity, that much is clear.",
      "United cannot afford for Mainoo to leave. If he is looking to stay in Manchester and fight for his place, that can only be good news for the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim said there are no conversations ongoing with the Manchester United hierarchy about signing new players in the January transfer window, despite the club being in the fight to qualify for next season's Champions League.",
      "United are sixth at the halfway stage of the Premier League campaign, level on points with Chelsea in fifth and only three points shy of Liverpool in fourth, but Amorim insisted that wouldn't change the plans the club have made.",
      "Amorim has previously suggested that United would consider making a move in January if the conditions were right and they were open to activating Antoine Semenyo's £65million release clause at Bournemouth, only for the attacker to opt for Manchester City.",
      "But the United head coach has now claimed there are no active conversations with director of football Jason Wilcox or chief executive Omar Berrada over strengthening the squad this month, despite the club finding themselves in a position to achieve their target of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"The transfer window is not going to change, we have no conversation to have any change in the squad,\" said Amorim. \"There is a process, there is an idea, we are near the places of Champions League, but we're also near eight teams behind us, so let’s focus on the next game.\"",
      "Amorim cut a more despondent figure over transfers than in recent weeks. Speaking on December 20, he had sounded more upbeat over the chances of adding to the squad this month.",
      "\"We will see. The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said that day. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON, it’s not going to be like that.",
      "\"Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it’s not the position that we need more. We will try to bring now, and [at] the end of the season, players that are perfect for our future. So, I don’t know what is going to happen, but it is possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Amorim also stressed that nobody had asked to leave the club this month, despite Roma showing strong interest in Joshua Zirkzee, while Kobbie Mainoo is open to a loan move having struggled for regular football this season. Asked if anyone had knocked on his door to ask to leave, Amorim siad: \"No, none of them. I don’t expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].\"",

      "Manchester United have the opportunity to secure a key transfer for Ruben Amorim, despite the Portuguese's recent comments on the club's January transfer plans.",
      "Their attempted move for Carlos Baleba in the summer hinted that a new midfielder would be prioritised. A host of names have been linked with strengthening Amorim's midfield, but the possibility of a move weighs heavily on the future of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "However, on just the second day of January, Amorim's words on United's business point towards a window that may disappointment most. Amorim previously suggested that they would consider making a move if the deal was right, although he also stated they must make no mistakes.",
      "Now, the United boss has claimed there are no active conversations with Director of Football Jason Wilcox or Chief Executive Omar Berrada regarding incomings this month. \"The transfer window is not going to change, we have no conversation to have any change in the squad,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"There is a process, there is an idea, we are near the places of Champions League, but we're also near eight teams behind us, so let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim's words will likely cause concern among supporters due to there being areas for improvement within the squad. However, not all is bad, as reports from Italy link United with a move that would strengthen the team in the summer.",
      "Calciomercato have claimed that United are one of the three clubs considering a move for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan. The France international is now in the final six months of his contract at the San Siro and could leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "Maignan came close to joining Chelsea at the start of the season, but the Premier League side opted against meeting Milan's valuation. The Italian side is keen on extending his stay, but the goalkeeper is yet to commit to his future.",
      "United changed their goalkeeper in the summer with Senne Lammens replacing Andre Onana, who joined Turkish side Trabzonspor. The Belgian has largely impressed in his first six months in England, although he has faced criticism for a number of goals conceded in recent months.",
      "Before Lammens signed, they had shown interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martínez. Next summer, the opportunity to sign one of Europe's top goalkeepers on a free transfer will be available, and it would undoubtedly improve Amorim's squad.",
      "Now that the January transfer window is open, United can agree to a pre-contract. But they will have to act quickly if they decide to make a move. Calciomercato have also claimed that Milan directors will meet with the goalkeeper's entourage after their Serie A clash with Cagliari on Friday.",

      "United face an in-form Leeds side, who are now six games unbeaten after earning a New Year's Day point at Anfield despite resting Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Noah Okafor. Amorim admitted the pace in Daniel Farke's side could cause his team some problems.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has completed his press conference ahead of the clash with Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim expects to have the same squad available to him on Sunday as the one which faced Wolves in midweek. This means the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount have not overcome the injury issues.",
      "United's manager claimed he was looking forward to the clash with Leeds, explaining he knows how important the game at Elland Road is to the fanbase. Amorim also insisted he had no qualms throwing academy players into a game of this calibre.",
      "As for the January transfer window, United fans have been told to expect few changes to the squad in January. They are not currently planning any changes as they head into the second half of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim confirmed he was not expecting any players to request an exit from Old Trafford before the end of the January window.",

United are sixth at the halfway stage of the Premier League campaign, level on points with Chelsea in fifth and only three points shy of Liverpool in fourth, but Amorim insisted that wouldn't change the plans the club have made.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is all from the first part of Amorim's press conference. Those quotes are tidied up now. The second part of Amorim's press conference will be live at 10:30pm this evening.",
      "No, none have asked. I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything.",
      "We will look to everything but they need to be prepared. You can see the squad, it is impossible and you cannot stretch the players we do not have in the moment. But of course I will try to pick the team that is ready to cope with that and then I will try to read the game and understand what I can do to help them to win the game.",
      "They have to [handle the atmosphere]. It is a game in a hostile environment but they need to be ready. They need to experience that but it is going to be hard for any player - even the guys with a lot of experience but, again, we have already experienced that. Bilbao last year was amazing, the sound, I know that feeling is completely different but we need to be ready.",
      "The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversations in this moment about having any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea that is going to continue. We are near the Champions League places but we are near also to like 18th behind us so let's focus on the next game, just that, and our focus is to win the next game.",
      "It is different, I have never experienced this one. In Portugal, there is big rivalries, here it's the same. Different environment, different culture but the noise is going to be big. We just have to perform but it is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies, different history. Let's just focus on the game - it is 11 guys vs our 11 in the beginning and we will try to win.",
      "When you play for United you need to be ready for everything. You guys have the best league in the world. Every game now and you see every week there is a lot of draws, you never understand what is going to happen at the end of that week. So it is going to be tough but it is always tough nowadays in the Premier League.",
      "They have a lot of pace sometimes we struggle with pace. They are confident but we proved we can win any game in any situation, in every context, so we will try to do that again. We know they change the system, they have different players in front. The last game they rotated two players [Calvert-Lewin, Okafor] that usually are the starters. So they have good players, good manager, great environment so it is going to be a tough game.",
      "We are playing better when we have the full squad we are clearly attacking better. We have not been good enough in the details. We should have more points in the moment but of course we are always wanting more and, again, we should have more points in the table.",
      "I heard it is a big derby, a great environment, big rivalry but every game in the Premier League is so tough so it is one more game. I know it means a lot to the fans but we need to go there and try to win.",
      "We are going [to Leeds] with no different issues. We shall see tomorrow, we have more training. I don't think anyone is going to recover but we will see.",
      "Amorim is here and the press conference will be underway shortly...",
      "Following his side's draw at Liverpool, Farke expressed his anger at the 12.30 kick-off time for Sunday's clash with the Reds when his team played on New Year's Day.",
      "I hope they can recover quickly and we'll see probably some late decisions for Sunday, when we have the earliest possible kick-off, straight after breakfast more or less, whyever this is after a late evening kick-off. today. So Man United since two days already on the sofa, whatever. We will find solutions for this fixture and at Elland Road, even if the legs will be a bit tight, we also have a chance, and we'll go for it again on Sunday.",
      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim. Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "There should be plenty of topics to discuss during Amorim's press conference this afternoon, here are just some of the things we are expecting to be on the agenda:",
      "We are just one hour away from Amorim speaking to the media ahead of the clash with Leeds on Sunday. What questions would you like to see the boss asked this afternoon?",
      "Due to scheduling, United have the chance to put the pressure on the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool early on Sunday. Should they beat Leeds, they will move above Liverpool into fourth in the Premier League before the pair have played this weekend. It may only be for a short period but moving into the top-four would be a boost for the Reds.",
      "As always, injuries will be a topic of conversation this afternoon when Amorim speaks to the media. Ahead of this game, United are currently missing a host of first-team players including; Fernandes, Mount, Mainoo, Maguire and De Ligt. Whether any of them can return this weekend remains to be seen. Mount and Mainoo are the two most likely to be back for the trip to Elland Road but Amorim will let us know if they have been cleared.",
      "Somewhat surprisingly on New Year's Day, United confirmed young midfielder Toby Collyer had been recalled from his loan spell at Championship club West Brom. Collyer had not played for the Baggies since the end of November after sustaining an injury against Birmingham City.",
      "Read more about his return here>>>",
      "In an ideal world, Manchester United would have already started their January transfer window with a bang. They were one of several clubs that were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, and although that ship hasn't yet sailed, it is now looking unlikely. Semenyo is set to leave Bournemouth this month, and United would have paid his £65million release clause, but as it stands, it looks like Manchester City are set to win the battle for the 25-year-old. United were strongly in the race, however.",
      "Rather than focusing on a signing to strengthen the attack, this approach for Semenyo was for United to bring forward the pursuit of a long-term target because he was going to be on the move now. It is a theme which is set to condition their January window.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim will be addressing the media at 1.15pm this afternoon at Carrington with an embargo set until 1.30pm. From then, we shall have everything Amorim has to say before the trip to Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Good morning and welcome along to our live press conference blog as we prepare to hear from the United manager for the first time in 2026. The Reds take on Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday.",
      "United will be under no illusions over the threat Leeds pose after they picked up a respectable point at Anfield on New Year's Day. United will hope they have at least one player to call upon again following injury. Mainoo appears to be the midfielder closest to a return to the squad but Amorim has insisted he will not be rushing any of his players back.",
      "Stay tuned for Amorim's press conference..."

      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Elsewhere on the first day of 2026, Liverpool lumbered to a goalless draw with Leeds at Anfield. Arne Slot's side have picked up better results recently, but they still aren't playing well and are having to grind out results every week.",
      "With the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa edging clear, it might be that two from three of United, Chelsea and Liverpool will qualify for the Champions League, presuming the Premier League can land that fifth spot once again for next season.",
      "There will be honourable mentions for Sunderland and Everton, who have had excellent first halves of the season, while the league is so congested that only five points separate Chelsea in fifth from Brighton in 14th. A good run of form could propel any number of clubs into the mix.",
      "For United, they would probably have taken this at the halfway stage of the campaign. They are sixth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference and three points shy of Liverpool. Qualification for the Champions League is attainable this season.",
      "The concern is that a woeful run at home might look costly come the end of the season. They have taken three points from home games against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves. The first of those played with 10 men for the best part of 80 minutes and the other three were - and still are - in poor form.",
      "United will have to improve to make the top five, but possibly not by much. Liverpool still look like a flawed team, and Chelsea are unpredictable. The departure of Maresca might change things, but a young and inexperienced squad will be tested in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Amorim's side haven't taken advantage of a kinder fixture list recently and now face Manchester City and Arsenal in January, but having put themselves in a position to achieve what was the primary objective this season, they should consider rolling the dice this month.",
      "Interest in Antoine Semenyo waned when it became clear he wanted to move to Manchester City, but United's willingness to do a deal suggests there is money available to improve the squad. The conditions for a January deal are that the focus remains on long-term targets and adding real quality this month can be difficult to do.",
      "Beefing up numbers to compensate for the lack of depth is also an issue that should ease as the month progresses. Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes should all be back fit soon and Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be back from the Africa Cup of Nations by January 19 at the latest.",
      "But United should be and are alert to opportunities in midfield, with question marks over the futures of several key players. There is also uncertainty as to whether Mainoo will push for a loan move if his chances of first-team football don't improve over the next couple of weeks.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is also eyeing up a move to Roma. His departure could leave Amorim short of attacking opportunities, with Benjamin Sesko the only natural centre-forward in the squad. Finding a permanent replacement might not be easy, but adding a striker to the squad to offer support and cover for Sesko could be beneficial.",
      "These kinds of January deals might only move the needle ever so slightly; they might only be worth a point or two come the final calculations, but in what is shaping up to be a tight race for places in the top five, that might be all it takes to make them value for money.",
      "At the halfway stage, United have put themselves in the conversation. Now they need to do all they can to finish the job.",

      "Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad. Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Baleba are targets, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen told his old club recently to make Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton their top target next summer.",
      "“I’m a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer,\" the Dutchman said via BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don’t think the move will be possible until next summer. He’s got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to be fit before the end of January, but the midfielder could remain at Manchester United for the rest of the season, rather than being loaned out again. The 21-year-old was officially recalled from his loan with Championship side West Brom on New Year's Day, but he has been at Carrington since the end of November after suffering a calf injury with the Baggies.",
      "Collyer struggled for game time before suffering his injury setback, starting just three Championship games and making 12 appearances in total. After sustaining his injury, he has been undergoing rehabilitation with his parent club. He could have returned to the Hawthorns when fit, but United have made the decision to recall him from a planned season-long loan due to concerns over his playing time in the Midlands, as well as his injury issue.",
      "The former Brighton youngster is expected to be fit again by the end of this month, having not featured competitively since sustaining a calf injury during West Brom’s 1-1 draw with Birmingham City in late November.",
      "Collyer will be monitored now that he is back at United and could stay at the club for the remainder of the season if Ruben Amorim decides to keep him as part of the first-team squad.",
      "The midfielder has made 13 appearances for United, 10 of which came under Amorim last season. Although United will have a light schedule in the second half of the season, there is uncertainty over the futures of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with both attracting loan interest.",
      "If Collyer plays for United this month, it would prohibit another loan move, as players can only play for two clubs during a season. If he doesn't feature, then another loan switch to play first-team football remains an option.",
      "United face an injury crisis in midfield at the moment, but Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are expected to be fit this month.",

      "If Semenyo does opt for the Etihad, United won't switch attention to plan B. There isn't a desperate desire to improve the attack in this window.",
      "If anything, it is the midfield which needs work, and a deal there could depend on outgoings. United are planning a significant overhaul in the centre of the pitch this year, although they will be happy to wait until the summer window to kickstart that process.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has started the ball rolling on speculation around his own future again, although he won't be going anywhere this month. The same is true of Casemiro, who is out of contract in the summer. Manuel Ugarte is wanted by Galatasaray but is currently back in the team and unlikely to depart.",
      "The biggest story of the month is therefore likely to be Kobbie Mainoo, who wants to leave on loan to play regular football, having failed to start a Premier League game under Amorim this season. Napoli are keen to take the 20-year-old until the end of the season.",
      "Mainoo is due back from a calf injury shortly and his departure wouldn't be considered while Fernandes is out with a hamstring injury and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he wants the academy graduate to stay and fight for his place and a loan move later in January might depend on whether the change in formation presents him with more opportunities and if Mainoo pushes to go. If he does, United might have to consider a move for a midfielder, although premium targets such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson will likely be out of reach in January.",
      "There could also be an exit for Joshua Zirkzee in January. Roma remain keen on the Dutch forward and are looking to put together a loan move that could include an option to buy. Zirkzee is only likely to be allowed to move once Amad and Mbeumo return from AFCON.",
      "There is also likely to be a January move for Tyrell Malacia, who was part of the bomb squad in the summer but was unable to find a new club. He made his first appearance in 11 months against Newcastle but will be made available this month.",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",
      "It didn't work and although United were missing key players in Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim refused to use those absences as an excuse, but admitted he knew why his side had struggled.",
      "\"That is normal but we didn't use that excuse against Newcastle, we are not going to use it today,\" he said. \"But of course if you see the game I understand why we play the way we play today.",
      "\"The lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle because in Newcastle we have more space to play. We didn't have to work the plays so much and today we have.\"",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

      "Wolves are on course to go down as the worst team in Premier League history - Derby recorded just 11 points in 2007/08 - but they left Manchester with a result on Tuesday. Joshua Zirkzee scored thanks to a heavily deflected strike in the 27th minute, however, Wolves drew level on the stroke of half-time following a headed goal from defender Ladislav Krejci.",
      "\"Really disappointed,\" said Martinez. \"We can't come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it's our responsibility.",
      "\"We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn't press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving around and creating spaces.\"",
      "The defender added that he believes Wolves should not be bottom of the league. \"Wolves don't deserve the place they are, it's a strong team. We respect them,\" he said. \"We have to take more risks. The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and go for the next one.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with Wolves on Tuesday evening as they brought a miserable calendar year to an end in fitting fashion.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee put United ahead with a deflected effort before Ladislav Krejci equalised on the stroke of half time.",
      "Unlike in the meeting between the two sides earlier this season, there was no second-half change of gear from United and the visitors were arguably the better team in the second half. Patrick Dorgu scored late on but it was ruled out for offside.",
      "Check out the highlights and reaction from Old Trafford below.",
      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim.",
      "Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Couple of excellent saves in either half, the second of which from Krejci was a strong hand and he reacted well to claw the ball from danger. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing radar not as good as it usually is and didn't carry the same authority as he did on Boxing Day. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: His challenge on Hwang Hee-chan led to the first goal and he was solid in the middle of the defence. Boos when replaced by Yoro showed fans are falling for him. 7",

      "A year to the day since Zirkzee was booed off against Newcastle. Not exactly a classic goal though and the kind of strike this game deserved. Heaven deserves all the credit for it, a tone-setting challenge to win the ball back and his run was the first bit of positive play in a while. United have been poor and way too cautious against the worst team in the league. They need to be braver than this.",
      "Zirkzee fires United into the lead thanks to a deflection.",
      "Superb work from Heaven, who won the ball and created the chance.",
      "We're almost 25 minutes into this game and it's been a really poor start from United against a team who are currently on course to be remembered as the worst ever in Premier League history.",
      "Hee-chan has a decent chance from the edge of the box but he fires it well over.",
      "That is excellent from Sesko, good run into the channel and with nothing on he creates the chance all by himself, shot deflected just wide. The kind of play we didn’t see from Hojlund last year, creating a chance out of nothing. Maybe that will get United going, because it’s been really flat so far. Amorim not happy at all on the touchline.",
      "Sesko creates a chance for himself after shrugging off his marker and forcing an opening.",
      "Amorim is becoming increasingly frustrated with United's lack of movement off the ball.",
      "Amorim has been waving his arms because he wants the ball played out quicker from the back. Wolves have just two points in the Premier League but they look well-organised tonight.",
      "Cunha just won a free-kick close to the box and the decision was... dubious from the referee.",
      "The back four has been and gone. The shiny new toy on Boxing Day but forgotten about before New Year’s Eve. Something of a surprise to see Amorim switch back to this system at home to Wolves, but the proof will be in the pudding. Dorgu excellent on the right wing and one of the benefits of that system was the number of players in support of the attackers. Not always had that in a back three. United should be dominating this game in terms of territory so chances to get players forward."

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

Or is it just about the best players and avoiding too many injuries? Rafa did this clever thing a few times where he set the team up to look like they were playing one formation and then once the game started they’d rapidly switch to something else. A few times in the champions league we scored a couple of early goals and then switched to shut out mode for 150 minutes. So is that just a little bait and switch tactic; you make the other team think you’re playing 4-5-1 but suddenly play 3-5-2 and flood extra players into spaces they’re not expecting.

Maybe Solanke won’t be injured forever. And maybe Kudus will carry on being the player who’s got 1 goal and 1 assist in his last 11 games. And maybe Solanke x Johnson could have been a thing again later in January when Kudus is even more knackered and looking a lot like second season at West Ham Kudus.

      "According to reports, Antoine Semenyo had an ‘agreement’ with Manchester United, but he decided to pull the plug on a move over a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, grabbing nine goals and three assists in his 18 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "The talented winger has been a key player for Bournemouth for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to another level this term and has earned admiring glances from other clubs.",
      "In recent weeks, it has emerged that every Big Six club have expressed their interest in signing Semenyo, with this competition and his £65m release clause making a January transfer inevitable.",
      "Man City and Man Utd were said to be the leading contenders for his signature, but it has emerged that he has opted for a move to the Eithad and a deal is likely to be completed in the next few days.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "On Thursday evening, a report claimed there had been a ‘breakthrough in negotiations’ between Man City and Bournemouth, who have now reached an ‘agreement’ over Semenyo.",
      "This is a blow for Man Utd, who need to sign another quality option or two in attacking areas to provide extra competition.",
      "United are currently overly reliant on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who signed instead of Semenyo in the summer.",
      "A report from journalist Duncan Castles claims Man Utd actually had an ‘agreement’ with Semenyo over persoanl terms, but this deal fell through as the winger ‘took exception to’ a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "“As we discussed in the podcast in September, Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in person to assess his character,” Castles said on the Transfers Podcast.",
      "“United had agreed personal terms with the player only for Semenyo to discover that their salary offer to him was significantly less than what they’d given Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“This allowed Bournemouth to persuade the player to sign a new contract with a release clause.”",
      "Castles has also revealed when Semenyo is likely to complete his move from Bournemouth to Man City.",
      "“I understand that Bournemouth expect to keep the player for the next two games,” Castles added.",
      "“The clause is valid for the first 10 days of January only, and they’re running it to the end of the clause before allowing him to go to another club.”",
      "He continued: “Pretty much all the top clubs in the Premier League have tried to exploit [Semenyo’s release clause].",
      "“Manchester United came back in. Chelsea enquired. Liverpool looked at time. Tottenham made an offer and failed again because he decided Manchester City was the most attractive club to move to.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo’s move to Manchester City is reportedly ‘agreed’, while Pep Guardiola’s side are also ‘in talks’ to sign Liverpool target Marc Guehi.",
      "According to reports, ‘three major reasons’ have prevented Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo from joining Liverpool in next month’s transfer window.",
      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "Man City are ‘closing in on a full agreement’ for Antoine Semenyo with Liverpool not expected to make a late move for the Bournemouth forward.",
      "Former Liverpool man Jermaine Pennant thinks it’s “really stupid” that the Reds haven’t put themselves in the position to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports."

      "There is some significant jostling for position going on now, with Chelsea throwing a spanner in the works by axeing Enzo Maresca, who had been a relative outsider to be the next out despite his increasingly perplexing post-match musings.",
      "There is now a new frontrunner. Well, we say new – both he and his current club have already been at the head of this market in different lives this season.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, Tottenham’s baffling home-away dichotomy and winless runs at Burnley and Bournemouth are all causing significant ripples.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they end 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they have somehow just about stayed in range of Arsenal at the summit.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should arbitrary position has been handed to them this week. But you still don’t want to find yourself right at the bottom of that group, do you? Having to accept that technically so far this season you’ve actually been worse than Spurs?",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. Their only wins in the last six games, all of which were winnable, have come against Burnley. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "We didn’t have to wait long for the first Big Six manager departure of 2026, and there are significant whispers that we could be in something of a London bus situation.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed his verdict on whether the Premier League giants will make “changes” in this month’s transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils are being heavily linked with several potential targets as they are crying out for upgrades in certain positions.",
      "This is despite the Premier League side having a positive summer transfer window, during which they offloaded most of their dead wood and spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "This business has boosted Amorim‘s side, but they are lacking in different departments. This is especially the case in midfield, with United requiring at least one new signing in this department in the coming weeks/months.",
      "Despite this, Amorim has indicated that there will be no “changes” to Man Utd’s squad this month.",
      "“The transfer window is not going to change, we have no conversation to have any change in the squad,” Amorim told reporters on Friday",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "“There is a process, there is an idea – that is going to continue. We are near places of the Champions League but we are also near eight teams behind us, so let’s focus on the next game.”",
      "When asked whether any of his players had knocked on his door asking to leave the club, he responded: “No, none of them.",
      "“I don’t expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].”",
      "Amorim has also boldly argued that the Red Devils should have more points than their current tally of 30 after 19 games.",
      "“I think we are playing better, when we have the full squad we are clearly attacking better, we’re not good enough in the details,” Amorim added.",
      "“We always want more and we should have more points in the table.”",
      "On facing Leeds United at the weekend, he said: “I heard that it’s a big derby, great environment, big rivalry, but every game in the Premier League is so tough.",
      "“It’s one more game, I know it means a lot to the fans but we need to go there and try to win.”",
      "“I never experienced this [rivalry]. Different environment, different culture, but the noise is going to be big. It’s hard to compare different cultures, different derbies, histories.",
      "“When you play for Manchester United you need to be ready for everything. You guys have the best league in the world, every game you see there is a lot of draws, you never understand what is going to happen at the end of that week.”",
      "In a particularly silly Mailbox, Arsenal have been backed to sign Alexander Isak to replace Viktor Gyokeres in a double deal after becoming champions.",
      "Ruben Amorim has turned another corner and ended up down a blind alley. Could he really be done for at Man United? And if so, who’s next?",
      "Chelsea parting ways with Enzo Maresca leaves Nuno Espirito Santo in a familiar position as the Sack Race favourite…",
      "The Mailbox is fed up with Chelsea’s ‘f***ing incompetent morons’, who ‘desperately need’ to appoint one of four alternatives to Liam Rosenior…",
      "Man Utd should appoint Martin O’Neill with Ruben Amorim reaching the end of the line at Old Trafford in your first Mailbox of the new year.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is at breaking point with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim looking to sell him ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports."

      "Sesko rightly has his critics, but Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens have made a huge impact and have quickly become key players.",
      "It has been widely reported that the Red Devils will look to overhaul their midfield this year as they need to sign a long-term replacement for Casemiro, while Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte have also been linked with exits.",

      "A recent report claimed Kone has been deemed a ‘perfect fit’ for Amorim’s United, while Italian journalist Francesca Teodori has boldly claimed that a deal is already a certainty.",
      "She said: “It’s not news, but it’s a fairly credible rumour. I’ve been told by multiple sources that he’ll leave Roma in June and join Manchester United.",
      "“I don’t know if this has anything to do with the [Joshua] Zirkzee deal. He might have been included as a sort of counterpart.",
      "“This remains to be seen, but what’s certain is that Kone is very keen on the destination and it looks like he could join United in June.”",
      "Now, a report from Italian outlet Calciomercato claims Roma are keen to keep Kone, who is under contract until 2029, until the summer and they want 60 million euros (£52m) for him.",
      "Roma have set this high fee as Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid are interested, while Man Utd are also facing difficulties in the race to sign Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "This is according to journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk, who have claimed that they face a ‘major problem’ as head coach Oliver Glasner complicates the operation.",
      "The report adds: ‘Oliver Glasner’s situation is causing a problem, which is likely to block any attempt Man Utd might make to land him.",
      "‘If Glasner leaves at the end of the season – as is likely – then Palace want the next manager to have a say in what happens with Mateta.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have opted to ‘turn to’ Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta as ‘talks’ over a ‘new deal’ have ‘stalled’.",
      "Manchester United are reported to be ‘closing in’ on the signing of a Roma midfielder who is said to be a ‘perfect fit’ for the centre of the park.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘targeting a shock return’ transfer during next month’s January window before they make a ‘more significant’ signing.",
      "Alexander Isak’s injury means Arne Slot now has just one recognised striker and could opt to dip into the transfer market in January.",
      "Bacary Sagna has told Manchester United that the signing of Jean-Philippe Mateta “makes sense” as the club “don’t have a No.9 who is tall” and can “get on the end ...",
      "Wilfried Zaha has hit back at Jean-Philippe Mateta over the Crystal Palace striker’s claim that he “laughed” at his “dream” of playing for France"

      "We are now deep in the most Barclays period of any season, a time where games apparently take place every day and nobody actually knows who they’re playing until the game begins or indeed what day it is or why it’s a team they only played three weeks ago.",
      "It’s just games. And then some more games. Just Our League forever and ever and ever. It is the most wonderful time of the year and don’t ask too many questions about why so many of the games seem to be low-effort, low-tempo, low-quality 0-0 draws. Don’t worry about that at all, okay?",
      "We’ve double-checked the calendar and this next bunch of games definitely take place on a weekend. We’ve double-checked their size and confirmed they are large. It is with great confidence, therefore, that we present the latest Big Weekend.",
      "",
      "It already was, probably, before the Enzo Maresca business blew up. We do rather admire the man. If the rumours are true and he really did try and use reported interest from Man City to coax an improved contract out of notorious manager-killers Chelsea, then that is rather wonderful.",
      "You’ve already been there 18 months, man! Look at the history! You’re already an ancient, decrepit manager on borrowed time by Chelsea standards!",
      "Anyway, he’s gone now. We’re not sure it will make Chelsea any better or worse in the long run. He’s never really felt like he’s that important a figure there, frankly. Neither conspicuous problem nor compelling solution.",
      "Now Chelsea have to decide what happens next. Do they double-down on their unique approach to the game? Or do they abandon the experiment altogether after throwing eye-wateringly vast sums of money at it?",
      "And in the meantime, a nice soothing trip to Manchester City to keep things ticking over. That should be easy enough, shouldn’t it?",
      "City’s title-sniffing winning run is over after being held to a goalless draw at Sunderland. But all the great and good get held to a draw at Sunderland these days.",
      "There was little sense of wheels falling off, but it does leave City precious little wriggle room here. They can’t now really afford to be handing more ground to the galloping Gunners and must cash in on any confusion or lack of focus under, as far as know at this point, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane.",
      "",
      "Your man is never, ever getting that haircut, is he? After victory against Newcastle, it appeared but a formality for United’s win counter to tick along to two via a home game against a Wolves side that was losing to absolutely everyone, including 4-1 at home to Man United just a few weeks ago.",
      "But the thing we’re all coming to realise with Manchester United is that what has gone before – even if it’s only a week or three ago – has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on what will happen next.",
      "There is no such thing as good form or bad form with United. You can’t extrapolate anything from anything they do. They simply are.",
      "Sometimes they’ll play quite well and win rather impressively. Sometimes they’ll battle to a result that shows plenty of fight and spirit. Sometimes they’ll lose narrowly to a better team. Sometimes they’ll lose badly to a worse team.",
      "And sometimes they’ll fail to beat a Wolves team that had two points all season.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t invent this version of Manchester United. All their recent managers have been capable of confidently turning corners that lead directly down another drab cul-de-sac. Especially Erik Ten Hag, but especially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But Amorim has now perfected the art. Instead of a buoyant United side with a couple of festive wins under their belts, this is now once again a reduced and uncertain Man United. And they must now head across the Pennines to face a Leeds side who actually have turned a corner in recent weeks and struck upon something that works in a six-game unbeaten runs featuring a win over Chelsea and now a pair of draws against Liverpool.",
      "Does feel like Leeds should probably sort Man United out good and proper this weekend. Which probably means Man United will actually win 4-1.",
      "",
      "Even by Bournemouth-under-Iraola standards of streak, this season is lurching towards the preposterous.",
      "We all know that Bournemouth’s schtick is to either be the best team in the country or the worst at any given time. But they really are pushing it this season.",
      "The run of five wins and three draws in eight games (after an unfortunate opening defeat to Liverpool at Anfield before everyone knew that was quite bad) that lifted Bournemouth all the way up to third in the table now feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "It’s now been 10 games without a win since a 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest back in October, and it’s fair to say Arsenal aren’t the side you’d necessarily choose to face to try and bring a 10-game winless run to an end.",
      "There’s better news ahead, because after that it’s Dr Tottenham and they are 100 per cent the very team you’d choose to try and bring an 11-game winless run to an end.",
      "But it does seem likely to get worse before it gets better for Iraola. And he’s also just clearly got this whole thing backwards too.",
      "Had Bournemouth started badly and then hit their stride he would be a solid favourite for all three of the either definitely or feasibly available Big Six jobs at this time. The bad run at the start of the season would have been attributed entirely to losing his entire defence in the summer and explained away far more easily than it is now this run of despair has come after he’s already proved he didn’t actually need all those brilliant defenders at all actually.",
      "With Antoine Semenyo’s departure also now imminent, it’s an odd old time for a manager who should be looking at the next step up the career ladder having done all kinds of brilliant things in his current job, but who might instead soon find himself coming under actual pressure in his current role having watched Bournemouth slip right down into and now out the back of the great fog of mediocrity that is this season’s Premier League mid-table peloton.",
      "",
      "Never has the disconnect between a manager and fanbase been more transparent than at Brentford v Tottenham last night.",
      "Tottenham left with precisely what they intended to – a clean sheet and a precious point in their noble quest for an 11th-placed finish. But that is not at all what the fans want or expect or consider an acceptable target.",
      "A point at Brentford is not a bad result for anyone this season. We’re halfway through the season and the only visiting team to win there this season is Man City, and that was a tense and tight 1-0 win.",
      "The result is fine. The manner of it not so much. Most Spurs fans would have settled for a point last night; but they will not settle for playing only for that point and showing neither the Dare nor the Do to strive for anything more.",
      "That is what Thomas Frank still doesn’t grasp, and why last night’s draw might actually be his most damaging result yet. Because it highlights the gulf that exists between him and fans who spent the entire game singing for lost heroes from Dele to Christian Eriksen and Mousa Dembele. Even Eric Dier’s song got an airing as, of course, did Brennan Johnson’s. Along with more than one refrain of Boring, Boring Tottenham.",
      "The fans were clear and unanimous in their displeasure – and this is the away fans Thomas Frank has previously praised in contrast to those mean home ones who make it impossible for his players to beat even Wolves at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "But in Frank’s mind, the trip to Brentford represented a job well done.",
      "It also represented the first time since the disastrous trip to Arsenal in November that he had paired Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha in midfield, adding a layer of nonsense atop that cement-mixer of a midfield by asking a third defensive midfielder in Archie Gray to play as a kind of false 10.",
      "All three are good players. All three are perfectly valid and useful members of Spurs’ squad. They absolutely do not and cannot together constitute a viable midfield three.",
      "We’ve said before and we’ll say again that Palhinha and Bentancur specifically are an either/or proposition.",
      "But Spurs simply don’t have the numbers and their manager lacks the inclination to gamble.",
      "With Lucas Bergvall, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Pape Sarr and Xavi Simons all still unavailable for assorted reasons this weekend, we fully expect to see Bentinha once again in dreary harness in Spurs’ midfield against Sunderland.",
      "Except this time it’s at home. And it won’t just be 1700 travelling Spurs fans voicing their displeasure at the sheer indignity of it all.",
      "",
      "Coventry’s serene march to the Premier League has encountered a minor bump in the road after a run of two wins, three draws and two defeats in the last seven games, but the good news for Frank Lampard and the lads is that nobody else is making a compelling case of stepping up to put any pressure on the leaders.",
      "One team with lofty ambitions to do so would be Birmingham, but after a run of four wins in six games up to the start of last month it’s now seven games without a win after a painful 3-0 defeat at Watford on New Year’s Day.",
      "",
      "La Liga is back, back, back after its Christmas break, with a local derby in Barcelona the headline act.",
      "Espanyol have their own interests too – they get back under way in fifth place and two points behind fourth-placed Villarreal – but certainly won’t mind putting a spanner in Barcelona’s title-cruising works either."

      "Amorim is the WORST Manchester United manager in 40 years. It’s not even close. People very often say since 2013 we have been crap, but we have never been this crap. We had never finished below 8th. We always challenged for the cups at least if nothing. We made a half hearted attempt at top 4. We didn’t lose to some of the worst teams to grace the Premier League. There is a period between 2013 & till Ten Hag left, and then there is this.",
      "If Amorim won his next 14 games IN A ROW, he will still be 1 win off matching David Moyes’ record at MUFC. That is an abolsutely shocking stastic. His formation is rubbish, his man management is rubbish. He is using Manchester United as work experience to learn on the job, and waste our time, effort & money. Losing to Grimsby & [drawing versus] this Wolves team in the same season is a sackable offence 10 out of 10 times. But the board will never learn. They keep hiring “up and comers” in managers, in strikers, in defense, in everything. Hoping to find a gem in a pile of horseshit, but what we are left with is just horseshit.",
      "I want Amorim to succeed, I want Manchester United to succeed. But he looks so far out of his depth, that I honestly feel 90% of the mailbox, including raigbater champion Stewie would make a better manager at MUFC. It’s that bad. Chatgpt would make better decisions. The whole job of a manager is to have good tactics & plans, manage the players, have an eye for what will work. He knows none of that. He is an embarrassment to the club and just football in general.",
      "This is a manager who was so scared of what the media will say, he preferred to lose playing 3-5-2 rather than change it to 4 at the back and win. In his own words. He is so clueless from day 1 that he himself feels 75% of his decisions were wrong.",
      "These are signs of a weak, fragile & clueless man. I will always hope the manager succeeds, but I can’t help but be frustrated. We couldnt beat fuckin WOLVES!!! And they honestly had the much better chances and should have won. It’s that bad. And all the Amorim supporters say “give him time”… it’s been 60+ games!! If you wanna back him, fair enough. But let’s not be blinded by saying this is the version of Amorim that will ever succeed. He needs to change EVERYTHING about himself, his tactics, his mindset, his knowledge, his attitude and maybe then he will have a chance.

      "Happy new year! There appears to be a lot of face saving and revisionism from Chelsea fans now, and dare I say it a divide in the fan base, so I want to kind of set the record straight and use only facts to discuss the sacking of Enzo Maresca.",
      "David Ornstein is reporting that back in October, Maresca told the Chelsea board he was already in discussions with Man City about replacing Pep. Then he was doing the same again, a second round of negotiations in December. That is a manager who has had his head turned. Would that be accepted by a fanbase if it was a player? Let’s ask Liverpool FC supporters and Trent Alexander Arnold.",
      "So Maresca isn’t focussed fully on Chelsea at this point. And that appears to have found its way to the dressing room, where he conceivably lost the players confidence and trust. Results have been pretty good since though… no? Oh. No.",
      "Then there is the argument that Maresca wasn’t backed by the Chelsea owners/board. The facts of the matter are he asked for Man City academy products who he knew. He was behind the signings of Palmer (thankfully!), Delap, Tosin and Sancho’s loan. He also asked for Dewsbury Hall, and duly received. On top of this he was handed young players capable of developing into world class talent. Yet he has appeared completely incapable of coaching a defence or improving any individual. His greatest successes in respect of individual players are Robert Sanchez now making fewer mistakes and Reece James being injury free for a year. That’s pretty much it.",
      "There are Chelsea fans saying that Maresca wasn’t given time. He had 18 months. Maresca was the tenth longest serving Premier League manager when the bell chimed on his final minute in charge.",
      "Finally we have the “he had to rotate to keep everyone happy” argument. And Chelsea’s bloated squad is the reason behind the rotation. A reminder then, that in every single competition Chelsea play in, they are bound by the same squad size limits as every other team. They are not trying to give 60 different players minutes in the Premier League. It’s just not a thing. Chelsea have used 25 different players in the Premier League. The same number as Man United, Wolves, Brighton and Sunderland. One player more than Arsenal and Man City. Yet Chelsea have made the most changes to their starting 11.",
      "Maresca’s stubborn refusal to find/use a consistent lineup or even consistent spine ultimately led to Chelsea lacking consistency until his final breath, as it were.",
      "His greatest win is undoubtedly the club World Cup success. A genuine display of tactical awareness caught even me off guard, in a final where we out PSG’d PSG. But an end of season cup competition where Maresca could consistently play his best team, with the fewest changes to each starting line up… well, that’s there for all to see isn’t it. Consistency breeds consistency.",

I am sure an EPL club can afford better talent and tools, but would still be subject to the same limitations of a small data set. 38 games is just not enough and as teams change dramatically each season (and half season) not sure that past data is as useful.

      "Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly ‘determined to revive’ his Manchester United career months after his exit from the club was blocked, and amid a continued lack of minutes.",
      "United have made their preferred midfield pairing clear. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro has played the majority of games there together this season, and Mainoo has been given hardly any minutes.",
      "The Englishman is yet to start a Premier League game this season, having featured 212 minutes in the competition in all this term.",

      "Though his minutes have been sparse since it’s said the midfielder does not want to quit the club.",

      "At the time of that incident, United legend Roy Keane suggested there was a way back for Mainoo, despite his brother’s antics, and it seems he’s in agreement.",
      "Keane said: “Are you telling me that he can’t sit there for another six months? He might think the manager’s on his way out in the summer. He’s 20 years of age, what’s wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he’s not getting a chance, we’ve all had to do it.",

      "The two sides were separated by goal difference heading into the final two games of the Premier League season, and both faced difficult fixtures. United had to travel to Blackburn and host Tottenham, while Arsenal visited Leeds and took on Aston Villa at Highbury.",
      "Arsenal blinked first. They were beaten 1-0 by Leeds 24 hours before United drew 0-0 at Ewood Park, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink netting the goal that effectively crowned United champions.",
      "But the game will always be remembered for the inexplicable profligacy of crossbar challenge champion Kaba Diawara, who was thwarted by woodwork and Nigel Martyn about four times in a 19-minute substitute cameo.",
      "The striker had joined that January for £2.5m, and was billed by Arsene Wenger as the next Nicolas Anelka. Fifteen games, no goals and 123 days after moving to north London, he was loaned back out to France and never played for the Gunners again.",
      "The next Nicolas Anelka he was not.",

      "He was not a good asset for the future. A month later he was sent off for a lunge on Blackpool’s DJ Campbell and things never really got any better, with the Cameroonian eventually playing just eight league games for Villa before leaving for Olympiakos on loan and then Rennes on a permanent deal after new Villa manager Paul Lambert said he “had not got a clue what he looks like”.",

      "Eddie Howe reacted to his first January transfer window as a Premier League manager with all the restraint of Neil Custis in an argument with Jim White. That Josh King ended their first top-flight season as top scorer with seven goals suggested they needed a striker, but Juan Iturbe, Benik Afobe and Lewis Grabban for a combined £18m is rarely ever the answer to any question other than ‘what would you buy if consequences didn’t exist?’.",
      "Iturbe was a loan, and Afobe was vaguely understandable, the Premier League virgin having impressed with Championship Wolves. But the deal for Grabban was just bizarre. Bournemouth signed the forward for £300,000 in 2012, sold him for £3m in 2014, then watched him score one goal in six top-flight games for Norwich before deciding to part with £8m to bring him back.",

      "“He is a strong, powerful and quick centre-forward with a real eye for goal, and will increase our attacking options in the second half of the season,” said Chris Hughton, who must have felt pretty pleased with himself when Locadia scored on his debut from the bench; it would be the first of only three goals in 34 Premier League appearances.",
      "He had a couple of loans with options to buy – FC Cincinnati and Bochum chose not to – before Locadia was allowed to leave for nothing in winter 2022. He is going to the World Cup with Curacao despite not actually having a club.",

      "There might be an element of recency bias at play, but also for the cool price of £12m Burnley received precisely two goals in 22 games from Weghorst, who scored more often on loan at both Besiktas and Hoffenheim.",
      "Not at Manchester United, though, with whom Weghorst ultimately made what will surely be the Premier League appearances of his career before being crowned the club’s “worst player” ever.",
      "Burnley received a bit of cash for those loans away, but not nearly enough to mask their embarrassment.",
      "",
      "We’re reserving judgement on Mykhaylo Mudryk for now and though Fernando Torres is another obvious answer, especially since his transfer fee was more than twice that of Cuadrado, his impact was three or four times more telling than the Colombian’s.",
      "Torres can at least claim to have played a huge part in the club’s Champions and Europa League wins; Cuadrado started four Premier League games and assisted one goal in their run to the title after arriving in January 2015. He was loaned out to Juventus that summer, then again in August 2016, and left Stamford Bridge to make his Turin move permanent in May 2017.",

The Frenchman played 13 games, left for less than £2.75m after nine months and was playing for Bayern Munich within seven years.",

      "Then-manager Sam Allardyce (still seems odd) described him as “the best in Europe” at the price of £27m in 2018. It never sounded right and 11 goals in 61 games for Everton can be offered as pretty compelling evidence.",

Honesty, he did, I’m telling you now, he did not stop eating. He was a big boy. And you know the protein bars, every time you’d see him, he’d be walking around the training ground with a f***ing protein bar.”",
      "What Sidwell did not say: The Greek striker was signed for £12m in January 2014 and he played three games without scoring a goal before Fulham were relegated. He eventually left the club in 2016, with Fulham somehow recouping around half their investment from Benfica. Who then flipped the striker on to Marseille. He was last seen in the German amateur leagues.",
      "",
      "There can only be one. It is thought that Leeds have ultimately stumped up around £40m to ‘sign’ Augustin, who joined in January 2020, played 48 minutes for them and left for Nantes that October.",
      "Their legal department might disagree but Leeds were made to pay Leipzig for the forward when a clause in his loan was triggered upon promotion in lockdown, then had to compensate Augustin himself for breach of contract.",
      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire described Augustin as ‘the most expensive player in football history in terms of cost per appearance’ at ‘£13,715 per second for Leeds’.",

      "No laptop guru worth his charger would possibly have sanctioned a £35m move for a 22-year-old striker with 14 top-flight career goals, yet Liverpool were panicked into such a move in January 2011.",
      "With Fernando Torres headed to Chelsea, a replacement had to be sourced. Newcastle were so stunned that Carroll was the chosen one that they rejected an initial £30m bid. Then Liverpool somehow came back with an extra £5m to get their man.",
      "Carroll became the eighth most expensive footballer – and most expensive British player – ever at the time. He did not make his debut until March, did not score his first goal until April, netted just 11 times in 58 games overall, and was sold for just £15m in 2013. At least Steven Caulker and Ozan Kabak were loans.",
      "",
      "Before Harry Kane officially made it A Thing, Bony was busy scribbling ‘top Premier League scorer in a single calendar year with 20 goals in 2014’ under the achievements section of his CV. And it bloody well worked, as Manchester City were so impressed with the Swansea forward’s productivity that they parted with £25m to sign him and ostracise Edin Dzeko. Ten goals in 46 games hardly convinced the newly-appointed Pep Guardiola that he could lead the line.",

      "Remember when Manchester United fans were giddy about this one? Remember when swapping lazy, pea-hearted Henrikh Mkhitaryan for street-fighter Alexis Sanchez was seen as a phenomenal deal? Remember the piano and the glee?",
      "Less than three years later, they allowed Sanchez to leave for a free transfer (and had to pay him a wedge themselves), having realised that simply offering the Chilean higher wages than Manchester City did not count as a trophy. Jose Mourinho at least had a chance to gaslight someone.",

      "In terms of our attack, we are showing signs of being up there with the best of them – only Arsenal and City have scored more. The fact that we spent a decent amount of money on our attack in the summer means this is not a coincidence, and the underlying stats (expected goals) help show that the system and style of play is leading to a healthy number of chances being created. It feels like Sesko and Cunha still have gears to find, which is an exciting prospect. The two who have been playing CM have definitely contributed (9 goals and 10 assists between them). Bruno is just doing Bruno, but Casemiro’s form has been a pleasant surprise. In terms of the WBs, Dalot takes a lot of stick at times but he has produced this season (1 goal and 5 assists – just about as good as any other FB/WB in the league), and Dorgu seems to finally be finding his feet in the PL. Our set-pieces have been on point too.",
      "On the flipside, we haven’t been as strong in defence as only 6 teams have conceded more than us. Instinctively I think are we getting caught out of shape too often or is there an issue around the balance of the team. I can’t exactly deep dive into the stats as I don’t work at this for a living but looking at the high level numbers available, the outlier seems to be goals conceded from open play (15 vs 10) and counter attacks (4 vs 1), not set piece goals conceded (9 vs 8) when compared to the average of teams above us (ignoring penalties and OGs which are negligible). Therefore, on the face of it, this suggests Ruby hasn’t got the balance right yet in transition and/or defence.",
      "Interestingly however (for the nerd in me anyway), a comparison can be made with Palace who employ a reasonably similar shape (3 at the back, wingbacks and 2 in CM). They have conceded 9 fewer goals (20) – only 7 of these have come from open play and only 1 on the counterattack, suggesting this type of system can work in terms of defence. So, whether it’s a personnel issue (individual mistakes) and/or a tweak to the system, Ruby would do worse than look to Palace for some of the answers in defence.",
      "Overall, it’s an A for effort in attack but a D in defence. Yet sitting 6th at the halfway point (assuming Sunderland don’t do any damage against City) is not too shabby and would have been acceptable to any supporter at the start of the season. Yes, we could have picked up more points and could be inexplicably sitting second in the table. I could have also won the Euromillions and sunning myself somewhere exotic in the world instead of freezing my xmas walnuts off in a wintery UK. But the universe is not ready for any of those things to happen right now – this is year 1 of a rebuild so be patient and see where we end up and, in the meantime, I’ll keep wasting money on the lottery.\nGarey (one of these days Rodney, we’ll be champions again) Vance, MUFC",

      "On this rather sleepy and flu-filled NY eve an article about MU scouting for a replacement caught my eye (Man Utd ‘begin work on plans’ to replace Ruben Amorim with PL boss ‘leading the race’ – Football365). I found myself half praying this to be true. I don’t want to be that fan that is constantly calling for change, constantly highlighting the managers shortcomings and overlooking their strengths – but it does feel like Amorim’s race is run.",
      "He keeps making the same mistakes; for a copy of the Everton game this season, see the Lyon game from last season. You might argue that we won against Lyon, but it was in spite of the managers decision making, not because of it. His decision to marginalise some of the playing staff is now biting us on the backside – the likes of Zirkzee, Malacia and Mainoo could have been important for this period (i.e. during AFCON) but because they have had virtually no minutes up till now they don’t have the match sharpness or rhythm to their game.",
      "Amorim may well be a good coach, but this job has come too early for him. The fact that he admits he would do 75% of things differently, means he is only getting 25% of things right – that’s not good enough. Especially when you consider this might be one of the best collection of players we have had since Fergie departed, second only to Mourinho’s side. The decision to revert to 3-4-3 felt like a backwards step last night and the performance was evidence of that.",
      "Anyways, in terms of the article, it seems that Glasner is seen as a safe bet. I can see why; he is out of contract soon, he’s won silverware on the continent and at his current club, he knows how to manage the demands of the league and European football, the rhythm and intensity of the PL is not new to him and generally speaking his stock is at an all-time high. If he can bring Guehi along with him that would make the scousers really lose their heads – we would all get a kick out of that.",
      "Another name has recently come to mind as well, a certain Martin O’Neill. I am not sure he is a name that some fans or Sir Jim would approve, but there is something about Martin that reminds me very much of Ferguson. He has had success north of the border, he knows the game and the English league well, he strikes me as being less rigid in the way he see’s the game (certainly when compared to Amorim), at one point in the early 2000’s he was considered as a replacement for the Great Scot himself.\nIbrahim Khalid",
      "",
      "Watching Ruben Amorim’s press conferences lately, I keep thinking less about tactics and more about tone, and not in a good way. Too often, his interviews sound like a manager making excuses instead of setting standards.",
      "It reminds me of a boss I had at McDonald’s. On paper, he was fine. He knew the systems, followed the manual, and checked all the boxes. But his team talks before a rush were dreadful. Everything was framed around what might go wrong, who needed to be careful, and why today would be difficult. You didn’t feel motivated; you felt prepared for failure. Unsurprisingly, shifts with him always felt harder than necessary.",
      "That’s the same feeling Amorim’s media appearances give off. There’s a constant lowering of expectations, a subtle sense of limitation. We’re not quite there, this will be difficult, we must be realistic. Honesty is fine, but elite football isn’t a therapy session. At some point, messaging influences mindset, and mindset affects performance.",
      "People love to say players don’t listen to press conferences. That’s nonsense. They hear the tone, absorb the narrative, and it seeps into the dressing room whether anyone admits it or not. You don’t need Mourinho-era bravado, but you do need conviction. Right now, Amorim often sounds like someone hoping to survive rather than take charge.",
      "At McDonald’s, the difference between a bad shift and a good one was often just a manager who spoke like we could handle it. In football, the margins are thinner, the stakes higher and sounding like you’re already managing the explanation before and after kick-off is rarely the mark of a side about to surprise anyone.\nGaptoothfreak, Man.

      "To go from 15th last season with no real hope to being 6th and actually seeing us play some decent football more often than not is already more progress than any realistic fan could have hoped for this year. We pose a very real attacking threat against anyone even with Sesko not coming to the party. Our build up play and passing is very good in spells and our keeper is a massive upgrade. Our midfield is clearly in need of improvement and our defence is still leaking way too many goals but so what. Last season we were shit with absolutely no hope. This season we are up there just behind the actual decent teams having made some very clear improvement and also having some very clear areas we need to improve.",

      "Unai Emery isn’t a perfectly decent manager; he’s an excellent manager. He’s Aeons beyond Arteta. £675m net spend in 5 years for Arsenal and only an FA Cup Trophy to show for it. £65m net spend for Villa over the same period, in which Emery has taken a Villa side from battling relegation to top 3 this season and competitive in cup competitions. He’s won trophies at every club he’s been at, including the same trophy with two different clubs; he’s won a championship in France – he’s probably going to win a trophy this season with Villa, albeit it won’t be the league.",
      "Emery took over from a longstanding club legend and improved on the league finish in his first season – look at his squad available to him and the squad available to Arteta – let me know which of those players would get into today’s team. Emery got Arsenal to a European final; Arteta couldn’t even get past Villareal (Emery won it that year with them). Emery should have been given the time that Arteta has been afforded and the transfer budget to match – Arsenal would have likely won considerably more than they have in the last few years.",

      "The game turned on Arsenal battering our best midfielder in the game (Onana) meaning he had to go off. It’s not a surprise we then struggled in set pieces and lost our defensive screen that was working so well. Arsenal fans booing the referee was genuinely mental. They committed TWICE as many fouls as we did. If we are accused of going down too easily I refer you to Gabriel going down like a sack of spuds in an arial battle with… checks notes… 4’2” Emi Buendia. I saw Benduia in Sainsbury’s once. He’s tiny.",
      "Second half a mistake (another one…) by Martinez let Arsenal in and we struggled after that as it bouyed the home team and the crowd. Small margins and all that Scott Parker nonsense. Arsenal did indeed then ’smell blood’ as Arteta put it and put us to the sword.",
      "Lastly, let’s not forget the background to Arsenal/City/Liverpool/Chelsea. Our bench cost roughly £70 million. Or roughly one Eze. When they have almost another £200m worth of players on the bench it is a mismatch like 90% of the games Arsenal and the others play. Every Villa fan I have spoken to (I don’t deal in social media noise) found the talk of a title challenge either confusing or hilarious. No one took it seriously for this very reason. No one can compete with this, built in, financial imbalance over a whole season. You can point to Leicester but that was 10 years ago and the gap has widened even more considerably since then.",

Most Arsenal attacks have always come from the right side where Saka plays. However, Saka wants to dribble, shoot or pass backwards. In yesterday’s game, Trossard was moving the ball faster and releasing it even faster. No wonder, Villa could not cope with the second half intensity, and Gyokeres was getting service. All the four goals originated from the left hand side. This is the way to break down low-block and stubborn teams. With Saka dilly dallying, the defenders have ample time to close shop.I hope he learns from this game.\nYiembe, Mombasa",

      "The point does, however, remain that a separation likely suits both parties after almost a decade together. Salah cannot really accept a lesser role on the biggest wage at a club which has not outgrown one of their greatest ever scorers and players, but is attempting to move away from his attacking autonomy.",
      "",
      "It seems a bold call to make about one of the Premier League’s form sides, a manager and squad which navigated unbeaten a hazardous December path through five opponents currently placed 11th or above.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin also literally cannot stop scoring; at this point it is ruining the lives of his family and friends.",
      "But is this formation, approach and attitude change really sustainable enough to carry Leeds and Daniel Farke through the next few months? And is a six-point gap so substantial as to sufficiently safeguard them from the drop?",
      "This might be the new normal for Leeds and Calvert-Lewin – and there is a point to be made about whether West Ham and Nottingham Forest can generate enough vague competence to punish any slips either way – but the history of this club and coach does suggest a reversion to the mean is impending.",
      "",
      "Feel like pure shit, just want the inherent managerial precariousness of the 2022/23 season back.",
      "It was perhaps the greatest time to be alive, when a ludicrous number of clubs panicked to the absurd extent that it ended with Sam Allardyce, Dean Smith, Ruben Selles and Ryan Mason in gainful employment.",
      "The best part was in how some of those fearful teams reacted by not necessarily drunkenly calling their ex, but instead skipping back a few relationships to land on someone they were with a couple of decades ago and who has moved on and settled down with someone else since.",
      "Leicester literally considered reappointing Martin O’Neill and only the daftest of footballing institutions would consider such a thing in the 2020s.",
      "There is a sense building that we could see something similar soon. Our favourite picks? Roy Hodgson rocking back up at Crystal Palace in a post-Glasner haze; West Ham bringing Slaven Bilic back to replace Nuno Espirito Santo, who embraces another Championship promotion push at Wolves; Mauricio Pochettino falling into the Spurs job after the World Cup; and Nottingham Forest realising they have sacked everyone before deciding to go around again, starting with Steve Cooper.",
      "Oh, and obviously Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool caretaker manager.",
      "",
      "One of the likelier examples of a mistakenly rekindled relationship might well emanate from West London. It’s not like Chelsea and Frank Lampard haven’t accidentally fallen back into bed with each other before.",
      "That 11-game, single-win interim spell from April to May 2023, in which a bar systematically lowered by Graham Potter was dragged towards the core of the actual Earth by a shell-shocked Lampard purely because Todd Boehly wanted to make Mediawatch look stupid, should never be forgotten.",
      "Both club and manager have changed since. Although Chelsea haven’t really, considering Enzo Maresca is on the brink of leaving in the middle of a season the Blues started by being crowned world champions, purely because he made a comment he simply does not want to properly clarify and would instead prefer to continue digging a hole directly out of Stamford Bridge.",
      "Lampard certainly seems to have grown from his most recent experiences at Chelsea. He has guided Frank Lampard’s Coventry City to the top of the Championship with promotion in their hands. But it was ultimately only ever a rebound and one agitated call from Boehly in October will be enough to end that beautiful union.",
      "",
      "It will be interesting to see what Chelsea’s succession plan consists of, considering Maresca has more than three years left on his contract and has, for all intents and purposes, felt forced out despite being precisely the sort of malleable coach the Blues seemed to want post-Pochettino.",
      "Perhaps Champions League qualification and a couple of trophies strengthened Maresca’s character and resolve to the extent he started developing ideas above his station. And maybe a hierarchy whose football acumen remains under intense scrutiny is going to be appointing a fifth manager in three and a half years of ownership soon.",
      "Maresca has his faults but can walk with his head held high into most jobs as a result of his work. Eddie Howe is approaching what feels like the end of his Newcastle road, and would provide compelling testimony to how much more control the Italian might expect to exert on Tyneside than at Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "The long-running joke is that ‘only Salah’ was once a ubiquitous preface to most football stats. It appears to have been usurped by ‘only Haaland’, but also specifically for stats involving, well, only Haaland.",
      "For example, only Haaland (in 2022/23) has ever scored more goals before the turn of the year in a Premier League season than his tally so far in 2025/26. He is competing with himself at this stage.",
      "And halfway through the campaign, he is more than halfway to matching his record of 36 for most goals in a Premier League season. With his longest drought in 2025/26 to this point lasting two matches, only Haaland seems to be in the mood.",
      "",
      "But performative passive-aggressive praise is draining and four years of nitpicking Haaland’s latest hat-trick has taken an inevitable toll on Guardiola.",
      "The outlook is far brighter than this time last year, when the entire project seemed to be unravelling at a rate even 115 upheld charges would struggle to match. That run of one win in 13 games was brutal.",
      "Guardiola withstood that, even signing a contract extension towards the start of it, to oversee a new Manchester City chapter which doesn’t half resemble the last in terms of putting together ridiculous winning runs which no-one notices until it’s too late.",
      "That really must be exhausting, however, and recent speculation over his future might build to a crescendo of his departure after a decent enough decade.",
      "",
      "Having already declared he “would do 75% of things different” if given another go at his first year in charge of Manchester United, it was entertaining to see Amorim revert to his old ways as soon as the apparent gimme of a home game against Wolves presented itself.",
      "That he and Manchester United made a hash of even drawing with one of the worst teams in Premier League history only added to the dark comedic undertones.",
      "There has been undoubted progress for a club eyeing the Champions League rather than the Championship, but there will come a time when those in charge of the decisions at Manchester United start to wonder whether this was all worth it or indeed the only viable route back.",
      "They are fully invested in Amorim and willing to forgive his faults, seemingly at least in part because he himself speaks so candidly about them while Jason Wilcox and friends maintain a vow of silence.",
      "Amorim, in the meantime, will continue to hone his Solskjaer-esque knack of spacing out his wins and defeats perfectly to keep the boom-bust cycle going.",
      "",
      "For a more specific prediction, we go to Tuchel himself:",
      "“I think we all understand that when it comes to knockout football it’s: ‘How do we go out?’. It’s different if we lose 3-0 in a round of 32 to a huge underdog and we completely underperform, or you lose with a red card in the second minute for the goalkeeper and you go out and you put up a big fight in a quarter-final and you go out on penalties and play 120 minutes with 10 men.”",
      "Perfect. A brave, valiant shoot-out defeat to Brazil in the last eight after coasting through the groups and past Mexico it is.",
      "Tuchel has proven to be a very good England manager, negotiating the myriad issues it presents and growing into the role with impressive authority. But he knows as well as anyone how fickle tournament football can be, even if he has already shown that this is a short-term arrangement which ought to be extended.",
      "",
      "Their standing at the top of both tables heading into the new year should not be too heavily emphasised; Liverpool enjoyed such a command this time last season but were then immediately eliminated from the Champions League by eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "There was even a mild wobble or two in the Premier League and domestic cups but the Reds were deserved champions long before the end.",
      "Some but obviously not all of that was ultimately down to the lack of a competent challenger, as Arsenal themselves continued to trip over their own feet while everyone else imploded.",
      "Arsenal will be kept honest by Manchester City until the very end in the Premier League, and there is little point forecasting their journey in Europe.",
      "But this is a wildly strong squad and increasingly mature coach, both of whom have sustained enough blows and learned the requisite lessons to start pulling through when it matters.",
      "And predicting Arsenal will win both the Premier and Champions League in 2026 does make it far easier to accuse them of bottling when they don’t accomplish something few teams ever have.",
      "There is no need for football to reinvent itself, just for sustainability to be seen as central rather than peripheral. Following Tottenham would help.",
      "Enzo Maresca has joined the long list of short-lived Chelsea managers, and the identity of the favourite to replace him is obvious when you think about it.",
      "Pep Guardiola has revealed he has “no idea” if Enzo Maresca has had talks about taking the Manchester City job, as he spoke on his own future at the club.",
      "The favourite to take over the Chelsea job after the departure of Enzo Maresca, Liam Rosenior has broken his silence on the links with the Blues.",
      "Former Tottenham man Jamie O’Hara has revealed he would go and get former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca “right now” if Spurs are able to.",

      "This year’s January transfer window is already shaping up to surpass last season’s equivalent, with Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo emerging as the early favourite to be the most expensive signing as a £65m deal nears.",
      "There have also been murmurs of Arsenal and Manchester United doing business if the right opportunities arise, while Spurs are also likely to be active as they are set to recoup £35m after ‘agreeing’ a deal to sell Brennan Johnson, who also has other options, to Crystal Palace.",
      "This will see Tottenham accept a £15m loss on Johnson, who joined the north London outfit via the Harry Kane money as a £50m signing to fill the huge void left by the Bayern Munich superstar.",
      "Johnson overcame an uninspiring debut season to star in Tottenham’s Europa League triumph by scoring some vital goals, but the Welshman, like Dominic Solanke, has been derailed by the summer appointment of Thomas Frank, who has preferred other attackers.",
      "So, with Johnson retaining most of his value but lacking minutes, he is the most obvious candidate to be sold to fund Tottenham’s moves in January and next summer, while the player can benefit from being a bigger fish at a very reputable Premier League club. Really, everybody wins.",
      "And this got us thinking. Theoretically, if the remaining Big Six sides also had to pick one player bought for £50m+ within the last three years to cut ties with to finance their next lot of signings, who would they choose and why? From Arsenal to Manchester United, here is what they should do in this scenario…",
      "",
      "It’s just not working, is it?",
      "Gyokeres was billed as Arsenal’s final piece of the jigsaw when he was supposedly bought to fix Mikel Arteta’s striker problem in the summer, but they are arguably in the same boat as they were without the Swedish international.",
      "The 27-year-old bulldozer scored at a ridiculous rate over two years for Sporting Lisbon, but the Premier League is a completely different level and he has been found out this term.",
      "His tally of five goals in 17 Premier League games is not disastrous on paper, but two of these goals have been penalties and he has only scored once in his last seven outings.",
      "Gyokeres is a different profile from Arsenal’s other strikers, and he is certainly the best finisher inside the box, but he has offered next to nothing in general play and Gabriel Jesus has looked far brighter when replacing him in recent weeks. This will likely also be the case once Kai Havertz is back up to speed.",
      "Arsenal made the biggest statement in the title race so far on Tuesday night by brushing in-form Aston Villa aside to win 4-1, but Gyokeres was the noticeable weak link before he was replaced. He could feasibly end this season as Arteta’s third-choice striker, so the north London outfit would be astute to cut ties before his value declines even further.",
      "READ: Premier League managers of 2025 as Mikel Arteta nudged up one place",
      "",
      "A major hallmark of Todd Boehly’s reign at Stamford Bridge has been Chelsea’s unrelenting insistence on hoarding up-and-coming wingers and ignoring other positions in desperate need of upgrades: a new goalkeeper, centre-back and striker.",
      "This continued in the summer as the Blues brought in Gittens, Estevao and Alejandro Garnacho to fill the squad spots previously occupied by Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke.",
      "In fairness to Chelsea, it is at least the case that the latest batch of wingers are upgrades on last season’s options, but Estevao and Garnacho have certainly outshone Gittens.",
      "Estevao could become something quite special, though it appears that Garnacho also has a higher ceiling than Gittens, who is much further from being the final product than his two teammates, despite being in a similar age bracket.",
      "Chelsea are proven to adopt a cut-throat approach regarding player sales under this regime, with Gittens standing out as the most obvious casualty of their current group of wingers.",

      "",
      "Isak eventually got what he wanted in the summer, but was his move to Liverpool really worth all of that effort?",
      "By resorting to drastic measures to seal his move to Liverpool from Newcastle United, Isak sacrificed pre-season to leave himself playing catch-up with his new teammates and just as he started to show signs of being back to his usual self, he suffered a leg break in a challenge with Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven and will have months on the sidelines.",
      "Isak remains a world-class striker capable of starring for any club in the world, but this unfortunate run of events have contributed to a chastening few months for Liverpool’s new British record signing, with his situation made more problematic by Hugo Ekitike’s performances.",
      "While Isak’s start to life at Liverpool has been ponderous at best, Ekitike immediately hit the ground running and has surely surpassed the expectations of even the most optimistic figures at the club.",
      "Especially considering Liverpool’s dire decline, 13 goal involvements in Ekitike’s first 25 competitive appearances is a fantastic effort. This is made even better by him also being a sublime technical footballer, resembling Thierry Henry in his pomp.",
      "So, as good as Isak clearly is, Liverpool would be just fine with Ekitike if push came to shove and the £130m that went on an unnecessary second new striker could be redistributed to land multiple new centre-backs and a successor for Mohamed Salah.",
      "",
      "The 2024/25 campaign was certainly a rare one to forget for Man City as their era of dominance ended with a whimper, though January signing Marmoush was a highlight of an otherwise poor campaign.",
      "Signed as part of Man City’s accelerated squad overhaul, Marmoush scored seven goals in his first 16 Premier League games and was Pep Guardiola’s best player during last season’s run-in.",
      "The 26-year-old was expected to kick on this season, but he has dramatically gone backwards and is still without a Premier League goal this term.",
      "Injuries have played their part, but also the freakish form of Erling Haaland has meant he has not had a sniff up front, while he has also been outperformed by other Man City wingers, particularly Jeremy Doku.",
      "And with Semenyo on the brink of joining Man City in January, Marmoush is already on the back foot and could even join rivals Spurs as they look to replace Johnson with a successor with a far greater output.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was another option for Man Utd as he has been unconvincing in the shadow of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but Ugarte is their last fully fledged flop and needs to be sold as soon as possible by INEOS.",
      "Signed as a potential successor to Casemiro, Ugarte, who was also expected to benefit from a reunion with Ruben Amorim, has actually proven to be a huge dud for the Red Devils as an incredibly limited midfielder.",
      "Casemiro’s unexpected resurgence has further exposed Ugarte’s limitations in possession, with Man Utd looking far worse when the former Sporting Lisbon player is on the pitch instead of the veteran.",
      "Ugarte’s woes have forced Man Utd to get back to the drawing board for a new No.6 as they eye Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson, with their current star’s possible move to a Turkish giant to play a huge role in the club’s priority midfield overhaul next year.",
      "In a particularly silly Mailbox, Arsenal have been backed to sign Alexander Isak to replace Viktor Gyokeres in a double deal after becoming champions.",
      "The sale of ‘popular’ Tottenham figure Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace has reportedly ‘not gone down well’ within the Spurs squad.",

      "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ran Walcott close as one of the few top-class winter signings Arsenal have ever made, but Odegaard’s influence on the most exciting side the Emirates has seen for too long makes him a worthy choice.",
      "The Norwegian was handed the armband in 2022 following Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette’s departures and Odegaard has flourished with the added responsibility.",
      "",
      "It feels likely that Rogers has triggered the necessary clauses to double the value of his initial £8m signing from Middlesbrough in January 2024. Which is a shame because a reported £80m price tag would make that a delightful sort of mark-up.",
      "Villa might nevertheless update those demands soon to better reflect the importance of a player with 10 goal involvements this season, as well as extensive Champions League and international experience.",
      "There is a simple lesson here: all the best footballers are somewhere in Boro.",

And the captain is still going relatively strong, starting eight games this season to stretch his lead as Bournemouth’s record Premier League appearance maker to 61.",

      "While Chelsea have historically struggled to add another attacking dimension to their squad mid-season, they have fared much better with defensive reinforcements. Gary Cahill was a fantastic addition in 2012, perhaps bettered only by that of Ivanovic four years before. The Serb spent nine years at Stamford Bridge, winning ten trophies in the process.",

He was one of Roy Hodgson’s first signings at Fulham in 2008 from FC Copenhagen and the defender became a stalwart through one of the greatest periods in the club’s history, with all of his seven seasons at Fulham spent in the Premier League.",
      "He made 270 appearances before he was released by Felix Magath, who Hangeland later claimed had instructed him to ease a thigh injury by placing a block of cheese on his leg. “I always try to see the good in people,” Hangeland said. “But Magath was an awful human being.”",

He assists, he plays, he behaves, he’s fair, doesn’t dive, doesn’t try to put opponents in the stands with an accumulation of cards,” the Portuguese added, doing one of his weird winks in the general direction of eventual winner Suarez.",
      "Dzeko arguably never earned the adulation he deserved at the Etihad, with a respectable 50 goals in 130 Premier League games, of which only 74 were starts. Only Sergio Aguero scored more goals (40) across the club’s first two title-winning seasons than the Bosnian (30).",

      "United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Prodded further as to whether players had come to him to ask to leave the club this window, Amorim added: \"No. None of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask for anything.\"",
      "\"It's an ambition [of mine] to be the best midfielder in the world. I just want to work hard, to take some advice, to take something from the midfielders. Not just in the Premier League, because I learned a lot from here,\" he said.",

      "\"In LaLiga, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets. I try to learn every day. I'm watching them on YouTube.\"",
      "Baleba took his love for the game to France from Douala, Cameroon, with Lille beckoning. After rising through the ranks in France, a move to Brighton and the Premier League soon followed. He made the move to the Amex in August 2023 but it was his performances in the 2024/25 season that made everyone take note.",
      "Under the guidance of Fabian Hurzeler, Baleba emerged as one of the league's finest midfield prospects. But after a whirlwind summer, it's been a slower start to this campaign. The spotlight was always an ambition for Baleba but he didn't expect the speed at which his reputation would rise.",
      "\"When I see my name everywhere, I'm happy,\" he says. \"When I was a kid, it was a wish for my dad and my mum. It's a wish for me.",

      "Friday 2 January 2026 20:40, UK",
      "Fourteen losses, 11 draws and 13 wins represent Manchester United's 2025 in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim. But nothing has been more reflective of their uncertain future under the Portuguese boss than his team selections, shape and approach.",
      "In November of 2024, a then-confident and vibrant Amorim, in his first interview with the club, explained the importance of establishing an identity.",
      "\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,\" he told the club's official channels.",
      "\"To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, since day one, we will start with our identity.\"",
      "On the heels of Amorim's first words as United boss was the now infamous 3-4-2-1 set-up. The three defenders, two pivot midfielders in between wing-backs behind a forward line of three, instantly came to define Amorim's United. In September 2025, Amorim said \"not even the Pope\" could change his approach to the game.",
      "Up until recently, his set-up had not changed, and fans and media alike questioned the former Sporting boss' ability to adapt after the approach bore very little fruit. It was an approach new to Old Trafford and its results did very little to inspire. A 15th-placed finish in the league and a Europa League final defeat were its offerings.",
      "While in game, naturally, roles would shift and change and, match to match, there were certain nuances that added difference, the three at the back was a fixture.",
      "In December, though, it was as if a switch had been flicked. As United managed a half-decent run of games, according to Amorim, it felt like the perfect opportunity to finally adapt.",
      "Somewhat forced to relent by Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo departing for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim rejected any notion that outside pressure was to blame for his newfound tactical flexibility.",
      "On Boxing Day, in the win against Newcastle, Amorim started with four at the back for the first time since his appointment.",
      "\"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim ahead of Tuesday's draw with Wolves",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, so we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.\"",
      "But against Wolves, it was back to basics for the Portuguese. A tactical reversion called a \"backwards\" step by Gary Neville as Amorim returned to a back three. But why did he change back, are Man Utd ready to move beyond the back three and what changes has Amorim made to his approach throughout this season?",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser was the first opportunity fans had to see some of the new signings in action. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha started with Mason Mount also named too.",
      "Cunha played centrally, with Mount in the left attacking midfield role and Mbeumo to his right. United finished the game with more possession and twice Arsenal's number of shots.",
      "An early set-piece and Altay Bayindir mistake was the cause of United's defeat but there were immediate signs of a change in attacking approach. United's wing-backs and a willing runner in Mbeumo were impressive as Amorim's side used every occasion they could to send the ball over the top and stretch Arsenal's defence.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: After an underwhelming spell of games following the promise of the Arsenal performance, which included a harrowing loss at Brentford, an under-pressure Amorim travelled to the champions in the hope of securing back-to-back wins for the first time in his Premier League tenure.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was on the bench, despite starting the previous two and United returned to a forward line consisting of Cuhha, Mbeumo and Mount. United took the lead after just two minutes through Mbeumo. His run was rewarded as United caught Liverpool cold with an Amad pass in behind.",
      "United won through an emphatic Harry Maguire winner. But with less possession, United showed a rare staunch defence that managed to keep Liverpool out despite their mounting pressure. The win ensured a first victory for Man Utd at Anfield for almost a decade.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"Every time you play in this environment, if you [low] block well, especially in the beginning, you can feel the fans turning.",
      "\"We feel that in our stadium. All the big teams suffer from that. We tried to do that. I think we have to have more possession to help our players. They struggled in the end. But a good win, let's focus on the next one.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Amorim's first real stark deviation from his three at the back led to one of the more chaotic and entertaining Premier League clashes in recent history.",
      "The personnel said 3-4-2-1 but the positioning disagreed. Leny Yoro's role as a \"secret right-back\" as Gary Neville dubbed it saw him wider and higher than usual. In a 4-2-4 at times, United were able to flow forward freely.",
      "In the first half, United produced the second-highest non-penalty xG of 2.49, most shots (17), and joint-most touches in the opposition's box, with 30, of any side in the Premier League up to that point.",
      "United's attack came to the detriment of United's defensive performance, but it was a showing that gained real plaudits. Amorim showed a flexibility he had not in the past and it appeared to get the most out of his playing squad on the night.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"A fun game. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work on. We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work on, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Full of confidence following on from the Bournemouth game, Amorim's tactical tweaks saw United impress again at Aston Villa. This fixture was the first without Amad and Mbeumo who had joined up with their respective nations for the AFCON.",
      "It was back to Amorim's tried and tested formation; however, United were full of energy, on the front foot and pressing high in another different take of Amorim's approach.",
      "Wing-backs Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot found great joy high and wide with Bruno Fernandes playing higher than usual too, in between Mount and Cunha, who had started in the 10s, behind Sesko.",
      "Fernandes' injury played a part, with Lisandro Martínez replacing him in midfield. That meant Manuel Ugarte stepped into the creative role.",
      "It was also one of United's more defensively secure performances of the six selected. United faced the second fewest shots on target among the selected games, winning possession the most and making the most recoveries. Unfortunately for Amorim, Morgan Rogers' sublime double, either side of Cunha's equaliser, was enough to beat United.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"I think we were the better team today. We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno, but during the game even without him, we were the better team. We did a very good job but no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: A pragmatic Amorim had more tricks up his sleeve as United returned home to face Newcastle. So much so, Eddie Howe seemed to rely on goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale going down in order to gather some tactical thoughts.",
      "Dorgu playing on the right wing was a curious move from Amorim but given the fact he stroked home the winner, any questioning was made obsolete. In the first half, United impressed with Cunha and Dorgu causing Newcastle huge problems.",
      "But the second half was cause for concern. United held on but Newcastle finished the game matching United's 1.2 xG and having 16 shots at Old Trafford to the hosts' nine.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger - to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: As United fell back into a three at the back, so did their predictability. After finding joy with a back four, United's lack of inspiration with a back three was telling.",
      "Amorim made just one change with Joshua Zirkzee replacing the injured Mount but United looked well off the pace. Zirkzee off the right managed to score but that would be his only highlight before he was hooked at half-time.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced by Jack Fletcher and the formation looked closer to United's 4-2-3-1 from the Newcastle win but still Amorim's side struggled to find openings. Wolves, who remain winless in the league, saw their xG trump United's at 1 compared to 0.8 for the home side.",
      "United perhaps did not get the points to show for their performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle, taking just four points, but they competed. Against Wolves, it was a far cry from that, raising the question as to whether United are even ready to evolve from Amorim's approach.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We struggled for the whole game. We had a lack of creativity but we knew that it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game also. If you look at the game, we had our chances, but the fluidity wasn't there because there is a lack of connections.",
      "\"The players tried. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball you struggle even without the ball. We need to recover and to go to the next one.",
      "\"We were running around trying to recover the ball. They overload with a lot of midfielders and we were struggling with that and sometimes you can attack better with less strikers. We played with three strikers, Cunha, Josh and Sesko, and sometimes it is not the best thing to attack well.\"",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across Saturday's games and is tipping BOTH Wolves and Burnley to win...",
      "Nottingham Forest's attacking output is wobbling and confidence is a fragile thing for sides built on structure and discipline. Teams coached in the Sean Dyche mould can be notoriously streaky going forward and it can work both ways as when belief dips, chance creation tends to dry up. Forest arrive in that exact space, scoring just once in their last three and struggling to consistently provide quality in the final third.",
      "That's a problem at Villa Park. Aston Villa under Unai Emery are ruthless and have won their last 10 matches at their home fortress. They can win again, without conceding, which is a 2/1 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Burnley's 10-game winless run jumps off the page and most will declare this a home banker at 1/2 with Sky Bet - but dig a little deeper and there are signs of life. Scott Parker has been proactive rather than stubborn, tweaking personnel and roles to try and spark something.",
      "He's found an exciting dynamic in his attack in the Marcus Edwards-Armando Broja pairing, who looked genuinely dangerous against Newcastle. Edwards' ability to receive between the lines and commit defenders gave Burnley a threat they've lacked for weeks, while Broja's power and direct can stretch a backline.",
      "Brighton look vulnerable again priced up as the odds-on favourites. They're six without a win themselves and games at the Amex have recently lacked the control and fluency that once made them so reliable. If Burnley play with the same attacking edge they showed last time out, this could quickly turn into an uncomfortable afternoon for the hosts.",
      "This has all the hallmarks of where a extraordinary run finally snaps.",
      "Wolves reaching the 20th game of the season without a win is the kind of unique run that rarely drags on forever. Football has a habit of correcting these extremes, especially when performances are starting to hint at a shift beneath the surface. And Wolves' recent displays suggest this isn't a team completely lost.",
      "The performances against Liverpool and Manchester United were quietly encouraging. Wolves competed, pressed with purpose and crucially, showed a level of bravery in possession that has been missing at times this season.",
      "West Ham are criminally soft when coming under pressure in games and Wolves may just need one moment to take advantage in what is likely to be an ugly affair. The home side to win by one goal looks a bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "It's currently impossible to build a credible case for Bournemouth against anyone in the Premier League, let alone the league leaders. Their defensive numbers have nosedived to worrying levels and the eye test matches the data. They look open, fragile and far too easy to play through. Conceding 2.25 goals per 90 across their last 12 matches is alarming on its own, but the expected goals against figure of 1.9 per 90 suggests this isn't bad luck, it's an underlying issue that has shown no signs of being fixed.",
      "Arsenal don't need many invitations to punish mistakes and Bournemouth are currently handing them out far too frequently.",
      "It's back to our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals that has landed in five of their last seven games.",

      "In failing to beat a team that had lost their last 12 games in all competitions, United missed the chance to move into the top four. Wolves' predicament remains grim, this just their third point of the season. But it was their night. And it is Amorim facing questions.",

      "There are extenuating circumstances, clearly. Manchester United are without some of their most creative players right now. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are injured.",
      "But when you draw at home to a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches in all competitions, there will be scrutiny. Particularly when Ruben Amorim switched back to his favoured back three to 'match up' with a side still winless in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim talked of the difficulty in relying on inexperienced players afterwards but he introduced one - Jack Fletcher - when removing Joshua Zirkzee, United's goalscorer, at the interval. \"It was tactical,\" he confirmed. They could not deal with Wolves' midfield, he argued.",
      "If that change was strange, the like-for-like substitution of Ayden Heaven - perhaps United's best outfield player again - for Leny Yoro was also difficult for supporters to understand. They booed that late switch, having booed the team off at half-time and full-time.",
      "Amorim remains confident, he insists, that United will be far stronger when his stars are back but the frustration is that the opportunity is being missed in the here and now. His team could have gone fourth with a better display against the bottom club.",
      "Five of the last seven games in which they have scored first have not been won. Home games against 10-man Everton, a woeful West Ham, a Bournemouth side they were beating three times and now this Wolves team, adrift in the table, have not been won.",
      "And the worry is that Amorim is a big part of the reason for that. The man in whom everyone is supposed to trust sometimes feels like a stumbling block to success rather than the architect of it. Leeds and Burnley await. Those games come with real risk now.Adam Bate",
      "Martin Odegaard's role in Arsenal's second goal against Aston Villa typified all he brings Mikel Arteta's side at his best. First, the off-the-ball alertness to pounce on Youri Tielemans' loose pass. Then a through-ball so perfectly measured that Martin Zubimendi didn't even need to break his stride.",
      "His starring performance at the Emirates Stadium came only three days after he performed to a similarly high level in the win over Brighton. It's a goal and an assist in two games for him now but those numbers do not tell the full story.",
      "After an injury-hit start to the season, the Arsenal captain finally looks back at something approaching his best form. He led Arsenal players for touches, final-third passes, chances created and shots on Tuesday night, his influence clear.",
      "For Mikel Arteta, it was only ever a question of time. \"He needed some consistency as well and some games,\" he said in his press conference. \"Obviously, he had two times the shoulder injury, then he had a big knee injury, and that takes a little bit of time.",
      "\"Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, and that he's affecting the game in a great way.",
      "\"I think he was very, very good today.\"",
      "His work on the ball against Villa was complemented by a familiar level of intensity out of possession. Odegaard contested more duels than any other Arsenal player and won possession the most times too. Only Zubimendi ran further than his 11.2km.",

      "They chanted his name throughout, a new song to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries, and roared with delight when he tackled former favourite Matheus Cunha. Mane played with energy and quality, just days after lasting the full 90 minutes at Anfield.",
      "It is the tactical flexibility that has impressed Rob Edwards. A more natural winger, he was moved inside midway through the game against Liverpool and had been lined up for a No 10 role at Old Trafford until Santi Bueno's withdrawal forced a change of plan.",
      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",

      "That edge has been missing at times this season, especially away from home.",
      "Where Nick Woltemade offers presence, structure and link play between the lines, Yoane Wissa brings a bit of chaos and directness. He runs the channels, pulls centre-backs wide and asks uncomfortable questions of defensive units that want to hold a compact shape.",
      "Against Burnley, that difference was obvious within minutes and Newcastle managed to score twice inside seven of them.",
      "Two goals in two starts, capped by a decisive contribution in the win over Burnley, has quickly thrust Wissa back into the spotlight.",
      "The early signs suggest Newcastle now have two different attacking profiles for different types of games.Lewis Jones",

      "Arsenal were excellent in the second period, of course, but they were also far fresher, with Villa having played out a similarly draining away game against Chelsea only three days earlier. They had gone to their limits to extend their winning run to 11 games.",
      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton boss David Moyes praised his squad, with specific reference to players like Nathan Patterson who came into the game short of regular minutes, following the 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Injuries to Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz for this fixture only added to their problems. Moyes said he was working with around 30 per cent of the squad after the game and he was right.",
      "Through a combination of international duty at AFCON and injuries, Everton are threadbare.",

      "Waiting for players to return isn't enough. The January transfer window could be arriving at the perfect time.Patrick Rowe",
      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has praised West Ham's spirit but that only takes you so far. Barring a few Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta moments, there needs to be more quality in this Hammers team, or 2026 is the year they go down.Sam Blitz",
      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-German are also thought to be tracking his development closely.",
      "The teenager has scored seven goals and contributed four assists in 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig this season.",
      "Diomande has started both of Ivory Coast's matches at AFCON and has two goals in five appearances for his country.",
      "Speaking to Marcel Schafer alongside a number of other reporters in September, the RB Leipzig managing director for sport held up Diomande as an example of a \"young jewel\" identified as part of the club's rebuild this season following such a disappointing season.",
      "After eight consecutive European campaigns, Leipzig missed out on continental competition for the first time since their ascension to the German top flight and the signing of Diomande from Spanish side Leganes reflected the need for a refresh.",
      "\"He definitely fits in the profile we are looking for,\" Schafer explained. \"Young, hungry and high potential. Even though he was just six months in Spain, he had really some impressive appearances in LaLiga and we looked for these kind of players.\"",
      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",
