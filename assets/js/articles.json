      "Mikel Arteta still wants to strengthen his left wing options - but must sell before he can do more transfer business. That leaves Arsenal facing the prospect of not making any more big money moves in this window unless they start to ship players out.",
      "The Gunners have already been linked with Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo while Arteta is a huge fan of Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze but both will not move to the Emirates unless there is a big last minute shift. Tottenham are now in pole position to land Eze with negotiations ongoing as they look to seal a £60m deal - £55m plus £5m in add-ons - but Palace are determined to stand firm and drive a good deal.",
      "That is currently out of Arsenal’s reach because they have a bloated squad with all their new £200m-plus worth of arrivals but they have so far struggled to get players out of the door with the spotlight on sporting director Andrea Berta to balance the books. Leandro Trossard is most likely to go at this stage as Brentford, Aston Villa and several foreign clubs have shown interest in the versatile forward who is now further down the pecking order. First team squad members Jakub Kiwior, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson did not even make the bench at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Teenager Max Dowman, 15, was at the game but was left out of the match day squad while Christian Norgaard had a small knock and Gabriel Jesus is recovering from a long term knee injury.",
      "Fenerbahce have shown an interest in Zinchenko who only has a year left on his contract while Porto and Stuttgart are interested in Vieira with the Gunners keen to do a permanent deal. Lokonga has also attracted interest while Kiwior is considering his options after falling down the pecking order despite an impressive finish to last season.",
      "Arsenal signed Noni Madueke from Chelsea for £52m but Gabriel Martinelli started the season at Old Trafford and there is a feeling that they would still like to bring in extra quality. But the interest in Eze did not progress because that would also block off the pathway for Ethan Nwaneri and Dowman getting first team opportunities.",
      "They must offload to do more deals in this window but if another move is to be done then a left winger would be the most likely.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho remains among the players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer. However, offloading the winger is proving tougher than expected, though, with Sancho understood to have rejected a pair of potential exits.",
      "Sancho remains among United's highest earners, and is reluctant to take a big hit on his wages. Frustratingly for United, the clubs most interested in a move are not high on the winger's own list of preferences. Roma and Besiktas are the clubs to express an interest. The latter are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought Sancho to Old Trafford back in 2021 but got the sack a few short months after that.",
      "According to reports on the continent, Sancho doesn't want to move to the Turkish Super Lig at this stage of his career. He is also believed to ave told Roma he doesn't want to join them in this window. Part of the issue with Roma, it has been claimed, is the club's reluctance to match Sancho's £250,00 wages. However, he is also said to be unconvinced by the prospect of a move to Italy.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who had an obligation to sign the winger if they finished high enough in the league. They were able to pay United £5m to escape that obligation, though, and the former Borussia Dortmund star is now back at Old Trafford.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League opener at Arsenal and has not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season. The number 25 shirt, which he wore for his last United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield, now belongs to Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Sancho isn't the only United fringe player being linked with a move away. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have also been sidelined by head coach Ruben Amorim, while Rasmus Hojlund was left out on Sunday despite featuring in pre-season.",
      "\"It is our player - we have to make choices,\" Amorim said when asked about Hojlund. \"We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside.\"",
      "AC Milan looks like the most likely destination for the Dane, who is no longer first choice after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. \"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" Milan sporting director Igli Tare told SportMediaset over the weekend.",
      "\"We're evaluating him these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable. We know we have to intervene in that position and that they must be players who can give something extra to this group.\"",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City look set to do battle in the transfer market for wantaway PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian has confirmed he is sure to leave the French capital this summer, having been frozen out.",
      "Donnarumma played a starring role for Les Parisiens as they won the Champions League last season, but after the arrival of French international Lucas Chevalier, his days in Paris seem numbered. Both the red and sky blue halves of Manchester are now supposedly interested.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are in need of a quality shot-stopper, with Altay Bayindir's flaws exposed in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal and Andre Onana making multiple mistakes last term. City, on the other hand, seemed to have found their No.1 for the future this summer in the form of James Trafford.",
      "But with Ederson set to leave, having been linked with Turkish side Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola remains interested in bringing in the 26-year-old Italian. Where Donnarumma will end up is unknown, but he has been involved in controversial transfer negotiations before, namely in 2017 when he re-signed with boyhood AC Milan, and rumours of a clause involving his brother arose.",
      "In 2017, a still-teenage Donnarumma had become AC Milan's starting goalkeeper and was considered one of the most promising shot-stoppers in Europe. With his contract up, he seemed destined to go elsewhere, with the likes of Juventus and Real Madrid waiting in the wings, but a drastic U-turn occurred.",
      "Although the player's agent, the late Mino Raiola, declared he would not re-sign at the San Siro, Donnarumma put pen to paper on a new deal until 2021, with some alleged interesting clauses insisted upon.",
      "It was reported at the time that as part of this new deal, Donnarumma's brother, Antonio, 27, who was also a goalkeeper playing for Asteras Tripolis, would have to be signed by I Rossoneri. This £1m transfer was completed just one day after the younger brother had penned his new contract.",
      "Antonio was paid roughly £850,000 annually, six times less than his younger sibling. However, AC Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, made headlines for rubbishing the existence of any clause in Donnarumma's new contract.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he admitted in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written.",
      "\"Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had played for AC Milan in his youth before moving on to Genoa, outraged some fans with his arrival. However, he released a kind-hearted message eight years ago after he made a move that was subject to contrasting reports and remains somewhat of a mystery.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" admitted Antonio, who currently plays for Serie C side Salernitana.",
      "After his deal expired, Donnarumma left for PSG in 2021 and now looks set for a new chapter. His brother, Antonio, also departed Milan four years ago, moving to Padova shortly after his sibling's exit, and ended up with his current outfit by way of Torino.",

      "The Premier League returned at the weekend – and with it so did the VAR controversy. Six teams picked up maximum points on the opening day, including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, who narrowly overcame Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "But it was the video assistant referee that has dominated the headlines once again, with a number of contentious decisions sparking debate online. Arguably the biggest talking point came during Chelsea's opener against Crystal Palace, which saw Eberechi Eze's free-kick ruled out for contravening one of the little-known rules of the game.",
      "One of the most talked-about decisions saw Eze's stunning free-kick ruled out by VAR. Eze struck a venomous effort from outside the box that was too powerful for Robert Sanchez and appeared to have given Palace a shock lead at Stamford Bridge early in the first-half.",
      "However, the celebrations were quickly halted as the goal was checked. The goal was subsequently ruled out to the incredulity of the Palace fans, with one of their players deemed to have stood too close to the Chelsea wall.",
      "Referee Darren England announced to the crowd: \"After review, away number six [Marc Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.\"",
      "Guehi was deemed to have been encroaching on Chelsea's free-kick wall - Moises Caicedo in particular - as per law 13 of the International Football Association Board. This law states: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1m (1 yard) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\"",
      "The match between finished 0-0, and viewers were quick to jump on social media to share their disdain at the early decision. One wrote: \"Just to be clear, that Eze freekick shouldn't have been ruled out. I would have lost my mind if we had a goal chopped off for that.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we had scored a freekick like Eze’s today and it was ruled out for the same reason my head would be on mars,\" and a third added: \"Palace were well and truly robbed earlier that Eze freekick should've stood.\"",
      "However, despite the uproar, according to the laws of the game the correct decision was made by VAR.",
      "In the first game of the new campaign on Friday night, reigning champions Liverpool took on Bournemouth at Anfield. Early in the first half, Cherries defender Marcos Senesi appeared to have handled the ball near the halfway line, after initially attempting to control it with his thigh.",
      "Without this intervention, Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike looked to be away through on goal unchallenged, leading to a barrage of comments online criticising what seemed to be a huge miss from VAR.",
      "One wrote: \"PGMOL an absolute laughing stock just 13 minutes into the new Premier League season as a blatant handball and red card ignored by VAR, despite the whole world watching Bournemouth’s Senesi deliberately deny Ekitike and Liverpool a chance to score.\"",
      "Another said: \"That was a clear handball by Senesi,\" while a third noted: \"How did senesi not get booked for that handball tho?\"",
      "However, the decision was checked by VAR at the time, and the Premier League Match Centre X account cleared up the confusion for social media users via a tweet posted minutes after the incident. It read: \"The referee’s call of no red card to Senesi was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed not to be a clear handball offence nor denial of a goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO), due to the distance from goal.\"",
      "In the same game, the Cherries were denied a chance to equalise on the stroke of half-time with the scoreline still a 1-0. When a ball was floated into the box towards Senesi, he headed it back across the area into the path of an onrushing Alex Scott.",
      "However, Alexis Mac Allister challenged for the ball and the pair ended up in a heap on the ground, with Bournemouth fans screaming for a spot kick. It is unclear whether the alleged foul was checked by VAR, but supporters were up in arms about the moment on social media immediately.",
      "Alongside a clip of the incident, one wrote: \"Penalty against Liverpool in the first half? Didn’t get a replay or even a mention of it at half time…\" Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett also believed Bournemouth should have been awarded a penalty.",
      "He said: \"Bournemouth had a real strong shout for a penalty kick when Alexis Mac Allister came in and clattered Alex Scott. It was a careless challenge, and as such, it is a foul. This should have resulted in a penalty kick to Bournemouth.\"",
      "However, nothing was given and Liverpool went on to win the game 4-2, despite a spirited Bournemouth fightback.",
      "In Aston Villa's goalless draw with Newcastle, Ezri Konsa left his team with 10 men for a good majority of the second half due to his foul denying an \"obvious goal scoring opportunity\". In the 66th minute of the game, a ball was clipped into makeshift striker Anthony Gordon, who was through on goal.",
      "However, Konsa pulled the England international back just beyond the halfway line, and received a red card for his troubles by referee Craig Pawson - which was then checked by VAR and confirmed.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre updated viewers on the decision, as they wrote: \"The referee’s call of red card to Konsa for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",
      "Fans were less irritated by this decision, with many agreeing that the referee and his video assistant on the sidelines had made the correct decision. One wrote: \"Hard to argue against the earlier Aston Villa red card.\"",
      "But despite having a man advantage for the best part of half an hour at Villa Park, the Magpies failed to capitalise and the two sides played out a 0-0 draw.",
      "Some Manchester United fans felt hard done by after their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal following an incident involving William Salbia and Matheus Cunha right at the death. In the final minute of normal time, the ball was crossed into the Portuguese midfielder when Saliba appeared to go through the back of Matheus, with footage showing the Frenchman's left foot connecting with his opponent's.",
      "Cunha went down but United's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Simon Hooper who allowed play to continue, before VAR concluded that it did not warrant a penalty.",
      "Regardless, the decision wasn't given on the field or by VAR and Arsenal held on to secure all three points on the opening day of the season at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres provided something to “build on” despite drawing a blank on his full Arsenal debut. Arsenal star Bukayo Saka insists that £64m striker Gyokores has got all the hallmarks of a top quality centre forward and is already settling into his new surroundings.",
      "Gyokores, 27, did not get a single shot on target and was substituted after making his first Arsenal start in the Premier League at Manchester United.",
      "It left many fans wondering about his match sharpness and fitness and the Sweden international has only managed two weeks of full training after his protracted switch from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyokores represents a big gamble for the Gunners as he was prolific at Sporting but has yet to prove himself in a top league and he is now in the spotlight at Arsenal.",
      "But Saka is convinced about his new team mate’s qualities and says Gyokores will be ready for the physical challenges of the Premier League. England winger Saka said: “I was impressed with him and he battled for us. It was tough. There was a big battle up there. I thought he did well.",
      "“His performance gives us something to build on and I am sure it will help him next week. He has slotted in well and so have the other guys.”",
      "Arsenal went on a big summer spending spree as they splashed out huge money on Gyokores, bought Martin Zubimendi for £51m and Noni Madueke for £52m.",
      "They also brought in Cristhian Mosquera, Christian Norgaard - who missed the United trip with a small knock - and reserve keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to strengthen their squad and suddenly their bench looks very strong.",
      "But it now remains to be seen whether they have enough X factor in their ranks to push Liverpool and Manchester City in the title race.",
      "The victory at Old Trafford was something of a statement and winning at United - without playing anywhere near their best - is a reason to be optimistic.",
      "Saka was searingly honest about Arsenal’s failings and knows they will have to improve against Leeds on Saturday and their next away trip is to Liverpool.",
      "Saka added: “It was not a great performance. We are happy with the three points, to come away from Old Trafford with a win. We were not up to our usual standards, the basics, sloppy giveaways. Our decision making was not great and that cost us and gave United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it but we cannot do it every game.”",

      "The first Premier League weekend of the season has been ticked off - almost. The 2025-26 season got underway over the weekend, and there have been thrills and spills already.",
      "Defending champions Liverpool kicked off the season in style with a 4-2 win against Bournemouth at Anfield thanks to two late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. Aston Villa and Newcastle battled to the first 0-0 of the season, while Brighton were held by Fulham.",
      "Tottenham and Manchester City opened the season with comprehensive victories against Burnley and Wolves respectively. Newly-promoted Sunderland also got off to the perfect start with a dominant win against West Ham.",
      "Controversy reigned at Stamford Bridge as Crystal Palace earned a point against Chelsea. Meanwhile, Manchester United's woes have continued with defeat against Arsenal.",
      "When Manchester City signed former AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for £46.5m, it looked like a good deal for a player who had scored 15 goals last season and was entering his peak years.",
      "That fee however now looks to be a real bargain following one of the best Premier League debuts of recent years. The Dutchman put in a real virtuoso performance in City’s 4-0 trouncing of Wolves at Molineux. He covered basically every blade of grass, showed excellent creativity and composure. And he even had the finish to open his goalscoring account for his new club with a well-taken strike.",
      "It’s not often you see a new signing take to a brand new league with such little effort but to come away with a goal and an assist represents an excellent return for Reijnders.",
      "So often last season City lacked a real midfield presence due to Rodri’s knee injury but Reijnders appears to be just the man to replace him at the Etihad. If he can keep up those levels, then there is no reason why he can’t be a key cog in another relentless trophy-winning machine under Pep Guardiola.",
      "It is hardly the biggest headline from the weekend, but it could mark a significant improvement. On Saturday, Martin Dubravka became the first victim of a new Premier League rule. Burnley were just three minutes and 13 seconds into their top-flight campaign when Dubravka got his hands on the ball against Tottenham, before quickly losing it again.",
      "Burnley's new goalkeeper held onto the ball for longer than eight seconds and therefore conceded a corner. The rule is designed to limit time wasting, which has become a scourge of elite football. Unlike many other changes to the game, this appears like a simple and easily applied one, which hopefully will have a positive impact.",
      "Unfortunately, it can't stop the more conventional method of time wasting, which serial perpetrator David Raya demonstrated against Manchester United the following day. The Arsenal goalkeeper took an age over every goal kick or free-kick and was finally booked late on at Old Trafford. Time wasting will no doubt continue in those situations and from throw-ins, but one avenue has at least been shut down.",
      "Going into the new season, some worried whether Pep Guardiola’s motivation was waning and a few even speculated he might not have long left as Manchester City manager. Now, though, it looks as though all he heeded was some shiny new toys to play with.",
      "Some ruthless finishing sent City top with a 4-0 win at Wolves, with two of those summer signings on target. Tijjani Reijnders stole the show, but Rayan Cherki’s cameo showcased a level of creativity that could really come in handy against tougher-to-break-down opponents.",
      "Not only that, but Oscar Bobb has made an early case for the ‘like a new signing’ badge after missing the bulk of last season through injury - with Rodri still to return.",
      "Yes, it’s worth recognising that City won their first four games last season before Rodri’s injury. But winning in this manner while still waiting for the Spaniard to take his place in the side will surely worry their rivals for the title.",
      "We can be guilty of not always realising just how good a foreign player is until they play in the Premier League and it looks as if Tijjani Reijnders might be the latest example.With Kevin De Bruyne no longer part of the furniture at Man City they've bought in the Dutchman, who was an instant hit on his debut during the win at Wolves. He was on the scoresheet, as was Rayan Cherki, who could be another massive hit.",
      "City's recruitment may not have seen them land the household names, but Reijnders could yet prove to be an absolute steal having joined from AC Milan for £42.5m.There's no doubt that those on the blue side of Manchester have gone under the radar, regardless of what the pundits say. Few have tipped them to regain their Premier League crown, but that may suit them as they embark on a new era under Pep Guardiola.",
      "My biggest takeaway from the opening weekend was Granit Xhaka might just be one of the signings of the season. While falling hopelessly headfirst into the trap of making judgements after one game, Sunderland’s incredible summer spending spree - in excess of £150m - gave them the energy to beat West Ham and the belief they can stay up.",
      "At the heart of that is former Arsenal captain Xhaka who now wears the armband at the Stadium of Light and, at 32, is the experienced leader a newly-promoted club needs.",
      "When the deal was first mooted, most fans were a bit surprised. He is swapping Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap but it actually shows ambition and determination.",
      "Sunderland’s was the best win of the weekend in my eyes. We desperately need one - hopefully two - of the newly-promoted clubs to stay up. It’s ridiculous that we keep seeing three up and three straight back down. It’s bad for the league.",
      "But a rocking, loud and raucous Stadium of Light is good for the Premier League. I did tip Sunderland to go down before the season started - but I so hope they prove me wrong.",
      "Plenty of players have come and gone this summer, and big hitters like Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah remain, but if you could guarantee Liverpool supporters that one star would stay fit throughout the season then plenty are going to say Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Redeployed at the base of midfield, the Dutchman started every game last season up until the point that the title was secured, but his red card on the final day against Crystal Palace meant that he was suspended for the opener against Bournemouth on Friday, and it showed.",
      "The Cherries were able to cut through the Liverpool midfield far too easily, and while more alterations and additions are expected in defence and attack in the remainder of the transfer window, getting Gravenberch back into his position as the midfield anchor is imperative for a Liverpool side who shipped 11 goals in six pre-season matches, including two in the Community Shield which Gravenberch missed as his partner gave birth.",
      "Liverpool will face a fiery welcome at Newcastle next Monday, and they're going to need their midfield lynchpin available.",
      "Are Arsenal going to play like this every week? If so then they will struggle to beat the big boys and finally land the title. They were hard to watch at Old Trafford. Yes they were defensively resolute but Roy Keane was right - why didn’t they look to kill off United?",
      "Martin Odegaard still looks off his best and that has to be a worry. So many counter attacks he ruined by making the wrong decision or misplacing a pass. Liverpool certainly looked defensively vulnerable but they were ruthless in attack on Friday night while Manchester City were clinical and calm in walloping Wolves.",
      "Arsenal looked sluggish and sloppy against an improved United but certainly not a title-challenging team from Old Trafford. It’s great to be good at set pieces but, my word, how long do they take over each one?",
      "Arsenal have the attacking talent to be explosive and exciting to watch but last season they were too often boring and drew too many games. If they repeat their Old Trafford performance against better teams than United then they will be doing the same again this season.",
      "So if you're an attacking player you can't be within one metre (or a yard) of a wall which has three or more defending players in it. Who knew? Well it seemed as though Marc Guehi didn't, judging by his reaction to referee Darren England when Eberechi Eze's goal was ruled out for Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "So learning a new law of the game might well be my biggest takeaway from the opening weekend. The challenge for the referees now will be to ensure that the rule is consistently applied, because surely this type of thing has happened before and not been punished?",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bayern Munich have failed with a loan bid to land Christopher Nkunku - which has been rejected by Chelsea as they seek to raise funds for their pursuit of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Manchester United winger is one of two forwards who are being eyed by the Blues - alongside RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons. And as a result they are not looking to sanction any temporary exits which has seen them reject the German's approach for the Frenchman.",
      "Those at Old Trafford are willing to sanction Garnacho's departure with the Argentine falling out of favour. The player himself is keen on a move away to reignite his career and sees Stamford Bridge as the ideal destination.",
      "However his move is contingent on a transfer merry-go-round that needs Chelsea to raise capital to continue their recruitment. As a result they have told Bayern, who want to bring Nkunku back to the Bundesliga, that they only want a permanent sale, reports The Times.",
      "Bayern remain interested in Nkunku as they need to bolster their attack following the sale Kingsley Coman to Al-Nassr on Friday. But given that they and Chelsea want two different deals, any movement is currently unlikely.",
      "Inter Milan are also thought to be interested in Nkunku, but again they have been told that they would need to pursue a permanent move. Leipzig previously considered an approach, but the player is not interest in a return to his former club given they not qualify for the Champions League this season.",
      "Nkunku has four years remaining on his contract after joining the Blues in the summer of 2023. He made a £52million switch from Leipzig after scoring 58 times in two seasons. At Chelsea though he's scored just 18 times in 62 games.",
      "United remain keen on sell Garnacho and are prepared for an offer from Chelsea. Any sale would be beneficial for those in Manchester as the Argentine, an academy graduate, would represent pure profit, which would aid their PSR figures.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another player they want to offload. He, like Garnacho, appears to have little future at Old Trafford currently but he's turned down a move to Roma. The Italians were willing to pay £17m but the winger is still waiting to review his options having been linked with several clubs.",

      "Nicky Butt believes PSR and a lack of city appeal are the two reasons Newcastle United have fallen short with transfers this summer. The Magpies have endured a chaotic summer while attempting to strengthen their squad for a fresh Premier League campaign.",
      "Top targets like Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko all chose different destinations despite a wealth of interest. While Newcastle have managed to land the likes of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest in a £55million deal and Malick Thiaw from AC Milan for £34.5m, plenty of supporters will feel let down by missed opportunities.",
      "This is particularly galling given that Newcastle will come up against several of their would-be signings this season when they meet the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City.",
      "While Eddie Howe has moaned that rigid PSR restrictions are \"controlling\" his team's capacity to compete in the current window, Butt claims that there's an additional element at work which might not go down well with the passionate Toon Army.",
      "Speaking to Chronicle Live via BetMGM, the midfielder, who turned out at St James' Park between 2004 and 2010, said: \"I think PSR will definitely come into play, and I think Eddie's such an experienced man, experienced manager and coach, he wouldn't put things out there that he's going to get thrown back in his face as lies.",
      "\"That'll be definitely a big part of it, but I think the thing with Newcastle is, until you're in the club, and unless you know about it... so I knew about it playing against them in the good old days, I knew what a big club it was, and how passionate the supporters were, and when I was going there I knew all about the football club.",
      "\"But some of the players don't know. They don't know how big a football club it is, don't know it's a one-club city, they don't really understand the dynamics of the demographic up there, and obviously it's not London. It's not one of the so-called shining light cities.",
      "\"Even though it's a city, it's not in that kind of elk. It's tough to get. Manchester had a bit for a long time to try to get players from London to Manchester United, it was tough because it wasn't the glamorous city that it probably is now.",
      "\"I think Newcastle are finding that and it's sad. You have to throw something at these players to make it more attractive, which is, you know, more money for some of the players, they get turned on by that. Obviously they're in Europe, in the Champions League and stuff now, so that helps.\"",
      "Butt also believes that Newcastle will be able to lure players who aren't simply chasing a hefty wage packet, and that the club will be capable of landing stars who genuinely fancy playing for Newcastle out of pure passion for the game. He added: \"But yeah, you have to try and get the right ones that want to be there, and I think the ones you lose anyway, in the long run you're better off losing them.",
      "\"Yes, I understand there's finances being involved, because no one's going to go to work at the building site down there for five hundred quid when they can and go and build this out there for five grand. You've got a family to look after, and you've got the rest of your life, so I get finances coming into play, but you've really got to want to play for a football club.\"",
      "It comes as the Magpies found themselves short of firepower when the fresh Premier League campaign kicked off on Saturday. Anthony Gordon was pressed into service as a makeshift No. 9 against Aston Villa due to Alexander Isak's continuing transfer uncertainty.",
      "While numerous supporters will be content with a point secured following a scoreless stalemate at Villa Park, others will be hoping to see Howe and the club's hierarchy move swiftly regarding bringing in a replacement for the restless Swede, particularly considering Gordon's minimal influence.",
      "Newcastle have reportedly set their sights on Brentford's star striker Yoane Wissa, who has hinted at his willingness to make the move up north. However, insiders at the Bees have made it clear that they won't let him go without securing a fitting replacement.",
      "The Magpies have also been linked with Paris Saint-Germain ace, Goncalo Ramos. However, the forward has pledged his loyalty to the Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future, leaving Newcastle to explore other options.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Italian giants are also interested in Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic but the clubs have reached a stalemate over the fee and his contract. That is the reason behind their interest in Manchester United misfit Hojlund but Milan still face a battle to convince the Denmark striker to give up on Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim admitted Hojlund was left out for his club’s opener with Arsenal and he must now choose whether to stay and fight for his place or leave.",
      "United are keen to do a deal to help balance the books after a £200m spending spree on a new forward line of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "It would mean taking a huge hit on 22-year-old Hojlund who joined from Atalanta for a staggering £72m in August 2023.",
      "However, Hojlund has struggled badly at Old Trafford and he is surplus to requirements but he may be reluctant to leave with United keen on a permanent deal - they want closer to £35m - but would also entertain a loan.",
      "Vlahovic has been Milan’s No1 target with Juventus ready to offload him but it now remains to been whether that deal could be reignited.",
      "There is a belief that Milan could ultimately prefer Vlahovic but have become frustrated in their attempts - and yet he is still a big option.",
      "That now also goes for Hojlund who did enough in Italy to convince United to sign him and that may help to persuade him to go back to Serie A with AC Milan.",
      "Meanwhile Roma are threatening to pull the plug on a £20m deal for Jadon Sancho. The Italian giants are keen on the Manchester United misfit but are ready to give him an ultimatum after becoming frustrated with negotiations.",
      "Sancho, 25, is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and a £20m deal has been agreed for a loan with an obligation to buy the England international. But Sancho’s £250,000-a-week wages have been a major sticking point as the winger does not want to take a financial hit.",
      "It would also appear by the long, drawn out negotiations that he has some reservations about moving to Italy and another loan move after joining Chelsea and former club Borussia Dortmund on loan during his nightmare spell at United.",

      "Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres got an immediate lesson in the challenges posed by the Premier League after his £64m summer move from Sporting Lisbon. The Swedish striker scored 54 goals in his final season in Portugal, but didn't even register a shot on his top-flight debut for the Gunners.",
      "It brings to an end a streak lasting some 28 months. Gyokeres registered at least one shot in every single one of his league appearances for Sporting, but failed to do so for Arsenal against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "You have to go back 69 games for the last time Gyokeres failed to register a shot in a league outing. According to BBC Sport, the game in question was Coventry vs Blackburn in the Championship, with the Sky Blues claiming a 1-0 win despite their leading man coming up short.",
      "Gyokeres was celebrating another 1-0 win on Sunday despite his personal struggles. Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game, capitalising on an Altay Bayindir error to nod home at the back post after a Declan Rice corner.",
      "Arsenal's new No.14 scored in pre-season during a win at home to Athletic Club. And, while he was made to wait in the league, manager Mikel Arteta recognised he wasn't the only one to find things tough.",
      "\"We came here away and won which is a big result. We were clearly not at our best,\" Arteta told Match of the Day. \"We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",
      "Arsenal's next game comes at home to Leeds United, who begin their own campaign against Everton on Monday night. Daniel Farke's side scored a league-leading 95 goals en route to promotion from the Championship last term so Arsenal may need to be at their best defensively once more.",
      "No team conceded fewer than Arsenal in last season's Premier League, with goalkeeper David Raya claiming the golden glove award. Raya needed to be sharp to snuff out a couple of United attacks on Sunday, but pointed to the team effort required.",
      "\"That's the willingness, the fight, the spirit that we have altogether, where things are not going our way and we make mistakes, everybody's sprinting back and trying to help the teammate that's made a mistake to recover the ball and to do the right thing,\" the Spaniard said. \"So we did that and I think we dug deep very, very well, especially the last 10-15 minutes where they threw everything to us and we defended very well, so that's credit to the team.\"",

      "Arsenal’s goal came from their first corner of the game as Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice’s cross over the line after Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball clear. Bayindir felt he had been impeded by William Saliba, but the goal was allowed to stand.",
      "The goal has seen a continuation of the debate over United’s goalkeepers, with Bayindir standing in for Andre Onana, who missed the game following an injury. Gary Neville felt Bayindir was at fault and needed to be stronger, but ex-Premier League referee Clattenburg had sympathy for the Turkey international.",
      "“In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal's goal,” he told United In Focus. “But when you watch it in slow motion, you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball. PGMOL said they would punish this type of challenge more, but again they failed.”",
      "His words echoed those of Ruben Amorim, who felt aggrieved that the goal was allowed to stand. He said: “I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Arsenal have become the masters of scoring from set pieces over the past few seasons and appeared to have identified United’s weakness. Saliba occupied Bayindir, who got a hand to Rice’s cross, but could only divert it into the head of an unmarked Calafiori at the back post.",
      "Neville has urged United to pursue Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is poised to leave Paris Saint-Germain. The ex-United defender believes the big personalities of the two keepers and their ability to cope with pressure would help his old club and Wayne Rooney agrees.",
      "Rooney said on his podcast: \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "However, Amorim insists he is \"happy with the three goalkeepers\" and added: \"I think we prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team. So I’m happy with the players.\"",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will hinge on whether Ruben Amorim brings in a new goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts. The Red Devils put on a vastly improved performance in their Premier League opener against Arsenal, despite suffering a 1-0 defeat.",
      "The Gunners found the net early in the first half through Riccardo Calafiori, after a blunder from keeper Altay Bayındır gifted the defender a simple finish at the far post. While United registered more attempts - both on and off target - and enjoyed better pass accuracy and completion rates, they failed to capitalise on this dominance for the remainder of the game.",
      "However, supporters will have been encouraged by Amorim's side throughout the first game of the 2025/26 campaign and the progress since the conclusion of last season.",
      "Ex-Newcastle legend Shearer hailed the performance of the Red Devils at the weekend, but issued a warning regarding their problem area between the sticks. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, the Premier League top scorer praised new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for bringing fresh energy into Old Trafford.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "At present, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton as their choice of shotstopper - yet neither Amorim nor supporters appear convinced by any of their options. Onana was regularly rotated with Bayindir during the previous campaign, with the pair conceding 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Onana failed to make the matchday squad for the opening fixture of the season, with 39-year-old veteran Heaton taking his place on the substitutes' bench instead.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma remains on United's wishlist, following his omission from the squad that travelled to face Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup last week.",
      "His deal in the French capital expires at the end of next season, meaning he could leave without a hefty transfer fee. Given the existing friction between player and club, it appears likely that the goalkeeper will exit Paris this summer for a reduced fee, though United's rivals Manchester City are currently frontrunners for his services.",
      "AC Milan's Mike Maignan is also on the Red Devils' radar as they consider a potential swap deal for young striker Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish forward has found himself out of favour with Amorim and looks set to bid farewell to Manchester this summer.",
      "In a surprising twist, it's been reported that David De Gea could make an unexpected comeback to United following the discovery of a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could see him depart for a cut-price fee.",

      "Arsenal skipper Martin Odegaard gave the perfect response to Tony Adams' recent calls for him to be replaced as club captain. That's after the Norwegian enjoyed a performance fitting of the lead man in Arsenal's hard-fought 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "The Gunners travelled to Old Trafford not long after club legend Adams suggested Arsenal are \"not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.\" The retired defender, who won four league titles with Arsenal and captained the team for 14 years, suggested the midfielder isn't the man to end the club's Premier League drought after three straight runner-up finishes.",
      "Speaking at a recent live recording of the Indo Sport podcast, Adams said: \"I'm seeing Declan Rice as a captain, but I'm saying to Arteta, 'Come on, step up now. It's your time to be a winning manager and a fantastic manager, because you're not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.'\"",
      "Odegaard has since responded to those comments and given some insight as to how he looks to inspire his squad. However, he saved the most apt reply for Sunday's trip to Old Trafford, where he delivered a leader's display under massive pressure.",
      "The 26-year-old played a crucial role in getting Arsenal out of several scrapes and firing his side upfield in numerous quick transitions. He also made five clearances - only William Saliba (seven) made more among Arsenal players - and did a good job of calming matters when United looked like unnerving their guests.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta has also come to his captain's defence after retaining Odegaard as skipper. He recently revealed the matter was decided by a club-wide vote, and there was a heavy consensus the former Real Madrid man was their pick to lead.",
      "\"My opinion is clear, and it's not just my opinion - it's all the staff and especially the players,\" Arteta told reporters ahead of Arsenal's Premier League opener. \"I asked them to vote [for] the captain, and I got the result yesterday.",
      "\"By a mile away, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody was choosing the same person, Martin Odegaard, which is the most clear sign that you can have. It's how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win, so there’s no question about that.",
      "\"There is [a vote] every year especially because we change [personnel] a lot, and we change the leadership groups, because a lot of the players that were there are now gone. So we need to re-establish that and because it gives you so much information, how they feel about themselves and how they see [the captain] as a leader. It was really interesting to analyse all the data and to gather information.\"",
      "Sunday's Premier League curtain-raiser is of course just the first step to Odegaard truly proving he's the man to take Arsenal to silverware. But victory away to one of the club's greatest nemeses on the opening weekend of the new season is no bad way to start.",
      "\"There's always these small things you have to do. In general it's just how I see it is to get the best out of the team and how to give the team the right mindset. Help the players around you, get the best mindset in everyone.",
      "\"I think before the game just on the pitch I do a little one (team talk) and inside the dressing room we have different people talking. It's not just me there's a lot of people sharing the responsibility and the manager does a lot as well. It's a shared thing. It's not just me all the time.\"",

      "There are just two weeks to go before the transfer window shuts, and plenty of Premier League clubs may feel they have work to do in the transfer maeket. Among them are reigning champions Liverpool, despite the Reds making a winning start to the season on Friday.",
      "Arne Slot's side have already spent big this summer, breaking the Premier League transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz. Their defensive issues came into focus during the win over Bournemouth, though, and Slot could be tempted to reinforce further.",
      "Last season's runners-up Arsenal looked more solid at the back on Sunday as they pipped Manchester United. It was a tricky afternoon for new striker Viktor Gyokeres, though, and the Gunners may feel they need to give the Swede more support.",
      "United themselves were able to take some positives from their performance if not the result. Questions remain for them, thoughm especially in goal after Altay Bayindir's struggles for Arsenal's winner.",
      "United's need for a new keeper became more acute when Bayindir flapped at a corner to allow Riccardo Calafiori to score Arsenal's winner at Old Trafford. Fellow senior keeper Andre Onana didn't even make the bench, despite head coach Ruben Amorim indicating the Cameroon international wasn't injured, and a new starting keeper could well arrive this month.",
      "Emi Martinez is one option, with the Aston Villa keeper absent through suspension this week, while Gianluigi Donnarumma's future might hinge on how serious rivals Manchester City are about a deal and Inter Milan could beat United to cheaper target Senne Lammens.",
      "Further forward, Amorim is certainly a fan of Carlos Baleba as United seek out defensive midfield reinforcements. Brighton won't let the Cameroonian leave on the cheap, though, so United may need to sell before they can buy.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are among those who could fetch a fee, with Roma keen on both, but it could be that the pair follow Toby Collyer by leaving on loan rather than permanently. Harry Amass has also been tipped to leave on loan, with Diego Leon's arrival leaving United in better shape down the left.",
      "There are three more out-of-favour players who could leave permanently to potentially bring in funds for a Baleba swoop. Alejandro Garnacho is wanted by Chelsea while Real Betis remain keen on Antony, and AC Milan target Rasmus Hojlund looks closer to an exit after being left out of the squad to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal have been busy already this summer, taking a focused approach under new sporting director Andrea Berta. They're only likely to add one more senior star, if that, but midfield creativity looks to be the order of the day.",
      "The development of Ethan Nwaneri has seen the Gunners cool their interest in Eberechi Eze, with Tottenham now looking the most likely to sign the Crystal Palace star. Arsenal could yet make a last-gasp move for the England international, but the priority right now appears to be cashing in on fringe players to raise some funds - even if they don't end up spending it all right now.",
      "With Gabriel Martinelli starting at Old Trafford and Noni Madueke coming off the bench, Leandro Trossard looks to be the odd man out. There has been well-documented Saudi interest in the Belgian, though he may yet wait for an offer from Europe.",
      "Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson all spent time out on loan last term and all three could yet move for the right price. Vieira has been eyed by Stuttgart, and all that remains is agreement on the price.",
      "Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko could also leave if the right offer comes in, with Fenerbahce chasing Zinchenko. We could also see a late summer exit for backup goalkeeper Karl Hein, with Tommy Setford promoted from the under-21s into the senior set-up.",
      "You might look at a team spending £300m and think 'surely they're done for the summer'. Liverpool have also brought in a sizeable sum through sales, though, and this - combined with their lack of spending 12 months ago - leaves some wiggle room.",
      "The defending for Antoine Semenyo's goals at Anfield suggests a new centre-back could be crucial. Giovanni Leoni arrived too late to feature in that game, and is still a teenager, so Marc Guehi could yet join from Crystal Palace.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, Alexander Isak remains more likely than not to join Liverpool after Newcastle left him out of their squad to face Aston Villa on Saturday. We're unlikely to see any additional incomings, but Liverpool could still cash in on some fringe players.",
      "Ben Doak was left out entirely on Friday, and is due to complete a permanent move to Bournemouth. Kostas Tsimikas looks the next-most likely to depart after being relegated to third choice left-back, with Nottingham Forest among the interested parties.",
      "Harvey Elliott could also leave for the right price after staying on the bench against Bournemouth, though Federico Chiesa's goalscoring cameo has seen talk of a departure for the Italian start to cool. There could also be some more loan departures after Luca Stephenson's move north of the border, with James McConnell and Lewis Koumas both in demand.",

      "Ruben Amorim has drawn comparisons to Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson due to his ruthless approach to team selection. Former Red Devils star Wes Brown made the observation after the Portuguese boss demonstrated his willingness to make bold decisions since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 home loss to Arsenal on Sunday. And there were reasons for the hosts to feel encouraged as United created the majority of clear-cut chances despite succumbing to Riccardo Calafiori's early header.",
      "New arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha played the full 90 minutes in their United debuts, while Rasmus Hojlund was omitted from the matchday squad entirely. Altay Bayindir, whose display came under scrutiny from Gary Neville following his role in Calafiori's opener, was given the nod in goal amid ongoing speculation surrounding Andre Onana's future.",
      "Amorim, 40, has demonstrated his readiness to make courageous calls since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November 2024. Sunday's team sheet reinforced Brown's earlier comparison between the current manager and club icon Ferguson.",
      "\"He's signed a few players who can play in different positions, especially those who have done really well in the Premier League. That's a massive thing, something we've missed.\"",
      "Brown, who made his Premier League debut for United in 1998, joined the club's first team during a period of change under Ferguson. The legendary manager had guided the Red Devils to glory with stars like Gary Pallister, Brian McClair, Lee Sharpe and Steve Bruce in the mid-90s, but wasn't afraid to bid farewell when he felt it necessary.",
      "Onana and Hojlund were brought to Old Trafford by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023 for a potential combined fee of around £115million. Both are rumoured to be on their way out of United this summer, although Amorim insisted on Sunday that Onana's absence was due to a lack of training and fitness.",
      "Bayindir's inability to command his area from an early Declan Rice corner once again highlighted the goalkeeping issues at United. Despite struggles in attack, Mbeumo and Cunha showed promise, while new signing Benjamin Sesko could only do so much in his brief 25-minute appearance off the bench.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all left out of United's first squad of the Premier League season. Each of the four is expected to leave the club this summer, further demonstrating Amorim's confidence in his decisions.",
      "Academy graduate and ex-United poster boy Marcus Rashford has been loaned to Barcelona in another big call this summer. January signing Patrick Dorgu also made a strong impression on United's left flank on Sunday, showing Amorim's influence is gradually taking shape at Old Trafford.",
      "The last two weeks of the summer transfer window could bring even more changes, with some marketable players still officially part of the squad. However, Amorim's refusal to include them despite the pressure of the Premier League resuming demonstrates a firm commitment reminiscent of Ferguson himself.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Michael Carrick has explained why Scott McTominay struggled to reach his full potential at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old signed for Napoli last summer, winning Serie A and the league’s Most Valuable Player award in his debut season.",
      "McTominay scored 13 goals and provided six assists in 36 games last term, becoming an instant hero in Naples. This was a far cry from the criticism he faced during his time at the Red Devils, usually when he was part of a midfield pivot alongside Fred, with the duo being labelled ‘McFred’.",
      "There were standout moments during McTominay’s last full season at Old Trafford, scoring 10 goals in all competitions and often finding the net at crucial times for Erik ten Hag’s side. While many fans were surprised by McTominay’s ascendency at Napoli, Carrick, who was United assistant coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, admitted that the midfielder’s ability was always evident, even though he was made to play a slightly different position.",
      "“He was always, yeah, we had a bit of a kind of few discussions with it about Scott when we were coaching with Ole and we played a lot with him and Fred and actually had a lot of good success in many ways with the two of them,” Carrick said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “More defensively, yeah, he could, he was kind of the box-to-box, if you like, done a bit of everything, but more defensive.",
      "“But he was reliable, he was a fantastic attitude, great to work with. But he always had, and in training, he always had an eye for goal. He was a great finisher. Getting in the box, and he had that, I never really had it, but with certain lads, getting around the box is just that extra bit of time to finish.",
      "“Like a [Frank Lampard], you know? I know Lamps was obviously best of the best of that, but he's got a sense of that, getting in the box, and it drops to him, like it's goals, he's just finding that.",
      "“And he always had it, and we tried a couple of times, and just because of the make-up with the team, it didn't quite work at that time, but there was always something in there where you think, he's got goals in him, Scotty.”",
      "“I'm so happy that he's gone to do well, because he deserves it,” Carrick added. “I'm sad that it's not at United, because I think he's kind of the one that you want at the club, because he just drives everything, he's a heart and soul, but to see him go on and do well, it speaks volumes, and there's no one taking that. He's had ups and downs, big ups and downs, and he's gone on, and actually he's not looked back now. It's incredible what he's done.”",
      "The Scotland international rose through United’s academy and became a first team regular under Solskjaer by 2019, going on to win the FA Cup and League Cup as well as reaching the 2021 Europa League final. He made 255 total appearances for his boyhood club and Carrick was asked why McTominay was not trusted in a more attack-minded role until leaving for Napoli.",
      "“Make-up of the team, the dynamics, whatever,” Carrick explained. “Look at England, you know, you've had it with England over the years. Why does it not work with England? Sometimes it's not an individual thing, it's a dynamic, it's the make-up of the group, it's the atmosphere surrounding it, that's what I'm saying.",
      "“It's not always just about that football or that game, there's kind of feelings around it sometimes that affect everyone's judgement, you know, it's not always as straightforward as that.”",
      "While Carrick argues that McTominay occupied a deeper midfield role to help the balance of the team, the player believes he was misunderstood after stepping up to United’s first team. The 28-year-old was willing to play any position asked of him and backed himself to be more consistent than some of the club’s marquee signings, but this selfless attitude arguably prevented him from finding his best position in the United team.",
      "“When I got into the first team, I was quite misprofiled in where I was playing,\" McTominay told The Athletic in April. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there.",
      "\"But I was being used as a number six or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game. But when you're playing for Manchester United and you're 20, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at number eight ahead of Paul Pogba. It's not realistic.\"",
      "\"You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do,\" McTominay added. \"In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.",
      "\"They would always sign someone who wouldn't necessarily be what people expected them to be. My mentality was that I was always there, ready to go, ready to take my opportunity. I always wanted to prove my worth, to show I could play every game. It's not the sort of thing that affects me. You can only be in control of what you do.\"",

      "Bayindir started with Andre Onana not in the squad following a pre-season impacted by injury, while 39-year-old Tom Heaton was on the bench. Neither Onana nor Bayindir has convinced since joining the club and Neville was clear on his take.",
      "Speaking later on the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: “It’s a glaring issue at United that cannot be ignored and that is that they do need to find a goalkeeper. They have to, I’m absolutely unequivocal on that.",
      "\"In my 20 years at Man United we had two periods of seven or eight years with [Peter] Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and in between we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it’s really unsettling when you don’t have a dominant No.1 who is 6ft 2in, dominant in the air and owns his six-yard box and comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves one-on-one and saves you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "“I don’t know where they are on PSR, they seem to have a bit more money, they don’t need to magic up a bit more money in the next week or so, or do something on loan.”",
      "But asked if he was happy with his goalkeepers, Amorim was firm. “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal, and we were the better team,” he said.",
      "And pressed on whether they might try to sign one before the window closes in two weeks’ time, Amorim simply stated: “I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",
      "United have enquired about Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer and Neville believes either would be a big step up. “The two that you’d look at who were mentioned in the last week are Martinez and Donnarumma,” he said.",
      "“The reason I say that they would be good goalkeepers for Manchester United is not necessarily because I think they are the best goalkeepers in Europe or that they’re amazing, I think they’ve got big personalities and characters. You’ve seen Donnarumma in that European final for Italy save those penalties, he looked like a giant. You’ve seen him play for PSG in huge games under pressure.",
      "“You’ve seen Martinez play in a World Cup final and win a World Cup. They’ve played under extreme pressure and have big personalities and characters and almost walk out with an arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper and I think Man United need that.”",

      "Patrick Dorgu hit the post in what was one of United's 22 efforts on goal with their new look attack causing numerous problems. Arsenal's defence held firm though and, like Liverpool and Manchester City, they begin the year with three points.",
      "Arteta admitted that Arsenal now leave Manchester with a feeling of dissatisfaction despite their win, which completes a huge turnaround given that Old Trafford was rarely a place they enjoyed success. Before Arsenal won their in 2020 they hadn't won a league game on the red side of Manchester for 14 years.",
      "Now Sunday's win marks their second win in their last three visits and Arteta said: \"Massive [to get the result], to come here with the atmosphere and the new signings. We have to be humble about how we scored the goal and game are won in both boxes which is what we did today.\"",
      "\"I look at the players faces and they want much more. We know that we are much better than certain moments we played. I think before I came here it was 18 or 20 years since we won at Old Trafford but now we come here and win many times and still unsatisfied. We need to be careful against a team who has the speed in the front line to threaten in that way.\"",

      "United eventually slipped to defeat, with Riccardo Calafiori’s first-half header securing victory for the Gunners. That result will not have helped Scholes’ mood following a difficult first few minutes.",
      "His daughter Alicia, 24, filmed her Dad’s reaction as she walked into the lounge wearing an Arsenal shirt. And Scholes, 50, had a blunt response to her choice of attire, quickly saying: “Take it off.”",
      "She quickly turned down that request. Alicia is one of three children that Scholes shares with wife Claire Froggatt. They also share 25-year-old son Arron, as well as Aiden, 20.",

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

      "Dressing room sources say the players believe they made clear strides with their performance against Arsenal, who came second in the Premier League last season and reached the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "A second source said the squad felt the performance was \"much better\" than how United fared in the majority of their home matches last season.",
      "United had 61% of possession and 22 attempts at goal, with seven on target - more than twice as many as Arsenal managed.",
      "Left back Riccardo Calafiori's 13th-minute header decided the contest after a blunder by error-prone back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "The result marked United's 19th defeat at Old Trafford since the start of the 2023-24 season and Amorim has reached 15 defeats faster than any Premier League manager, excluding those in charge of newly-promoted clubs, since Paul Hart in 2009-10.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year,\" Amorim said after the Arsenal match. \"We sprint more, we were more brave, we let one against one all the game. We pressed high.",
      "\"And then with the ball, we have quality. Even when the stadium makes some sounds, we continue to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up, compared to last year, [when] we struggled a lot.",
      "\"And then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season, that players like [Matheus] Cunha, like Bryan [Mbeumo], in one moment can elevate the stadium. So, I think the most important thing, we were not boring.\"",

      "Manchester United did not deserve to lose against Arsenal and it might have been a different story if Altay Bayindir had not started.",
      "Andre Onana has been recovering from a hamstring injury but had three training full sessions under his belt. Onana was omitted from the squad and Amorim decided to start Bayindir in his absence.",
      "Once it was decided Onana was not ready to feature, Bayindir was a guaranteed starter, but a large portion of supporters would have preferred to see Tom Heaton given a chance instead.",
      "In a tense post-Arsenal press conference, Amorim was asked whether he considered starting Heaton and he snapped back: \"Why? He [Bayindir] suffered a goal like this where?",
      "\"Without VAR. With VAR [at Tottenham], is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and will let the ball pass.\"",
      "In a way, it was admirable for Amorim to staunchly defend his goalkeeper in a short press conference, although he must privately concede that Bayindir is not good enough and should not be starting games for United.",
      "Bayindir is not aggressive enough at corners and fails to command his area. He made the same mistake against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in December last season and struggles to claim aerial deliveries.",
      "The Turkish international is meek when set-pieces are taken. And if that wasn't bad enough, he attempted to clear the corner with his left glove, which was the wrong hand to punch the ball with.",
      "From a technical standpoint, it was a shocking mistake from Bayindir and it cost United on the opening day of the Premier League season. Amorim gave Bayindir a second chance after a similar mistake against Spurs, but it's obvious to anyone with eyes that he needs to be replaced as second choice.",
      "Heaton has been underused during his second stint at his boyhood club. He is no spring chicken at 39 years old, but would he have conceded from that corner? It seems unlikely Heaton would have been so passive.",
      "Amorim seemed offended to be asked whether he'd considered Heaton to start against Arsenal, however, most would agree he would be a better option when Onana is unavailable to start.",
      "Bayindir is so unconvincing that he even skewed a simple pass to Bruno Fernandes when United were frantically trying to launch the ball forward in the final seconds of added time.",
      "The good news is that Onana is set to be available to start against Fulham at Craven Cottage this weekend. It says a lot about Bayindir that fans are desperate to see Onana play again when he starts instead.",
      "Amorim must rethink his cup competition policy of giving opportunities to Bayindir because he will continue to cost United this season.",
      "In an ideal world, Bayindir would be offloaded before the transfer deadline and a new goalkeeper would be signed to challenge Onana.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",

      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",
      "Amorim was coy on Rasmus Hojlund's future after he was omitted from the matchday squad. United are looking to sell Hojlund two years on from buying him from Atalanta in a £72million deal.",
      "\"He’s [got] to fight for the place,\" Amorim explained. \"We are going to see what happens in the market. [He has] different characteristics and Rasmus has the same characteristics as Benjamin Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, August 18th 2025.",
      "United’s Premier League season got up and running with a narrow defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started the match while Benjamin Sesko’s debut came as a second-half substitute, but Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal took all three points back to London.",
      "United continue to look for new faces to add to Ruben Amorim’s squad, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by the head coach thought to be on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton comes after it was reported that a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, with United relaxed about the situation and happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "There is also the small matter of sales to discuss with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has been linked with a surprise switch to Fulham.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford from RB Leipzig this summer has seen Hojlund fall out of favour at United. The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Fabrizio Romano, who specialises in transfers, has claimed that Napoli have made contact with United over a potential loan deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The former Atalanta forward scored just 10 goals across all competitions in 24/25 and looked devoid of confidence for much of a difficult season.",
      "He was left out of Ruben Amorim's squad for Sunday's defeat to Arsenal and faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Napoli had direct contact with Man United today following Romelu Lukaku’s injury as he’ll be out more than 3 months.Napoli asked for loan deal conditions for Rasmus Højlund.Man United want to keep Joshua Zirkzee, no talks despite links today. Clear plan by Rúben Amorim. pic.twitter.com/mOIiM1xqxW",
      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has received a response from Carlos Baleba on social media.",
      "United are reportedly interested in a swoop for Baleba this summer, as they aim to boost up their midfield before the transfer window shuts on September 1. The Seagulls reportedly value their midfielder at over £100million, with some reports hinting at a price tag closer to £120million.",
      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer. Despite that, the midfielder continues to be linked with a high-profile move to Old Trafford, although any potential transfer is unlikely to materialise until next year.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham are all reportedly targeting a move for Brentford captain Nathan Collins.",
      "The Daily Mail claim that interest in the 24-year-old centre-back is surging – although the Bees may well be highly reluctant to sell. It is claimed that United are keen on adding another defender and Collins may be the perfect candidate.",
      "If Manchester United needed proof that they've signed the right players this summer - Sunday's performance against Arsenal offered some positive indications.",
      "Time will tell if Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo go on to have successful careers at Old Trafford. The new double act were still part of a United side which slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal in their opening fixture of 2025/26.",
      "There was also a worrying repeat of United's inability to convert their chances, with Ruben Amorim hoping that Benjamin Sesko will fix that gaping hole in his team. And yet the Reds' overall performance against a likely Premier League title contender offers some room for optimism.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Ruben Amorim have praised Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha's early impact at Manchester United.",
      "The pair arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford and Wolverhampton Wanderers respectively in big-money deals this summer. Their signings were made with United looking to bolster an attack which scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Neither player was able to get onto the scoresheet for Ruben Amorim's side during Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at M16. However, both played well in their first competitive game for the Reds with United overall putting on a much improved showing compared to what was often seen for much of last season under their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Read more here",
      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Manchester United have begun the 2025/26 season with a glaring weakness they are still some way short of solving.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side impressed in their 1-0 defeat against Arsenal on Sunday with United's new signings offering a positive impression. Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo provided glimmers of hope for the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "United pressed impressively, looked more creative and did not let their heads drop after Altay Bayindir's inexplicable goalkeeping error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to put the Gunners ahead. And yet a costly mistake from their keeper has cost Amorim's team once more in a game where they deserved much more.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Gary Neville has raised concerns over Manchester United's goalkeeping situation after a mistake from Altay Bayindir against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "The Turkish shot-stopper flapped at a corner and Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori headed in from a yard out. It continued a worrying trend for Bayındır who was at fault for several goals last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle.",

      "Sky Italia report that AS Roma have held positive discussions with Man United regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere dello Sport present a different view, stating that Sancho is taking 'a few more days' to decide on his future.",
      "The outlet adds that Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini spoke with the 25-year-old, explaining how he could become a key figure in the squad and replicate the form he displayed during his peak at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "It’s also reported that United and Roma have agreed on an initial loan deal, with an option to buy set at €25m (£22m).",
      "Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes Arsenal's goal against Man United should not have stood and that the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL) 'failed' to come to the correct verdict over the incident.",
      "United began their season with a 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, with Riccardo Calafiori scoring the only goal of the match. Despite the loss, United put on a productive display for the home crowd and created several goalscoring opportunities. The improvement was clear, but Clattenburg believes the scoreline could have been different. For Arsenal’s goal, William Saliba seemed to wrestle with Mason Mount, preventing Altay Bayindir from properly punching away the cross.",
      "\"In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal’s goal, but when you watch it in slow motion you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball,\" the former referee said. \"PGMOL said they would punish more this type of challenge, but again they failed.\"",

I don't know where they are on PSR [the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules], but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan. The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters. You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina. They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.\"",
      "Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club's interest in Hojlund this summer.",
      "\"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" he said. \"We’re evaluating him in the coming days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.",
      "\"We know we have to intervene in that position, and we also know they have to be players who can bring something extra to this group.\"",

      "Manchester United could still sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"The situation involving Emi Martinez has gone completely quiet. But a goalkeeper they still like and are still keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"Very talented goalkeeper, Belgian and United have been monitoring him for a long time. I told you about this interest in July and the beginning of August. This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\"",
      "As expected, Garnacho was nowhere to be seen at Old Trafford for Sunday's game amid ongoing uncertainty over his squad. Despite his threat, there doesn't seem to be dissatisfaction within the fanbase over his exclusion.",
      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",

      "The possibility of including Joshua King in the deal is also rumored.",
      "Man United have previously been linked with an interest in RB Leipzig attacker Simons, who has impressed for both club and country in recent seasons.",

      "United enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and were hopeful of starting the new campaign with a victory, but Arsenal left Manchester with a 1-0 victory after a Riccardo Calafiori goal.",
      "However, Fernandes was hesitant to say the result was unfair. \"I wouldn't say unfair, but I obviously think we came up a little bit short today,\" he said during a post-match interview with MUTV. \"Overall, we did something else to deserve a different result. It's very difficult to see the positive things when you lose the game, but we need to look forward and see next week what we can improve after this game. We will look at what we didn't do so good and what went wrong.\"",
      "When asked about the support from United fans throughout the game, Fernandes added: \"It was brilliant. Like I just said in a previous interview, they talk about hope in the team for what we did and everything.",
      "\"When I finished the game, what gave me hope for the season being very good for us and positive was the way the fans reacted. When we came around and came into the tunnel, they gave us hope with that. The next game is very important for us to give something back.\"",
      "The Sun claims that David De Gea is one of the goalkepers under consideration by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report states that the Spaniard has a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to return to the club at a reduced fee. United have just two weeks to strengthen their goalkeeping department this season, with Onana facing heavy scrutiny for his performances both last season and over the summer.",
      "He was left out of Amorim's squad for their Premier League clash with Arsenal. After the game, the Portuguese boss said: \"He's not injured, he's recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.\"",

      "Man United are far from sanctioning an exit for Sancho amid interest from AS Roma, claims TEAMtalk.",
      "United have reportedly verbally accepted a £20million offer from Roma for the winger, but reaching an agreement with the player is expected to be challenging. TEAMtalk understands that the main obstacle is Sancho’s wage demands.",
      "He currently earns £250,000 a week at United, with a contract running until next summer.",
      "Roma coach Gian Piero Gasperini is personally trying to persuade Sancho, but the player has reportedly shown no willingness to lower his salary for the move.",
      "Man United are reportedly trying to sanction a sale for Rasmus Hojlund before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Rasmus Hojlund [was] out of the squad and we know that Manchester United are trying to find a solution for him. They want Hojlund to go.",
      "\"They want to sell Hojlund as soon as possible. If a sale is not going to be possible, they want to do a loan with an option to buy – €6m loan fee, an option to buy around €40-45.",
      "\"So negotiations will now follow for Hojlund, with interest from AC Milan and more clubs around Europe, not only Milan.\"",
      "If Man United maintain their interest, they may face a lengthy queue of suitors ready to make an offer next year.",
      "According to The Athletic, Brighton acknowledge that, given the timing and the likelihood of a bidding war, this would be the ideal moment to sell.",
      "Hurzeler, who was asked about what he is looking for from Baleba this season, told reporters: \"Making the next step - getting more mature in decision-making, getting more mature regarding game management, being more consistent in the performances that we expect from him.\"",
      "If he hits those targets, Baleba is set to become one of the standout transfer stories of the summer 2026 window.",
      "Besides interest in Jadon Sancho, AS Roma have reportedly also made contact for Malacia.",
      "Taking to X to provide an update, Fabrizio Romano wrote: \"During talks with Man United for Sancho (no green light yet from Jadon), Roma also ask for Malacia deal conditions.",

      "According to the Daily Mail, Man United are among three Premier League clubs showing interest in Brentford centre-back Nathan Collins.",
      "Reports suggest that interest in the Irish defender is 'surging,' though Brentford are expected to resist any attempts to lure him away. For United, however, any new signings are likely to depend on player departures from the current squad.",

The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",

      "The young forward will get a good look at his potential new team when United travel to Craven Cottage on Sunday (4:30pm kick off UK time). While any chance of him featuring against Marco Silva's side is extremely unlikely, he will be able to assess what Fulham could offer.",
      "Silva's men began the new season on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion and needed a stoppage-time equaliser to rescue a point.",

There could yet be a redemption arc in English football for a player who has often looked out of his depth during a turbulent period at M16.",

      "Manchester United's new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave plenty of reasons for United fans to be positive about this season, despite Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "That is the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder and BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy who felt the pair gave United an extra physical edge at Old Trafford compared to last season.",
      "United signed Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, while Mbeumo arrived in a deal that could reach £71million from Brentford.",
      "The pair scored 37 goals between them last season and while neither found the net against the Gunners, their overall performance has given Murphy reason to be positive about United's prospects this season.",
      "\"They are more dynamic, more direct, more confident,\" Murphy told Match of the Day. \"Physically, they looked really good and I think a lot of that comes from having players high up the pitch, especially the two new boys (Cunha and Mbeumo) who are just high in quality.",
      "\"It is like chalk and cheese (to last season). Man United fans, I think, can actually be quite positive about this.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, when asked about where United still need to strengthen, Murphy was clear a midfielder has to be the club's top priority in the transfer market.",
      "\"Some might think a goalkeeper, but I probably think a central midfielder if you are going to play Bruno Fernandes in there,\" Murphy added.",
      "\"Someone a bit more powerful than Casemiro and Ugarte, someone who can do a bit of running for him.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 in their opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hoping to start the new campaign with a positive result, but Arsenal opened the scoring at Old Trafford in the 13th minute after a mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "Bayindir failed to properly connect with the corner and Riccardo Calafiori was gifted an easy header at the back post. United responded well and created enough chances to equalise, but a breakthrough proved elusive.",
      "Here are the talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed:",
      "Arsenal analysts were not happy",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "Gabriel Martinelli overhit a simple pass to Martin Odegaard on the counter-attack, much to the relief of Amorim on the sidelines, but the Arsenal analyst did not hide his frustration at the move breaking down.",
      "The pair also looked unhappy when Arsenal were dispossessed near the end of the first half. United created enough chances to be level by the interval and Arsenal were only leading due to Bayindir's shocking error.",
      "The frustration proves Arsenal were not good enough on Sunday afternoon, and they were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Same old story",
      "There was a melee in the box with just a few minutes to play. United were desperately trying to score an equaliser and committed bodies forward, but it just wouldn't go in for them.",
      "Benjamin Sesko turned his effort over the bar, high into the Stretford End, and Amorim responded on the touchline by placing his hands on his head. United have spent close to £200million on their attack this summer, but the same problem existed against Arsenal: they couldn't score.",
      "Having said that, United were the better side. There were signs of progress and positives to take, despite an opening day defeat.",
      "Cunha the crowd favourite",
      "Matheus Cunha made an immediate impact in the dressing room after his arrival from Wolves. The Brazilian is a huge personality and is a stereotypical fiery South American, so it always seemed likely he would become a fan favourite.",
      "And Cunha took the first steps to earning fan favourite status against Arsenal. He looked dangerous and roared at the crowd just before the hour mark after a scrappy physical battle with William Saliba.",
      "The 26-year-old won the ball near the tunnel by the Stetford End corner, fighting aggressively against Saliba. He reacted by vigorously first pumping to the crowd, who lapped it up. Cunha plays on the edge and he helped to whip up the crowd as United pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Cunha has the quality to back up his behaviour. He delivered an impressive performance on his competitive Old Trafford debut and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.",
      "What did Amorim expect?",
      "Amorim decided to play without a recognised striker against Arsenal. Sesko was ready to start the game, but he was named on the bench and Amorim's front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Cunha was fluid.",
      "Those three players took turns to play down the middle and regularly rotated positions, but the downside of that selection was seen in the first half when Diogo Dalot pulled a ball back into the box and nobody was there.",
      "Amorim was spotted shouting at Mount, who was positioned outside the box, but what did United's head coach expect? He shouldn't have been surprised to see Mount fail to think like a striker.",
      "Sesko was eventually introduced to the game in the 65th minute. The Slovenia international struggled to get into the contest, but it might have been a different story if he'd been included in the starting team.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Avram Glazer was spotted in the directors' box. The 64-year-old last made an appearance at Old Trafford for the opening game of last season against Fulham and showed his face again for the visit of Arsenal.",
      "The 1958 had planned to stage a protest against the club's ownership before facing Arsenal, but they decided to postpone the demonstration after surveying fans about whether it should go ahead.",
      "Whether that had something to do with Avram Glazer attending the game is up for debate. The American co-owner has deliberately made limited appearances in Manchester over the last few years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was among those seated n the directors' box. The striker was dropped from the squad and is being ruthlessly shown the door by Amorim after taking huge backwards steps last season.",
      "JJ Gabriel was also seen in the directors' box against Arsenal. The youngster is just 14 years old, but there is a buzz at United about his potential and the invite to watch the game shows how highly he is regarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice's cross into an empty net in the 13th minute after United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball away.",
      "Replays of the goal showed William Saliba in close proximity to the goalkeeper near the goal line but the goal stood. Bayindir flapped at the corner to allow Calafiori a free header, similar to one he conceded at Tottenham last season.",
      "\"It's going to keep hurting United, the goalkeeper has got to be stronger,\" Gary Neville said in his analysis of the goal. \"He'll complain that he's been fouled, there's a player in front of him, there's a lot of pushing and shoving.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper has to be stronger, get that player out the way, Saliba hasn't got his hands up, I don't think he's done anything at all. It goes through his hands, it's definitely a goal, he's just not strong enough. The delivery is sensational and they just don't deal with it.\"",
      "Roy Keane seconded Neville's verdict, insisting that Bayindir should have done much better. \"Of course (needs to be stronger). Fair play to Arsenal, it's a great delivery and they're attacking it but if you're the goalkeeper just take control of the six yard box.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Goalkeepers and defenders complain all the time about players being in their face, you get in their face, take control of that six yard box. Complain all you want but the goalkeeper, be aggressive, it's your area, come with violence take control of it. Arsenal are very good at it but United [are] weak and soft.\"",
      "There had been calls that Bayindir was the subject of foul play from Saliba with some suggesting the goal should have been disallowed. However, Gallagher has rubbished these claims.",
      "Jay Bothroyd, who joined Gallagher on Ref Watch, said Bayindir should have gone down if he thought it was a foul. Bothroyd added: \"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City are reportedly set to go head-to-head in the transfer market for PSG's unsettled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The Italian has already made it clear he intends to leave the French capital this summer after being frozen out. Donnarumma was a standout performer for Les Parisiens during their Champions League triumph last season, yet the signing of French international Lucas Chevalier has seemingly pushed him towards the exit.",
      "Now, both the red and blue sides of Manchester are believed to be circling. Ruben Amorim's squad urgently need a dependable presence between the posts, with Altay Bayindir's shortcomings highlighted in their narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, and Andre Onana guilty of repeated errors throughout the previous campaign.",
      "City, in contrast, looked to have secured their long-term solution earlier this summer by re-signing James Trafford. However, with Ederson tipped to depart and strongly linked with a switch to Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola is reportedly keen on recruiting the 26-year-old Italy international.",
      "Where Donnarumma will end up isn't known, but the keeper he is no stranger to dramatic transfer sagas - most notably in 2017 when he renewed at AC Milan under controversial circumstances, with speculation over a contract clause involving his brother.",
      "Back in 2017, Donnarumma was still a teenager but had already cemented his place in Milan's first team, widely regarded as one of Europe's brightest young talents. With his deal expiring, he looked set for a high-profile move, with Juventus and Real Madrid monitoring him closely, before he made a surprising U-turn.",
      "Although his agent at the time, the late Mino Raiola, publicly claimed he would not extend his stay at San Siro, Donnarumma ultimately signed fresh terms until 2021 - reportedly with unusual conditions attached.",
      "Reports suggested that as part of the agreement, Milan were required to sign Donnarumma's older brother Antonio, then a 27-year-old goalkeeper with Asteras Tripolis. That £1m deal was finalised just a day after the younger sibling committed to his new contract.",
      "Antonio earned around £850,000 annually, roughly one-sixth of Gigio's salary. Still, Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, dismissed rumours of any binding clause.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he explained in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written. Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had previously been part of Milan's youth system before moving to Genoa, split opinion among supporters with his return. Yet he issued a heartfelt statement following his signing, which drew mixed reactions and still carries an air of intrigue.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" said Antonio, who now represents Serie C outfit Salernitana.",
      "After his Milan contract expired, Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021 and is now on the verge of another move. Antonio also left the Rossoneri in 2019, transferring to Padova before later joining Torino and eventually finding his place at Salernitana.",

      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: \"The situation involving Emi Martinez has gone completely quiet. But a goalkeeper they still like and are still keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"Very talented goalkeeper, Belgian and United have been monitoring him for a long time. I told you about this interest in July and the beginning of August. This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: There is still time for the club to sign a new goalkeeper in this transfer window, especially after Altay Bayindir's performance against Arsenal. While not entirely at fault, he should have done better in clearing the ball away from Arsenal players in the box. Amorim’s decision to leave Andre Onana out could suggest that the Portuguese manager is not fully convinced by his performances in training, leaving the door open for a potential new signing between the posts.",
      "Sky Italia report that AS Roma have held positive talks with the Reds regarding Sancho.",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere dello Sport offer a different perspective, claiming that Sancho is taking 'a few more days' to decide his future. The report adds that Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini spoke to the 25-year-old, outlining how he could become a key part of the squad and replicate the form he showed during his peak years at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "It’s also noted that an agreement between United and Roma has been reached for an initial loan, with an option to buy set at €25m (£22m).",
      "MEN Sport says: Hopefully, this situation will be resolved in the coming days. With the transfer window closing in just two weeks, the clock is ticking for United to finalise any sales before the deadline. For Sancho, a fresh start could offer the chance to reignite his career, but that may require him to take a wage cut. Considering the opportunity to play regularly and rebuild his reputation, such a decision, should be an obvious one.",

      "Casemiro believes Manchester United are \"on the right path\" despite losing against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hopeful of getting the new Premier League campaign off to a flying start against Arsenal, but United suffered a 1-0 defeat after an early goal from Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Altay Bayindir was at fault, failing to clear a corner, and United couldn't find an equaliser. However, there were positives to take from the performance and Arsenal were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Casemiro was disappointed to lose the opening game of the season and reiterated United must focus on winning, but he admitted the team are heading in the right direction again.",
      "\"Manchester United always has to think about the victory,\" Casemiro said after the game.",
      "\"I’m not going to say that losing is okay, we have to win. Manchester United always has to win. I think we have shown good moments, and we have played much better today.",
      "\"But we have to look for the victory. We are on the right path now. We have a good connection and that’s the path we are taking.\"",
      "Casemiro was asked about what has been missing at United and responded: \"It’s complicated. Everyone can have an opinion. In the last few years, we have reached several finals, such as the Europa League [last season] and the thing missing is to win.",
      "\"Few clubs win these cups and we need to continue thinking about winning these trophies and to continue improving.\"",
      "The midfielder was also briefly quizzed on his future and explained: \"I am very happy here. My family is happy here. I enjoy every day at Carrington and at Old Trafford. If people talk from the outside, that’s fine, it doesn’t interest me. I just want to focus on winning.\"",
      "United have been receptive to offers for Casemiro for the last two summer windows, but no appropriate offers have been received for the 33-year-old, who has entered the final year of his contract at the club.",

      "A home defeat without scoring is familiar fare from Manchester United. Their productive performance was unfamiliar.",
      "United were the more enterprising and energetic team, fuelled by the optimistic atmosphere that was enhanced by pre-match adjustments. United fashioned more goalscoring chances in one afternoon against Arsenal than they did in one month last season.",
      "Yet the bottom line is they lost their opening fixture for the eighth time in the Premier League era. United have been beaten 16 times at home in the league since the start of the 2023-24 campaign. Ruben Amorim was not on his haunches as much but his hands were often planted on his crown.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt dropped to the turf at full-time. United players and staff still embarked on a lap of honour. Purists would rather see them head straight down the tunnel for a raw debrief.",
      "Hope is at least back again at United, in spite of another home reverse. The six added minutes elicited an excitable cheer. There was no air of resignation as there was throughout the defeatist performances of last season.",
      "But no striker and no goals. Benjamin Sesko crossed the white line to the sound of an expectant roar in the 65th minute. His inactive cameo partly legislated for why Amorim did not start him.",
      "Few teams are better equipped to defend a lead than Arsenal, a throwback to George Graham's artisans. United were undone by another Arsenal set piece.",
      "This was an archetypal 1-0-to-the-Ar-se-nal. They were second best for the majority of the afternoon and their supporters were constantly irked by the referee, Simon Hooper. They still shielded their goal for 77 minutes whilst leading.",
      "United, having invested almost £74million in a new number nine, played without one. Amorim has refused to accommodate Rasmus Hojlund after he aired his intention to stay and the strikerless experiments against Everton in Atlanta and Fiorentina in Manchester signposted a similar set-up against Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund is so unwanted he was omitted from the matchday squad with Joshua Zirkzee available again. Hojlund, loitering in the tunnel pre-match, watched the first half from the directors' box but was not visible in the second half.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made up the front three in United's final friendly against Fiorentina. The only goal United managed was an own goal. They lined up together again and this time there was no goal.",
      "Amorim's team was littered with contentious calls and the 'keeper was the costliest. Altay Bayindir was fortunate to play for United again after he conceded a winner direct from a corner at Tottenham in December and it practically happened again against the other north London club.",
      "Bayindir is not better than Tom Heaton, in his 40th year, never mind Andre Onana. United's first choice will reclaim his role at Fulham this week.",
      "Onana himself was cornered by Arsenal in their victory at the Emirates last season. The sight of Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes, stood forlornly in the technical area was as familiar as United trailing at half-time without scoring.",
      "It was in the 27th minute that the absence of Amad and a striker was visible. Mbeumo delayed his pass too long for the overlapping and offside Diogo Dalot, who crossed to an invisible centre forward, much to the supporters' chagrin. The broadcasters zoomed in on a watchful Sesko. Amad was the first game-changer sent on by Amorim.",
      "Sesko remained in the dugout when the first batch of substitutes headed out to warm up a minute into the second half. Zirkzee was among those to limber up. Amad was soon summoned and his sprints along the touchline were more urgent. Sesko joined them five minutes later.",
      "Amad and Bruno Fernandes were the only two players who started in all five of United's pre-season friendlies. To bench Amad was pragmatic, bordering on the negative. United were lifted by his zig-zag bursts into the Arsenal area.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Sesko could have easily joined their opponents. The Stretford End heckled Gyokeres with a rendition of \"You fat b*****d\". It would be diplomatic to describe him as heavy. So heavy that Casemiro caught up with Gyokeres in the United third after losing the ball inside the Arsenal half. The hostility from the United fans continued up to Gyokeres' withdrawal on the hour.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo gave a glimpse of how productive United's new front three could be. They were responsible for the four on-target attempts from United in the first half. Patrick Dorgu pinged the post. Mbeumo had the measure of the rash Riccardo Calafiori, booked in the 42nd minute for a tactical foul. Calafiori was still the only one to get on the scoresheet.",
      "Mount continues to produce his finest work off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with Mount, misguidedly promoted to the Europa League final starting XI at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. Mount and Casemiro were both hooked simultaneously.",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "Hearty applause followed United's near-misses, such was their encouraging play. Eight minutes in, Declan Rice turned to the Arsenal back four and attempted to gee them up. William Saliba's foul on Dorgu was as much to rouse himself and his teammates.",
      "Mikel Arteta almost encroached onto the pitch to berate the wasteful Gabriel Martinelli after a breakaway broke down. One of the Arsenal analysts reacted by smacking the wall of the press box.",
      "Amorim urged United to commence attacks through Luke Shaw. Sometimes United bided their time, waiting for room to free up either side of De Ligt, the meat in the back-three sandwich.",
      "It was another middle centre back Amorim turned to up the other end. Harry Maguire practically played up front in a team that has negotiated a fee upwards of £180m on three strikers. All three were present at the stadium as United fired blanks.",
      "That was familiar.",

      "The only goal of the game came in the first-half courtesy of Riccardo Calafiori's header. United created a number of opportunities with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo both coming close.",
      "There were plenty of positives for Amorim to build on in the coming weeks. Patrick Dorgu and Matthijs de Ligt impressed while the early signs of a relationship blossoming between Cunha and Mbeumo are encouraging.",
      "Last season, one of the biggest problems within United's team was their attitude. So many times did players seem disinterested after defeats. Fortunately, it looks as though Amorim has worked on that.",
      "When the final whistle went and Arsenal players celebrated, there was a real feeling of disappointment within the players. Some United players, including Cunha, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro, all dropped to the floor.",
      "Following a season where they were constantly short of quality compared to their opponent, United matched, if not outperformed, Arsenal on Sunday and the reaction of the players.",

      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Ruben Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "The Red Devils showed a much-improved side of themselves in their Premier League opener against Arsenal, despite the 1-0 defeat. The Gunners struck early in the first half through Riccardo Calafiori, when a mistake from keeper Altay Bayındır allowed the defender in at the back post to score.",
      "While United had more shots - on and off target - and a higher percentage of passes and completions, they were unable to capitalise on this pressure for the rest of the game. However, fans will have been impressed with Amorim's side throughout the Premier League outing and the improvements since the end of the previous campaign.",
      "Ex-Newcastle star Shearer was full of praise for the Red Devils over the weekend, but warned the club about their problem area. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, the Premier League icon also hailed new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for bringing something new to Old Trafford.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Onana didn't make the matchday squad for the first game of the season, with 39-year-old veteran Heaton on the bench instead. Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is on United's transfer radar, after he was dropped from the team's travelling squad to face Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup last week.",
      "His contract in the French capital expires at the end of next season, leaving him free to depart without a transfer fee. With the current tension between player and club, it is likely that the shotstopper will depart Paris this summer for a smaller price, but United rivals Manchester City are currently leading the race for his signature.",
      "AC Milan's Mike Maignan is also a player of interest to the Red Devils, as they continue to discuss a potential swap deal for young striker Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish forward has fallen out of favour with Amorim and looks likely to leave Manchester this summer.",
      "It has also been reported that David De Gea could make a shock return to United following the discovery of a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to leave for a reduced fee.",

    "body": [
      "Former Manchester United coach Michael Carrick has shed light on why Scott McTominay didn't fulfil his potential at Old Trafford.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to Napoli last summer and clinched the Serie A title and the league's Most Valuable Player award in his first season. McTominay made a significant impact in Italy, scoring 13 goals and providing six assists in 36 games, quickly becoming a fan favourite in Naples. His recent success contrasts sharply with the scrutiny he faced at United, particularly when he was part of a midfield duo with Fred, often referred to as 'McFred'.",
      "Despite some memorable performances in his final full season at Old Trafford, notching 10 goals across competitions and scoring at pivotal moments for Erik ten Hag's team, McTominay's rise at Napoli caught many by surprise. Carrick, who served as an assistant coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, explained that McTominay's talent was always apparent at United, even though he was asked to play a more defensive role.",
      "\"He was always, yeah, we had a bit of a kind of few discussions with it about Scott when we were coaching with Ole and we played a lot with him and Fred and actually had a lot of good success in many ways with the two of them,\" Carrick said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. \"More defensively, yeah, he could, he was kind of the box-to-box, if you like, done a bit of everything, but more defensive.",
      "\"But he was reliable, he was a fantastic attitude, great to work with. But he always had, and in training, he always had an eye for goal. He was a great finisher. Getting in the box, and he had that, I never really had it, but with certain lads, getting around the box is just that extra bit of time to finish.",
      "\"Like a [Frank Lampard], you know? I know Lamps was obviously best of the best of that, but he's got a sense of that, getting in the box, and it drops to him, like it's goals, he's just finding that.",
      "\"And he always had it, and we tried a couple of times, and just because of the make-up with the team, it didn't quite work at that time, but there was always something in there where you think, he's got goals in him, Scotty.\"",
      "\"I'm so happy that he's gone to do well, because he deserves it,\" Carrick continued. \"I'm sad that it's not at United, because I think he's kind of the one that you want at the club, because he just drives everything, he's a heart and soul, but to see him go on and do well, it speaks volumes, and there's no one taking that. He's had ups and downs, big ups and downs, and he's gone on, and actually he's not looked back now. It's incredible what he's done.\"",
      "The Scotland international, who came up through United's academy and became a first-team regular under Solskjaer by 2019, won the FA Cup and League Cup and reached the 2021 Europa League final during his time at Old Trafford. He made 255 appearances in total for United, and Carrick outlined why McTominay wasn't deployed in a more attacking role until he moved to Napoli.",
      "\"Make-up of the team, the dynamics, whatever,\" Carrick explained. \"Look at England, you know, you've had it with England over the years. Why does it not work with England? Sometimes it's not an individual thing, it's a dynamic, it's the make-up of the group, it's the atmosphere surrounding it, that's what I'm saying.",
      "\"It's not always just about that football or that game, there's kind of feelings around it sometimes that affect everyone's judgement, you know, it's not always as straightforward as that.\"",
      "While Carrick argues that McTominay played a deeper midfield role to maintain the balance of the team, the player himself believes he was misunderstood after being promoted to United's first team. The 28-year-old was prepared to play wherever he was required and believed he could be more consistent than some of his team-mates, but this attitude may have stopped him from claiming his best position in the United side.",
      "\"When I got into the first team, I was quite misprofiled in where I was playing,\" McTominay recalled to The Athletic in April. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there.",
      "\"But I was being used as a number six or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game. But when you're playing for Manchester United and you're 20, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at number eight ahead of Paul Pogba. It's not realistic.\"",
      "\"You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do,\" he added. \"In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.",
      "\"They would always sign someone who wouldn't necessarily be what people expected them to be. My mentality was that I was always there, ready to go, ready to take my opportunity. I always wanted to prove my worth, to show I could play every game. It's not the sort of thing that affects me. You can only be in control of what you do.\"",

      "Altay Bayindir, whose performance was questioned by Gary Neville after his hand in Calafiori's goal, also started between the posts while rumours continue to swirl around Andre Onana's future.",
      "Amorim, 40, has shown a willingness to make brave calls in his squad selection since replacing Erik ten Hag in November 2024. And Sunday backed up Brown's previous assertion as to how the incumbent is similar to club great Ferguson in that sense.",
      "\"I remember first coming in and Sir Alex got rid of big names,\" he told The Athletic earlier this month in Chicago. \"They’d been brilliant for him over the years, but just like that – gone. That’s the best way to do it.",
      "\"He’s signed a few players who can play in different positions, especially those who have done really well in the Premier League. That’s a massive thing, something we’ve missed.\"",
      "Brown, who made his Premier League debut for United in 1998, first entered the club's first-team set-up at a time of transition for Ferguson. He had led the Red Devils to major honours with the likes of Gary Pallister, Brian McClair, Lee Sharpe and Steve Bruce in the mid-1990s, but wasn't afraid to move on big talents when the time felt right.",
      "Onana and Hojlund were signed under Ten Hag's reign in the summer of 2023 for a combined potential fee of around £115million. Both are being linked with transfers away from United this summer, though Amorim insisted on Sunday that Onana's absence was due to a lack of training and fitness.",
      "Bayindir's failure to dominate his area at an early Declan Rice corner unfortunately highlighted the goalkeeper situation at Old Trafford once more. Familiar struggles emerged in attack, though Mbeumo and Cunha did look promising, while fellow new signing Benjamin Sesko could only do so much in his 25-minute cameo off the bench.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were also omitted from United's first squad of the Premier League season. Each among the quartet has been tipped to leave the club this summer, providing more evidence of Amorim's conviction in his calls.",
      "That's in addition to academy graduate and former golden child Marcus Rashford already being loaned out to Barcelona this summer. And with January arrival Patrick Dorgu also impressing down United's left flank on Sunday, Amorim's imprint is steadily taking shape at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "The final fortnight of the summer transfer window could yield even more change, with certain sellable stars still technically on the books. However, Amorim's unwillingness to involve them despite the pressure of the Premier League returning shows a staunch commitment not too unlike Ferguson himself.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days. And Besiktas are keen but Sancho is said to be unwilling to consider Turkey until he absolutely has to, when their window remains open after the others shut. Roma, you would think, would be a very appealing option if the exiled winger is serious about kickstarting his career. But no. Despite Roma agreeing a fee with United, Sancho isn’t happy with the terms on offer. Which makes you wonder what or who the f*** he’s waiting for.",

      "",
      "19) Morten Hjulmand – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBrighton are refusing to sell Carlos Baleba, so Hjulmand is next on United’s list, apparently. The Dane has worked with Ruben Amorim and knows his system but links with United pre-date the manager’s appointment at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nNapoli have been in touch with United to ask about what they might want to let the Serie A champions borrow Hojlund with Romelu Lukaku crocked for around three months. Which might be tempting for the player but United will be holding out for a permanent move.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. There will be more talks and it could change very quickly, but as things stand, the Blues are standing firm over demanding a permanent transfer and the fee that would involve.",
      "",
      "15) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National. Given Liverpool face Newcastle next Monday night, it seems most likely that something will happen after that.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player has not taken it well.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\n“I think he is going to stay. I think. He told me that. But maybe tomorrow it changes.” Lewis seems very keen to stay but if City decide they want to cash in, there’s little the academy graduate can do. The right-back started at Wolves on Saturday, though, so he’s certainly not surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found.",
      "",
      "10) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Nkunku in as part of the deal. It is clear Chelsea need to shift some deadwood before they can sign more forwards.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nHojlund was left out of the United squad beaten by Arsenal which suggests something is afoot, most likely involving Milan. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” said their sporting director Igli Tare on Sunday. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.” United want around £30million; Milan would obviously prefer to pay less or take the Denmark striker on loan first.",
      "",
      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed. If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "6) 🔼 Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nCity say Ederson stayed in Manchester rather than travel to Wolves on Saturday because he had a dicky tummy. It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Douglas Luiz – Juventus to Nottingham Forest\nForest have seemingly only recently realised that the transfer window is open, with the former Aston Villa captain their top midfield target now their attack is sufficiently strengthened. The Brazilian has been pants in Italy but his performances for Villa are still fresh enough in the memory to believe that this could be a fine addition.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Noah Okafor – AC Milan to Leeds United\nLeeds are said to have offered Milan over £17million for the forward, with a four-year contract on the table. Okafor offers versatility and Leeds can offer game time to a player with only 11 Serie A starts in the last two seasons with Milan and Napoli. So you would think Okafor would be game if Milan are.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nArsenal’s faffing has given Spurs a window and the way Eze lingered in front of the travelling Palace fans on Sunday could be viewed as a possible farewell by those who really want to interpret it that way. The latest update suggests Tottenham and Palace are talking after Eze expressed a willingness to move. Spurs currently offering £55million plus £5million in add-ons. Eze’s release clause, worth £68million, expired last week.",
      "MORE ON EZE: Four real and compelling reasons why Eberechi Eze might choose Spurs over Arsenal",

      "1) 🔼 Ben Doak – Liverpool to Bournemouth\nDoak is undergoing a medical at Bournemouth after a deal was agreed that could see Liverpool bank £25million. A reminder: Doak has played 40 minutes in the Premier League across three substitute appearances. He was decent in the  Championship for Boro last season. But £25million?",

      "“But today, he was nowhere near it, because it wasn’t at the same level of music as the others are playing. The others were playing a kind of sloppy but slow-motion game while he was trying to get more vertical – one ball, one opportunity, one cross. It never happened.”",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",

Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",

      "Onana‘s long-term future at Man Utd is in doubt after his form fell off a cliff during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The experienced goalkeeper had a decent debut season after replacing David De Gea, but his performances dramatically declined as he was deservedly criticised for his poor form.",
      "This has fuelled speculation linking Man Utd with potential replacements, though they are yet to sign a new goalkeeper in this transfer window.",
      "Onana missed a portion of pre-season due to injury, so Alter Bayindir started in goal for Man Utd’s opening game of the 2025/26 Premier League season on Sunday as the Red Devils were beaten 1-0.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland shine, Potter sack, Man City and Chiesa click, Brentford ‘naive’",
      "It was initially assumed that Onana’s absence was due to his injury status, though head coach Ruben Amorim insisted before the match that he has “recovered”.",
      "“It’s an option. We try to choose the best players for each game. Next week is a different life and in this week we chose this way,” Amorim said on omitting Onana and Rasmus Hojlund for the Arsenal match.",
      "When pressed further on Onana’s absence, he added: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claims Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad becuase hs is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "Romano has also commented on two potential replacements for Onana, with a deal for one “completely quiet”.",
      "“The last bid they made was for Emi Martinez was a loan proposal in July. For the moment, that situation has gone completely quiet,” Romano added.",
      "“The goalkeeper they still like and are keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp. They’ve been monitoring him for a long time.",
      "“If Man Utd decide to invest in a goalkeeper between now and the end of the window, Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",

      "33-year-old Casemiro starting against Arsenal at the weekend highlighted United’s need for midfield reinforcements and Ferdinand believes that strengthening that area should come in the form of Wharton.",
      "“We’ve been talking about Baleba, he’s been the hot topic for the last month or so, but before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys I was saying,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“He’s the nearest to a Michael Carrick type, who’s a controller, who can play, who plays forward from that deeper line position at times. He can be an eight if you need him to be and can run on at times if need be, but he’s more of a conductor and can control things.",
      "“I watched him in a couple of games last season against big teams like Man City and Liverpool, and he looks unfazed. He looks ready for a big occasion.",
      "“He enjoys pressure, can play under pressure, and the game kind of slows down when the ball is around him. I love him. I think he’s a fantastic footballer.”",
      "If United were to follow Ferdinand’s advice, they could have a battle on their hands to sign the England international with Real Madrid reportedly keen to bring him to Spain. If United were to fail in their pursuit of Wharton, Ferdinand pointed towards another young talent already at the club.",
      "“But what I would say at Manchester United, we have Kobbie Mainoo,” Ferdinand continued.",

      "Let’s see how they go away at Fulham next week and put together an actual run of games before we start hailing them. All I saw yesterday was a lot of huff and puff against a team that seemed almost intent on giving them the ball and allowing them to come at them.

      "Concerns continue to remain unabated over Amorim’s unfathomable team selection. Why was Dalot fielded over Amad? We all saw what Amad did in the short period he played. A related issue or concern is why did Amorim field a team with no natural striker, even though the striker or rather lack of an effective striker has plagued United for some time. There is no excuse for this strategic shortcoming, exacerbated by the fact that we were playing against Arsenal. Did Arsenal bench Gyokeres? No he started. Did Liverpool bench Ekitike? Of course not.",
      "The point must further be made that United’s poor finishing persisted in the match. Numerous chances were created and washed. This now endemic issue must be fixed soonest if United is to improve its position on the EPL table.",

      "",
      "In defence of Gyokeres\nSurely the worst game he could have had as his first match was against his former manager who knows him inside out and exactly how to counter him.

I won’t speak for every Gooner, but having watched Saliba, Gabriel & Raya for a few years now, I never felt worried that Utd would score. I was only concerned that Cunha would eventually flop his way into a cheap penalty.",

Sure, they didn’t look as clueless as the majority of last season, but other than Cunha’s shot that was well saved, they didn’t really trouble Arsenal. Sure they had a lot of possession and the stats will tell you they had a lot of shots on goal, but the vast majority were very easily dealt with.",

So Isak would cost some 200m over 5 years and Gyokeres 110m. I also find it hilarious to say hes “available” when hes currently on strike not playing for any teams since hes so “available”.

Their attack was direct and varied, the players are playing with a sense of freedom, the defense remains solid. This United team are a completely different animal and I am extremely happy with 1-0 at a buoyant old Trafford.

That player is seldom within playing distance of the ball, and they are even less seldomly called for a foul. I recognize that other teams attempt to crowd the ‘keeper from corners as well, but Arsenal have clearly taken it to new levels with their set piece coach and mob rush to the front/back post in recent seasons. Stats back this up as well; they showed a lovely graphic during yesterday’s match where Arsenal have outscored all other Premier League sides from corners by something like 10 goals since 23/24.

He drove a motorbike, and used to bring you out for thrilling drives, he was cool and had a leather jacket. But he was also a little unreliable. Not always there when you want him, or at least not there in the way you need him. So Ange and Mom parted ways.",

They even had plans for set pieces! You could see Frank’s fingerprints all over it. They looked like a team build on solid foundations (despite only a few weeks of work!). To follow that up against Burnley, with a no nonsense, very professional, clean cut 3-0 win was just perfect. Many might rightly say “It’s just Burnley” but the reality is, Spurs were one of the most generous teams in the league last year to give points to promoted sides, with our sloppy, inconsistent league form.",

      "5. A midfield 3 of Yarmoliuk, Jensen and Milambo is never going to be good enough in the PL, but especially against a team as good as Forest. We didn’t have much choice on the day, but it shouldn’t be a surprise that we struggled to keep the ball against Forest’s high energy press, especially in the first half.",
      "6. It does make me worry how much we’ll miss Norgaard. We all knew how important he was to us, but it seems like we’re not really replacing him (Hendo is not the natural ball-winner that Norgaard is). Maybe Janelt when he returns from injury could play that role but either way it’s a step down",
      "7. Going forward we lacked any kind of potency until Schade came on. But hopefully Ouatarra will make a difference and maybe Wissa when he’s finished his strop can return to give us some more options up top.",
      "8. I was surprised how all over the place we were defensively as this was the one area I thought we would be pretty solid. Maybe just an early season thing and it was largely individual errors which led to the goals (Collins the biggest culprit)",
      "9. The fact we improved considerably second half is a positive, and at least points to Keith Andrews making a difference in the dressing room.",
      "10. Although not a great start, I don’t feel too pessimistic about the season. We should hopefully be much stronger already next week against Villa, and losing away to Forest is no disaster.",
      "11. I kind of assumed (and hoped!) that Chris Wood just had one of those mad seasons last year when everything clicked and he’d revert to the mean this time around. 2 goals in the first 45 minutes of the season, both high quality finishes (genuine “striker” goals) suggest otherwise!",

      "Sunderland and Manchester City could not have planned better starts, while a Liverpool hero stepped up. And West Ham should “panic about its managers”.",
      "",
      "Sunderland\nIt is a phrase Regis Le Bris applied liberally to this Sunderland team in pre-season, the need to “build connections”.",
      "With eight debutants and a manager new to the Premier League, but also a fanbase still learning that excitement and expectation is to be encouraged rather than immediately extinguished, it was a requirement if they were to hold their own in the top flight.",
      "This is a different club to that which last graced and disgraced the top flight but the memories will have lingered. While no member of this squad can be tarred with the same brush of failure that swept Sunderland into the Championship eight years ago, many associated with the club will have recalled the misery of their last Premier League season.",
      "They were erased in 90 minutes which suggested Sunderland can break the curse of the promoted team.",
      "Across the last two seasons, Ipswich, Leicester, Southampton, Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton took anywhere between six and 11 games to record their first victory en route to heading back down from whence they came. In total, they won just 17 of 192 matches against non-promoted sides. West Ham at home was a gimme of an opening fixture but Sunderland did look far better prepared in comparison against precisely the sort of team they should be aiming to pull in and overtake.",
      "And the points about tactical adaptability and versatility are especially apt when promoted sides have been used as a vehicle for career progression in recent years. “We won’t play like Guardiola or De Zerbi, because we are Sunderland, and I am Regis Le Bris,” the Frenchman said last season. Both seem well-equipped for the challenges ahead together.",
      "",
      "Manchester City\nIt could be argued that Manchester City did not have a single unqualified success of a transfer window for at least a couple of years. They were underpinned by brilliant coaching and players for long enough to suffer a few market mistakes in succession, but it was always likely to catch them eventually.",
      "A mid-season scare triggered an extravagant January spend which spilled over into the summer. It turns out investing more than £100m on defenders and almost as much in both midfield and attack in a single calendar year, with £27m and a Marcus Bettinelli reserved between the sticks, can cure any and all ailments.",
      "That will prompt chequebook manager accusations and talk of 115 charges but Pep Guardiola will not care. He is a phenomenal coach of brilliant players and Manchester City appear to have recruited at least a handful more in 2025 to sort out a whole load of problems.",

      "",
      "Federico ‘Divock’ Chiesa\nWhile Arne Slot spoke of “the fine-tuning we still need to find defensively”, the immediacy with which a repurposed Liverpool attack clicked and coruscated against Bournemouth was encouraging but unsurprising.",
      "It is possible to rely on instinct and pure technique to find solutions to problems at one end; the other requires time, patience and repetition to hone and perfect.",
      "Four debutants is as many as a reigning champion has ever named in their starting line-up of a Premier League opening weekend game. The accepted wisdom is never to change a winning team but Liverpool did so out of necessity and used that opportunity to build from a position of power.",
      "This is basically a new side, albeit with many familiar composite parts. Trent Alexander-Arnold was uniquely critical to how Liverpool defended and attacked on and off the ball. An element of unpredictability and instability when moving away from that is inevitable even when the most important gear in their midfield machine becomes available and players build fitness and rhythm.",
      "Yet it was the only first-team addition of last season’s £10m spend who stepped up to spare some rather more uncomfortable questions being asked of this summer’s £300m binge.",
      "Only in two of his previous Premier League appearances has Chiesa been given more than the eight minutes afforded to him to make a difference against Bournemouth. Injuries have hampered the Italian but it did always seem a largely pointless, opportunistic signing for such a strong frontline.",
      "This summer has, however, opened up an unlikely space for a wildcard forward beloved by the fanbase and popular within the squad, the sort crucial to any successful team. When the main cast members falter and fade, the ensemble needs to be trusted and Chiesa has that now.",
      "Even Darwin Nunez, who never convinced and was deemed dispensable at the right price, could list a number of game-changing moments he produced when called upon. No-one will ever play the role better than Divock Origi but that final roll of the dice, fifth and final substitution suggested Chiesa can give a passable impression, which is all Liverpool need from him as a £10m forward surrounded by those signed for far more.",
      "Those dissenting voices doubting Liverpool’s title defence can and should still be heard. Many aspects of the overall plan made little sense on the pitch and Slot will know that flexibility in his ideas is necessary. A title-winning campaign should not look the same at the end as it did at the beginning because lessons are learned and acted upon; last season started with Jarell Quansah at centre-half so the coach has earned a certain level of faith in his ability.",
      "The hope will be that when the time comes to review this season, Chiesa’s bench-based brilliance has become frequent enough to be no surprise. But after a year of struggles and setbacks, he earned that one spell in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nThe most possession Nottingham Forest had in any Premier League game last season was 55% against Brentford at home; they lost 2-0 and Nuno spoke post-match about finding “better solutions”.",
      "With the same amount of the ball against the same opponent at the same venue – and with nine of the same players starting – three months later, Forest converted their territorial advantage into what was at times total dominance.",
      "That is testament to a tactical adaptability many felt was beyond Nuno, who had only previously coached 11 of his 71 Premier League wins with at least as much of the ball.",
      "The difficult second album has at least started with a compelling track.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo\nBournemouth were a compelling mirror image of Liverpool as a side finding its feet defensively while retaining an innate ability to hurt any opponent going forward.",
      "It has been a difficult summer and a slight deviation from their stated stepping-stone plan of never sanctioning more than two first-team sales in the same season. A new keeper, centre-half and left-back might have been grateful for an easier first assignment.",
      "But in basically bringing those pre-season shooting videos to life, Semenyo proved that his new contract might have been the best possible business Bournemouth could have conducted this summer.",
      "How depressing that it was destined to be framed as a response to one prick rather than being a showcase of an excellence it is easy to imagine the 25-year-old replicating on grander stages.",
      "Yet in retaining control over that situation and basically fool-proofing their attack for at least another season, Bournemouth have guaranteed their eventual reward for helping produce such a phenomenal talent and character. That is what they do and they are damn good at it.",
      "",
      "Newcastle without Alexander Isak\nAfter a summer spent self-injuriously and painstakingly proving they are not a particularly big club – or at least not at all well-versed in navigating the sharp end of the sport – how relieved Newcastle must have been to remind the Premier League they remain a big team.",
      "It has been a chastening transfer window but even that is starting to turn around in terms of signings and the petering out of a saga which, for better or worse, need no longer dominate the discourse and cloud the outlook. There can be few better distractions than the return of actual football.",
      "Alexander Isak not being front and centre of every discussion can only benefit Newcastle, even if his absence remained a talking point purely because of what they were missing. But that was more as a concept rather than an individual.",
      "The Magpies did almost everything right up until the final action and a competent, reliable centre-forward can solve that. The position is made for Isak if he is willing to run off all the humble pie headed his way if the deadline passes without a move.",
      "But selling him and reinvesting those funds in a natural goalscorer while improving depth and quality across the rest of an already very good squad really isn’t the worst scenario either.",
      "Newcastle were really good without Isak, can be much better with him, but could be even better than that if they sold up and got the next few recruitment calls right. Against all odds and contrary to popular opinion all summer, it is a decent position to be in.",
      "",
      "Spurs\nAnother club who will welcome the opportunity to take their collective mind off transfer nonsense by getting down to the far less important business of kicking a bag of air around. Doing so at home to a Scott Parker team was a blessing.",
      "The Super Cup performance indicated Spurs can hold their own against better sides; this showed they can sweep lesser opponents away through moments of sheer individual brilliance outside a solid structure already installed by Thomas Frank. They have already matched last season’s points haul at home to promoted teams.",
      "The luxury of having forwards signed for £60m, £55m and £47.5m rather than being made to sell them will be among the bigger differences Frank finds in his new role. It certainly helped decide his first game and settle the nerves.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThere is a lot to be said for winning against the balance of play. Even more so away, considering the only other side to do so on the opening weekend was a Manchester City team given the slightly easier task of trekking down to Wolves.",
      "It is the sort of result Arsenal would not have been able to grind out before and that should be reflected in the analysis. The softer, more pliable Gunners of years gone by would have drawn or even lost, wilting under the pressure.",
      "The room for improvement was clear, but so too was evidence of how far they have come.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nIn their last 10 games, Palace have visited Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal and hosted Nottingham Forest, while visiting Wembley three times to face the two most recent Premier League champions and a Champions League quarter-finalist.",
      "They have remained unbeaten throughout, winning the first two major trophies in the club’s existence.",
      "Their continued wranglings with obscure rules and regulations must be a little annoying but having the best pound-for-pound coaching in the league is a fine consolation.",

      "Perhaps they should.",
      "It also feels disconcertingly premature for said manager to be discussing the need to “bounce back” while repeatedly lamenting the lack of “the basics”. The argument behind keeping Potter despite the struggles endured last campaign revolved around him needing a pre-season to properly get his ideas across, yet no team looked nearly as unready or rudimentary over the opening weekend.",
      "West Ham were in control until the precise moment they weren’t, when a team mostly unversed in the ways of the Premier League bullied and subdued them.",
      "Potter was right when he said: “If we don’t do the basics right, you can bring in player and player and player and player and it’s not going to solve the problems.” But the same can be said of the individual paid handsomely to ensure those basics are actually in place in time for the new season.",

      "A bolshy Nottingham Forest side away would have been a difficult assignment for any team, never mind one in such a state of flux.",
      "There are the makings of a decent team with those composite parts Brentford have assembled in trying to remake the 2022 version of Liverpool – and Mikkel Damsgaard’s return should boost them – but Dango Ouattara will need to start the theme of any and all new signings hitting the ground running.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim\nIt was a vast improvement. But that Opta stat about it being the fastest a manager has reached 15 defeats in the Premier League without taking charge of a newly-promoted team in that period since Paul Hart is very funny.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nHow curious that one of only three teams who didn’t name an outfield summer signing in their starting line-up would put in arguably the most disjointed, confused performance.",
      "There is a sense that not only does Villa’s season hang in the balance of the final couple of weeks of this transfer window, but that it is more true for them than any other side.",
      "That was reinforced by Unai Emery’s impassioned thoughts on financial restrictions before the game, the vocal fan sentiment during it, and the level of frustration at stagnation after, fuelled by having three shots to 16 at home to a fellow prospective glass-ceiling shatterer who have also had a difficult summer.",
      "Even the impact of their only debutant showed the benefits of keeping the pack fresh, the options plentiful and the competition healthy. But 34-year-old Marco Bizot, purchased for a small undisclosed fee and immediately showing up Robin Olsen, cannot remain their best signing this season if they wish to maintain this upward trajectory.",
      "",
      "Chelsea\nIt will be interesting to see what comes of Enzo Maresca rocking the Chelsea boat ever so slightly instead of toeing the company line. The Italian was appointed in part because of his malleability to the club’s stated transfer policy, so going against that to request more signings was a change in tack.",
      "But it did feel like Maresca was rewarding Josh Acheampong rather than using him as a message to the board like Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte would. Jeremie Boga started the opening day of the 2017/18 season, was substituted on 18 minutes after a red card and then got loaned out to the Championship; history will not repeat itself here.",
      "A fine performance from the 19-year-old is unlikely to sate Maresca’s transfer desires. When Chelsea get up to speed after their Club World Cup excursions it seems likely Levi Colwill’s absence will only be more obvious.",
      "",
      "Djordje Petrovic\nThe conceder of nine goals in three appearances against Liverpool, all scored by different players which have the makings of a really solid if slightly attacking starting line-up: Bradley, Van Dijk, Szoboszlai, Diaz, Jota, Gakpo, Chiesa, Salah, Ekitike.",
      "They need a back-up keeper before and specifically for January 24 is what we’re saying here.",

      "Arsenal won at Manchester United and there were ’emotional reactions’ all over the shop, not most from Declan Rice.",
      "",
      "Chain reaction\nThere’s little doubt that Manchester United were improved against a stuttering Arsenal on Sunday afternoon (you can read 16 Conclusions that say as much in a lot more words here) and there was no shortage of narrative, with the Manchester United goalkeeping situation and the non-performance of Viktor Gyokeres chief among them.",
      "But do you know what their absolutely wasn’t? Any real controversy. There was no Mikel Arteta outburst, no Ruben Amorim meltdown, no red card offence, nothing more than a half-hearted penalty appeal.",
      "That won’t do, will it?",
      "Emotional Arsenal reaction said it all vs Manchester United",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "That’s definitely worth a headline – that two men employed by a football club might get rather agitated when their team makes a mistake. The fact that the headline is illustrated with an image of Mikel Arteta on the touchline is presumably just an admin error.",
      "‘Reaction’ is clearly high on those Excel documents circulated by SEO experts, because the MEN also bring us this:",
      "88th minute reaction confirms Manchester United’s biggest problems vs Arsenal",
      "And what was that ’88th minute reaction’ that confirmed United’s biggest problems, which are presumably that they cannot score goals?",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro’s purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "But if we want to talk reactions, we have to talk about Declan Rice apparently shouting at his teammates. Now, we missed this in real time so thank you to football.london for bringing this to our attention:",
      "Why Declan Rice shouted at Arsenal teammates as Viktor Gyokeres breaks first Premier League rule",
      "Why indeed. We can find no footage of this shouting and no reference on social media. It’s a ghost shout everywhere but this particular publication.",
      "We scan and scan and scan until finally…",
      "Rice, acting as the cool presence, spoke to his defenders and instructed them to switch on.",
      "So he ‘shouted’ while ‘acting as the cool presence’? FFS. Can we all not just accept sometimes that there was a football match and it was mildly interesting?",
      "",
      "Statement signing?\nOne trend of modern online journalism – not just football, but across the whole industry – is the re-framing of the social media post as a ‘message’, usually ‘cryptic’.",
      "But now a ‘message’ is not enough; any person posting on X or Instagram is ‘issuing a statement’, which used to be reserved for actually issuing a statement. We miss those days.",
      "So no, Mirror, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba did not ‘issue fresh statement amid Man Utd transfer confusion’, he merely posted on Instagram that he quite likes playing football, thank you. Oh and that he has a new haircut. Presumably amid some scissors.",
      "",
      "Manchester United reaction says it all as Alejandro Garnacho statement is made",
      "The ‘reaction’ that really ‘said it all’ was that the Manchester United players were ‘disappointed’ to lose 1-0. That really does ‘say it all’.",
      "But was there an ‘Alejandro Garnacho statement’ made on social media? Was there balls. But there was an image of Garnacho that had been defaced with an X.",
      "So in short, Manchester United’s players were disappointed to lose a game, while one fan brought a pen to the game. More as we get it.",
      "Tottenham are edging towards a deal for Eberechi Eze and Manchester United are fielding new enquiries for Rasmus Hojlund, all the while Yoane Wissa fumes…",
      "Arsenal fans are out in force to defence their club and their new ‘Viking clogger’, but there are also views on Bournemouth, Brentford, Spurs and more.",
      "Sunderland and Manchester City could not have planned better starts, while a Liverpool hero stepped up. And West Ham should “panic about its managers”.",
      "Ruben Amorim is already in a battle to keep his job at Manchester United; they cannot finish outside the top six.",
      "As bad as Viktor Gyokeres was against Manchester United on Sunday (and he was bad), he does not make the first Worst XI of the season.",
      "Arsenal beat Manchester United but it’s the Gunners who get an absolute kicking from the fans while Man Utd are optimistic."

      "According to reports, Rasmus Hojlund is ‘close’ to leaving Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed a significant update on Jadon Sancho.",
      "Man Utd appear to have turned their attention to sanctioning exits after making Benjamin Sesko their fourth summer signing.",
      "The arrival of Sesko looks to have sealed Hojlund’s fate as head coach Ruben Amorim looks to offload the striker after he was desperately poor for the Red Devils last season.",
      "Hojlund is not part of Amorim’s plans at Man Utd as the head coach ‘sent a clear message’ to the forward by leaving him out of his squad for Sunday’s 1-0 loss against Arsenal.",
      "Romano revealed on X: “Rasmus Højlund and Manchester United, it’s definitely over.",
      "“Højlund won’t be part of Man United squad against Arsenal as club sends clear message pushing for his exit.",

      "READ: 16 Conclusions on Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal: Gyokeres, Mbeumo, Martinelli, £100m Fernandes",
      "Hojlund is likely to be the next Man Utd player to leave as Football Insider are reporting that he is ‘closing in on an exit’ as a ‘new offer is to be accepted’.",
      "Former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown, who remains ‘very well-connected within the game’, has explained why he thinks Amorim has given up on Hojlund.",
      "“Man United have been looking to sell Hojlund all summer,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“From what I hear, they’ve decided they want to move him on, but they’re now aware they’re not going to get the sort of money they were originally looking for. So instead, they’ve decided they want to get him off the wage bill.",
      "“There have been talks over a move to Italy on loan with a view to making the deal permanent. “They don’t want to leave it open-ended because then he comes back next year and they’ve got the same problem, they want it wrapped up after the loan.”",
      "He continued: “But for now, clubs are willing to pay most of his wages to take him on loan and then the likelihood is they will sign him at the end of the deal.",
      "“From United’s point of view and the player’s, it’s time to draw a line under it. It hasn’t worked out, he hasn’t been good enough.",
      "“He’s an honest lad, and I’ve no doubt he could get better, but he hasn’t shown that at United. They’ve got other options in his position, so I expect this deal will be done if and when a new offer comes in for him.”",
      "Jadon Sancho had also looked close to an exit amid interest from Serie A giants AS Roma, though Romano revealed on Monday that he has turned down the Italian side.",
      "He said on X: “Jadon Sancho, currently not accepting AS Roma proposal and not even in talks with Besiktas now.",
      "“No agreement between Sancho and Roma on personal terms, despite Man United ready to accept £20m bid.",
      "“Besiktas deal in stand-by as Sancho won’t consider Turkey before September.”",
      "He added: “More on Jadon Sancho. Besiktas called two weeks ago to ask for deal conditions… but since then, no fresh contacts took place.",
      "“Besiktas remain willing to match Man United asking price but Sancho is not accepting a move to Turkey now.",
      "“It can be an option only later on — with Turkish market closing on September 12.”",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘sent a clear message’ to one current player ahead of Sunday’s match against Arsenal.",
      "Premier League side Fulham are interested in signing Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund this summer as they look for a goalscorer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ with Roma to sell Jadon Sancho as the Serie A side ‘work to agree personal terms’, according to reports.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Manchester United have received a £20million offer from Roma for out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s time at United could soon be over as Serie A’s Roma have reportedly lodged a bid for the 25-year-old.",

      "I think most of us think Manchester United will be better this year, as much as we might wish they wouldn’t be. They were certainly much better against a tedious, unimaginative and lucky Arsenal side.",
      "Being utterly rotten for two consecutive seasons when you’ve spent millions seems unlikely and goes against the orthodoxy that it’s not how you perform that dictates your Premier League position; it’s how much you spend on transfers and wages. And all those football brains couldn’t be wrong, could they?",
      "But if this is true, it is a time of danger to the United behemoth because there is much entertainment in watching them fail. It’s funny for the rest of us, representing – as it does – the collapse of the elites more broadly. In this world where failing upwards to positions of power and responsibility is sickeningly common, seeing expensive, over-vaunted players being useless is very satisfying and makes the world seem more sane.",
      "So in this way, radical failure is good for business. People want to watch them to see them be useless and fans want to see them to prove they’re not fickle.",
      "Fine for a season, but what happens if they’re a bit better? Say they finish ninth; that’s a disaster. Everyone has a blip, but what if it’s not a blip? Mediocrity can become endemic and there’s nothing like mediocrity to erode interest.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions on Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal: Gyokeres, Mbeumo, Martinelli, £100m Fernandes",
      "In other words, if they want to maintain their global position as one of the world’s biggest clubs, they need to get good and quickly. Winning a few, losing a few, simply won’t do. They have to aim at the top six to retain the level of interest they’re used to; being average is an interest-killer.",
      "Because this is a fanbase increasingly drawn from an encouraged tourist trade and they can’t be relied upon to keep buying all the expensive tat and snapping up over-priced tickets to watch mediocrity. TV people also want to build up their games as A Big Event and trying to do that when they keep getting turned over won’t do. They’re used to selling them with inappropriate hyperbole. But you can’t sell sh*t as sugar forever.",
      "Obviously coming back from 15th wouldn’t be easy for any side and United’s case is harder than most because of the pressure of the money that has been thrown at the problem, but that’s what Ruben Amorim must do to keep his job. No time to build, no time for bedding in; you’ve had those days. Be successful now. That’s the be all and end all.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair – in many ways he’s like the current government taking the blame for but having to deal with 14 years of the worst, most irresponsible, lunatic and hapless government. It’s not his fault, but nonetheless he’s got to do something about it. Does he look like he can?",
      "Liverpool are taking advantage of Bournemouth again, while Jadon Sancho has turned his nose up at a very good opportunity to be a footballer again.",
      "Arsenal fans are out in force to defence their club and their new ‘Viking clogger’, but there are also views on Bournemouth, Brentford, Spurs and more.",
      "Sunderland and Manchester City could not have planned better starts, while a Liverpool hero stepped up. And West Ham should “panic about its managers”.",
      "Arsenal won at Manchester United and there were ’emotional reactions’ all over the shop, not most from Declan Rice.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had his first rant of the season after a reporter suggested Tom Heaton would have been a better choice between the sticks.",
      "As bad as Viktor Gyokeres was against Manchester United on Sunday (and he was bad), he does not make the first Worst XI of the season."

      "Despite Amorim’s defence of Bayindir, the resounding consensus has been that United need a new goalkeeper even when Andre Onana returns to full fitness.",

      "“We’ve seen Martinez play in World Cup finals. They’ve played under extreme pressure and they can handle it. Man United need that.",

      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Man City have made an offer of £250m for Chelsea superstar Cole Palmer as they look to bring him back to the Etihad Stadium, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been rejected by Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, while Arsenal have decided to ‘distance’ themselves from a deal, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak is ‘training alone’ amid uncertainty over his Newcastle, who have been dealt another huge blow as a second star ‘wants to join’ Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea have turned down a huge bid from Premier League rivals Man City as they look to re-sign Cole Palmer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly bracing themselves for an ‘improved offer’ from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz with Anthony Gordon on their list of replacements."

      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” he has at his disposal at Manchester United and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Bayindir was a surprise selection ahead of Andre Onana at Old Trafford and flapped at Declan Rice’s inswinging corner to gift Riccardo Calafiori the easiest chance to score with a header at the back post for the Gunners.",
      "Roy Keane urged the Turkey international to use “violence” to get to the ball ahead of the attacking players and Amorim admits his players – including Bayindir – need to match the aggression of their opponents from set pieces.",
      "“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same,” Amorim said when asked if he was disappointed with the goal. “When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.",
      "“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No, (I’m not saying he should have acted differently) I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball, he chose to get the ball but he didn’t push so he cannot defend it.",
      "“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "When it was suggested Bayindir was at fault, Amorim responded: “He suffered a goal like this (before) when?",
      "And when a reporter reminded him of Tottenham last season, Amorim replied: “But without VAR. With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game against Arsenal? Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game?",
      "“You don’t remember the game, I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one in or the other (goalkeeper). I choose Altay.”",
      "Amorim was then asked about his decision not to include Onana in the squad after the Cameroon international was his No.1 last season.",
      "Amorim said: “I didn’t drop Onana from the squad. It is not the case of dropping Onana. Not putting in Andre Onana after just one week without seeing a game, without time training.",
      "“Tom and Altay, during the pre-season they did a very good job.”",
      "United have been heavily linked with a number of goalkeepers this summer, with Gianluigi Donnarumma’s decision to leave Paris Saint-Germain leading to suggestions he should be targeted.",
      "Pushed on whether he is happy with his current goalkeeping options and if the club need to sign another, Amorim continued: “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League. Especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team.",
      "“I’m happy with the players. I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is already in a battle to keep his job at Manchester United; they cannot finish outside the top six.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo humbled Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres in the war of the debutants but Manchester United may be reconsidering that £100m Bruno Fernandes call.",
      "",
      "1) A unique set of circumstances is required to produce a meeting between clubs the size of Arsenal and Manchester United from which the loser emerges generally happier than the winner.",
      "The emotions usually run too high, the resentment too bitter, the rivalry too deep and the bragging rights too enticing for analysis and introspection to override outcome bias.",
      "But a collapsed giant in 15th spending a similar amount to the perennial runners-up to bridge a 32-point gulf in quality, even just in a one-off game, only feeds the narrative of one side finding its feet at the start of a grand rebuild while the other stagnates and struggles to make the final step.",
      "",
      "2) The challenge as ever for Manchester United is to use this platform and these foundations properly.",
      "This was not the calibre of game Amorim’s side failed to show up in last season. He engineered a victory over Manchester City, draws with Liverpool, Arsenal and City and single-goal defeats to Spurs and Chelsea in his few chastening months since being appointed.",
      "It reached the point where a spirited draw at Anfield left the manager “really mad” because “we have to do it against any opponent,” while captain Bruno Fernandes said he “wasn’t worried about people putting in effort today because it’s Liverpool, everyone’s going to try to do their best. I’m more worried about Southampton”.",
      "Amad rescued them with a hat-trick in the final ten minutes of that game but Amorim was breaking televisions against Brighton a few days later and the club’s only Premier League victories from February up to the final day were at home to Ipswich and away at Leicester.",
      "Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal will and should invoke the cliche about the three points being the most important thing for the next few days.",
      "There is still some sense of achievement in gutting out a win at an invigorated but dilapidated Old Trafford, and avoiding the loss of any title race ground this early is necessary if the initial aim is to avoid complete and total head loss.",
      "Liverpool and Manchester City can make their four-goal statements before Arsenal stumble over their words, but the final message was all the same. And Chelsea showed that the title tag can weigh heavy for those unprepared.",
      "The run also goes on: Arsenal remain unbeaten in 22 Premier League games against the rest of the Big Six, dating back two and a half years. It is a phenomenal record.",
      "",
      "4) But Mikel Arteta knows that there will come a time when style and substance must amalgamate, when performances and results coalesce. 1-0 to the Arsenal is a fun chant, not a sustainable diet.",
      "The Spaniard’s measured post-match take was heartening, with a healthy balance of satisfaction with the result and contentment with certain aspects of the game, but an acceptance that the standard has to be much higher when the pre-season kinks are ironed out.",
      "“Twenty-two years at Old Trafford without winning before I came,” he said. “Now I go into the dressing room, we won and they’re not happy. It’s a good sign.”",
      "That mentality and the ability to grind out a result will be imperative and routinely ignored by the critics. But Arsenal have to show soon that £200m has been spent to add more feathers to their bow than set pieces in this turbocharged nuclear title war.",
      "",
      "5) Having Viktor Gyokeres up to anything resembling speed would have been useful.",
      "A challenger signing a brutish Scandinavian striker who ostensibly changes their entire style makes the comparison a bit on the nose but no less inevitable when it comes to Erling Haaland.",
      "And 21 touches with four passes completed in an hour really underpinned that same all-or-nothing narrative Gyokeres will bring to the table.",
      "The plan cannot have been for him to have more crosses or clearances than shots, although that neat centre-forward trick of relieving pressure by winning fouls on the halfway line with no teammate within 20 yards will be particularly handy when defending those narrow leads.",
      "But really – and understandably – the team’s instincts of playing with that brand of attacking spearhead were not there and will take time to develop.",
      "There were two moments when he was played in out wide, on either side and in either half, and the Sporting iteration of Gyokeres might have expected to battering ram his way inside before finishing with at least one plomb. But an overhit ball which soared over all three teammates, and a clumsy run which ended with him stepping on the ball in the area and fouling a defender, pointed to a player some way off the pace.",
      "Maybe going on strike to force a move which was always likely to happen and thus missing most of pre-season wasn’t too bright an idea. A shiny penny to whomever is first to ask whether Arsenal are better without him.",
      "",
      "6) Kai Havertz gave compelling ammunition to that question in his 30 minutes. Arsenal naturally looked smoother and more coherent when he came on but the difference in sharpness, technical levels and decision making against what came before with Gyokeres was clear.",
      "That competition and variation should only benefit Arsenal – once Gyokeres has regained the physicality which made him such an obvious addition.",
      "",
      "7) On the other end of the debutant excitement scale, those Manchester United ‘policy’ signings look proper.",
      "The Premier League premium can be excessive but the plug-in-and-play performances of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo showed why clubs charge and pay them.",
      "With no time needed to acclimatise to the league and its demands, an entire attack was transformed. Cunha and Mbeumo had as many shots as Arsenal between them, and more on target. Even Benjamin Sesko looked bright and busy in his cameo.",
      "Worra trophy indeed. And ultimately it did still end with Harry Maguire chucked up front. But it turns out spending £200m on a completely new frontline while loaning out all the previous composite parts can rejuvenate it.",
      "",
      "8) It is not worth contemplating how much needs to be spent fumigating and then rectifying their other glaring problem positions.",
      "The hosts’ midfield was semi-functional. It turns out Casemiro lacks mobility and Bruno Fernandes is often stretched across a few different roles and responsibilities. A more coherent side would have exploited the gaps Mason Mount didn’t frequently drop deep to plug.",
      "But the substitutions were revealing. Kobbie Mainoo was unused and instead Manuel Ugarte was given a half-hour cameo summed up by an atrocious shot from 30 yards out to waste some excellent Sesko link-up play.",
      "Brighton are going to extract a comical amount of money from skint Sir Jim next summer for Carlos Baleba. Whether this midfield can hang on for long enough is unknown.",
      "",
      "9) The goalkeeper situation is untenable. Leaving Andre Onana out was a choice and the justification of him having barely trained after recovering from injury stands up to reason, but when his back-up is inhibited by the exact same issues of reliability to the extent that conceding a corner is tantamount to conceding a goal regardless of who stands between the posts, investing hundreds of millions on forwards is pointless.",
      "Altay Bayindir had almost nothing to do besides – certainly in terms of saves – but flapping at that corner was a game-changing moment.",
      "",
      "10) It did not help that early in the second half, when Cunha had purchased one of his many fouls from William Saliba by the corner flag, David Raya confidently and competently punched the delivery away despite being pinned on his line among a raft of bodies.",
      "The way Raya has transitioned to becoming a genuinely brilliant keeper is not spoken of often enough, nor how Arteta absolutely nailed such a ruthless decision.",
      "There were a couple of shaky moments on the ball in his own area but also some fine saves from a man starting his hunt for a third consecutive Golden Glove in decent fettle.",
      "",
      "11) That sort of brutal, cutthroat call really might need to be made on Arsenal’s left wing at some point. If Gyokeres is going to be slightly detached from team play and judged on the quality and decisiveness of his touches rather than volume, Gabriel Martinelli cannot afford to do similar.",
      "It surely wasn’t by design that two-thirds of Arsenal’s attack were isolated but Martinelli had even fewer touches and completed passes than Gyokeres despite not even being close to the sort of peripheral player in the link-up who comes alive in front of goal.",
      "One quick break collapsed due to the Brazilian’s dreadful pass, while his opportunities to test Bayindir were snatched and wasted.",
      "Arsenal could charge a sizeable rent based on the room for improvement in that position; it really could hold them back.",

      "12) Mbeumo was electric from the first minute, when his combination of sublime touch and forearm into Martin Zubimendi’s face drew roars from the crowd.",
      "He earned bookings for both the left-backs he faced, pulled out an overhead kick and looked like he belonged.",
      "Cunha was arguably even better and that dribble from midway inside his own half through three opponents to manufacture a shot must have been manna to supporters who didn’t realise forwards were allowed to do such things.",
      "Their character and instincts are a massive upgrade on what came before. Fernandes has finally been relieved of that attacking burden, albeit at great expense.",
      "",
      "13) But where the captain fits on this ship is unknown as the issues in slotting him into this system persist. His midfield pairing with Casemiro is not viable and the duty he has to drop deep in the build up is not always beneficial.",
      "The corner Arsenal scored from was conceded unnecessarily when Fernandes played a six-yard pass backwards to Leny Yoro inside his own area as the centre-half was being closed down in plain view. Bayindir, Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu were guilty of similarly careless turnovers of possession in dangerous areas.",
      "Fernandes still created five chances because that’s what he does, but maybe £100m in exchange for a brilliant but incongruous 30-year-old wasn’t the worst deal.",
      "",
      "14) A key difference between Arsenal’s first and second-half performances could be seen through the prism of Martin Odegaard, who capitalised on those midfield spaces to complete the most take-ons of any player in the opening 45 minutes with three.",
      "Those chances were squandered but Manchester United were struggling to cope at times with his dribbling.",
      "",
      "15) Matthijs de Ligt was really good. In both boxes actually. That late block on Bukayo Saka was exceptional. He might yet start successive seasons under the same coach, the lucky sod.",

      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "Man Utd were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in their opening Premier League game of the season; an error from Altay Bayindir led to Riccardo Calafirori's goal; Andre Onana was not in the matchday squad; Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, with Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked",
      "Monday 18 August 2025 15:56, UK",
      "The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",

      "Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.",
      "Nuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",
      "Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.",
      "Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter",
      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",

But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
      "If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
