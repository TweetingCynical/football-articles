      "Ruben Amorim has revealed Manchester United have doubts over Harry Maguire and Mason Mount ahead of their clash with Brighton at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are looking to add another win to their collection after defeating Liverpool last time out.",
      "Maguire scored the winning goal against the Reds to underline his ongoing importance to Amorim's side. Mount led the line for United in the game as Arne Slot vented his frustrations at the club straying away from Benjamin Sesko for the fixture.",
      "The pair's availability is now in doubt for the Seagulls' visit, but their issues are not thought to be severe.",
      "Lisandro Martinez also remains out of action for United as he moves closer to his return. The Argentina international suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last February but is now set to be slowly reintegrated into the side.",
      "Amorim said in his press conference: \"Squad is fine, we have some doubts, some issues during the week with Maguire and Mount. Nothing serious but doubts. Licha is out.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"I don't know when he will be fit,\" Amorim added on the latter. \"He trained really well, not with us but on the next pitch and I was watching the training.",
      "\"He is feeling well and responding well so I don't want to say a specific day or one week but he is near to start training with the team and then it depends on the rythmn of Licha if he wins the place or not. That will depend on him but he is closer to a return to training.\"",
      "United's boss Amorim would not be drawn on Maguire's future with the veteran defender in the last year of his deal. The 32-year-old has impressed his boss with his influence this season, however.",
      "\"We are really happy with Harry,\" said Amorim. \"Not the time to talk about his contract because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away.",
      "\"We are really happy with Harry, he is really important for us but we just need to focus on the next game.\"",
      "\"It was good for him to play with three centre-backs, so sometimes you help players with the way you play,\" Amorim added. \"I am really pleased. He is not young, but he can learn a lot. He needs to be better with the ball. He is a massive player for us and he needs to continue.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Wayne Rooney was involved in a playful altercation with Joe Calzaghe at Paul Stretford's wedding. As the Manchester United icon celebrates his 40th birthday, he sat down on the Wayne Rooney Show with Stretford, Tony Bellew and the BBC to recount some of his fondest memories.",
      "After speaking about his time under David Moyes at Everton and how he first met boxing legend Bellew, the conversation sharply turned to an interaction Rooney once had with another famed pugilist. Stretford recalled his wedding day with a smile as he said: \"So I was looking after Joe at the time.",
      "\"So Joe came to the wedding, Wayne's there of course. And we've had a few drinks and he offers Joe Calzaghe out. I'm stood there talking to them both and he goes, 'Alright Joe.' 'Alright Wayne?' 'Could have you.'",
      "\"I'm looking and I'm thinking, 'You're joking me.' He's going, 'No, just calm down...I just want to do a bit of shadow boxing with him.' So we go out and we go onto the green outside where we were - middle of my wedding.",
      "\"So we go out and Joe's going, 'Don't worry, it's nothing.' So he goes out, first thing, so Joe's just sort of stood there. He's [Wayne's] in - to the ribs.\"",
      "With a chuckle and a hint of sarcasm, Rooney then added: \"I seen him, he was a bit vulnerable, he'd had a few drinks. Might give him his first defeat,\" alluding to Calzaghe's incredible undefeated boxing career, which spanned from 1993 to 2008.",
      "When Stretford explained he was worried that Calzaghe was going to react, Bellew added: \"As a fighter, they never react to stuff like that. But he's only just challenged the greatest fighter Britain's ever produced. Fantastic.\"",
      "To which, Stretford replied: \"But that's Wayne, eh?\" before Bellew added: \"It is. He's lively and yeah, he's even more lively if he's had a pint - as most men are, to be honest, to be fair.",
      "\"We're all the same, we're all children who have never really grown up. And Wazza's one of the biggest children I've ever met.\"",
      "Despite sharing the ring with the likes of Roy Jones Jr, Chris Eubank and Byron Mitchell over the course of his incredible career, Calzaghe retired in 2009 with an unblemished record of 46-0 with 32 knockouts.",
      "He will also be remembered as the longest-reigning super-middleweight champion in history, with 21 successful defences of his belt over the course of nine years.",
      "He also won The Ring's light-heavyweight title thanks to a split-decision win over Bernard Hopkins in 2008, defending it the same year against Jones Jr. It comes as Rooney also cleared up that he has no interest in making his way to the squared-circle for a sanctioned boxing bout of his own any time soon.",
      "When asked if he's ever been tempted, he replied: \"No, you get asked to go and do Misfits and all that. You look at Jake Paul and what he's done, he's a good boxer. KSI does well and whatever, but no. It's a bit of fun and mess around.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho's former boss Edin Terzic believes he \"can still win the Ballon d'Or\" having worked with the Manchester United flop during his time at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho left the German side to move to Old Trafford in 2021 for £72million following several impressive years in the Bundesliga. He was regularly contributing with goals and assists, but they dried up once he arrived in Manchester and he's failed to deliver on his hefty fee.",
      "His demise and well publicised clash with Erik ten Hag saw him frozen out before he was loaned back to Dortmund for six months in 2024. There he helped the Germans reach the Champions League final, shocking the likes of PSG, with Terzic masterminding his return to form.",
      "The out-of-work coach has managed the likes of Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Sancho and insists all are capable of claiming the game's top individual prize. Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa but Terzic insists he has the talent to claim the Golden Ball.",
      "He told the Telegraph: “All those players can win the Ballon d’Or in the future. Even Jadon. From the talent point of view, if you talk about Jadon then maybe five years ago you would talk about Ousmane Dembélé (who won the iy this year with PSG but also had discipline issues] in the same way.",
      "\"I am talking about the talent and potential. The difference is Erling will reach this level if he stays hungry: Jadon will only reach this level if he keeps smiling – and Jude needs to do both.\"",
      "One of the things that has marred Sancho is poor time keeping. His attitude has also been called out in the past and Terzic insists when he worked with the Englishman he tried to bring joy to his game whilst upping his professionalism. “On the pitch, I tried to reach the joy of the child in Jadon – off the pitch, the professional athlete in Jadon,\" he said.",
      "Sancho has by no means hit the ground running at Villa Park. He's yet to score following last season's spell at Chelsea, who ultimately paid a loan penalty so that they could back out of the purchase agreement they had with United.",
      "The 25-year-old was once a regular in the England picture, playing in Euro 2020, where he infamously missed a penalty in the final. He fell out of favour under Gareth Southgate and hasn't been anywhere near a recall in recent years.",
      "His attitude was called out by several United fans after he commented \"freedom\" on a social media post that showed Marcus Rashford heading for Barcelona. Villa have paid a loan fee to take Sancho for the year but he has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, with United having the option to extend for a further 12 months.",

      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has doubled down on comments made about Ruben Amorim's tactics during their 2-1 home defeat to the Red Devils last Sunday. United secured consecutive Premier League victories for the first time under Amorim last weekend at Anfield.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock after one minute on Merseyside, and Harry Maguire netted a header in the 84th minute. The loss was Liverpool's fourth in a row before they ended that streak in Wednesday's 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League.",
      "Red Devils goalkeeper Senne Lammens relieved pressure with lengthy goal kicks, and United aimed to win the second balls, as they secured their first victory at Anfield since 2016. But Slot was irked by Amorim's tactics, which were designed to make life tough for his team.",
      "Speaking after the defeat to United, Slot told BBC Sport: \"It is always difficult to play against a team that defends in a low block and mainly plays the long ball. It makes it even more difficult when you go one down after one minute when one of our players are on the floor.\"",
      "Slot was then asked to clarify his comments during an interview before Liverpool's game against Frankfurt - insisting that he was complimenting United's gameplan.",
      "\"There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment. They had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.",
      "\"It wasn’t criticism, it was me trying to explain why the game was made difficult. If you win the ball back after they’ve played it long, there are 11 players behind the ball.",
      "\"I would add that, to a certain extent, I was positive that we created as many chances as we did. Against Palace, we were able to create a lot against a low block, the same against United, but not many games since I’ve been in charge have we been able to create many chances against a 5-4-1 low block.",
      "\"It wasn’t meant as a criticism at all. It was a very smart game plan and certainly their last three signings – two of them for sure – had an impact on the game, in Cunha and Mbeumo.\"",
      "The Dutchman has been asked about those comments again before Saturday evening's trip to Brentford in the Premier League. Slot has doubled down on his assertion that comments made by him about United were misinterpreted.",
      "\"It was meant to be a compliment to the opposing manager finding a way to play against us, but I don't think it has come across like that,\" he said.",
      "The Reds will be looking to avoid a fourth straight league defeat when they travel to the Gtech Community Stadium this weekend. Slot's side could close the gap to leaders Arsenal down to one point before the Gunners host Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, will be seeking a third straight victory when they host Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford on Saturday. The Red Devils will also be hoping to avoid a fourth consecutive league defeat at home to the Seagulls, having failed to beat them at M16 since February 2022.",

      "The youngster has been dubbed 'Kid Messi' and likened to Neymar as interest in the attacker reaches fever-pitch. This season, Gabriel has been a regular in Darren Fletcher's under-18 side.",
      "After grabbing a hat-trick against Derby County in August, Gabriel has netted seven goals in six games in the older age group. Some are starting to wonder when his Premier League debut will come.",
      "But there will be a long wait as Gabriel is not permitted to feature until next season, even though Arsenal ace Max Dowman, 15, has featured for the Gunners. Premier League rules state that players must be 15 by August 31 to play in the same campaign, with Gabriel only turning 15 earlier this month.",
      "The same cut-off is set to keep Gabriel out of FA Youth Cup action too. Players have to be born before the cut-off date of 31 August 2010.",
      "Nevertheless, Gabriel will be surrounded by United's senior stars as he continues his development. The young goalscorer will train with Amorim's side throughout the season and has participated in the club's preparations to face Brighton.",
      "Gabriel was handed a two-year deal at Old Trafford in June, and United's technical director Jason Wilcox is understood to have taken an active role in convincing the teenager to stay. Amorim is also following his progress closely, having been impressed.",
      "United appear to be on the charm offensive for their prodigious talent and Gabriel watched the opening game of the season, a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, from the directors' box at Old Trafford. It is said that Gabriel has been offered his own box at United's prospective £2billion stadium that the club hope to have completed by 2030.",

      "United want to avoid any chance of Gabriel's head being turned with clubs abroad able to soon eye his services. The 15-year-old is the son of former Republic of Ireland international Joe O'Cearuill and holds an Irish passport.",
      "As a result, he would be allowed to move to a European club from the age of 16 rather than 18 years old, and the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are tempted, according to Goal.",
      "Despite his tender age, Gabriel already has a sponsorship deal with Nike after strong competition from rivals Adidas.",
      "Gabriel is a team-mate of Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, who is also 15. The pair were stars of United's under-19 squad that played in Mladen Ramljak Tournament in Croatia in August.",

Because in his first 11 months as manager, Amorim has come to appreciate what it takes to succeed at one of the world's biggest clubs.",

      "The international break had finished, but Amorim had told his squad to report back 24 hours later, on the Friday, to work on preparations for the daunting trip to Anfield to face Liverpool. But Cunha reported earlier than expected, and could be seen doing a light gym session on his own.",

      "Manchester United's summer signing Senne Lammens has been turning heads at Old Trafford since his move from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian goalkeeper made a solid start to his United tenure with a clean sheet in his debut match, a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, before the international break.",
      "He was then trusted by boss Ruben Amorim to guard the net during their trip to Anfield last weekend. United clinched a 2-1 win against Arne Slot's team, marking their first consecutive victories under the Portuguese manager who took charge nearly a year ago.",
      "However, insiders at Old Trafford have advised patience with the young Belgian, pointing out a few shaky moments in his initial games, according to The Sun.",
      "Lammens had a close shave in the Sunderland match when he rushed out to intercept Black Cats' winger Bertrand Traore and collided with teammate Bruno Fernandes. Despite some contact with Traore, the officials dismissed any penalty claims.",
      "In the Liverpool match, Lammens had a bit of a blunder when he dropped the ball in the first half. But club staff have praised his composed response to these minor setbacks.",
      "His steady presence in goal has been a breath of fresh air after Andre Onana's unpredictable style and Altay Bayindir's mistakes. The Sun reports that the transfer fee for Lammens was reasonable enough to allow the club to bring in a more seasoned goalkeeper if needed.",
      "United supporters have been blown away by Lammens' displays so far and have drawn comparisons to iconic goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel through songs from the stands.",
      "\"Senne did a great job [against Sunderland],\" Amorim told reporters when asked about the Belgian's Premier League debut. \"It is possible he is going to start the game [against Liverpool]. The first impression in this club is really important, to maintain the level is really important and difficult.",
      "\"He is not Schmeichel. He is a young guy, he showed a lot of composure and the fans like him. He needs to show himself.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has also sung Lammens' praises and lauded the influence he's already had on United's backline.",
      "\"Talk about him... what I would say is, again, when I look back at when I played, when did I feel my best? When I didn't have to look behind me and worry about what the keeper might do or where he might be,\" Ferdinand said on his podcast.",
      "\"I wasn't second-guessing anything about my goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar is a great example, a fantastic goalkeeper, a calming influence and just so reassuring seeing that behind you.",
      "\"I think what people don't grasp, how important a goalkeeper is because he sends the vibrations through the team, his good vibrations reverberate through the team, the confidence, security, assuredness, confidence, any type of wavering from that to uncertainty and not sure what he's going to do.",
      "\"Them looks over there [behind him] means that I'm not concentrating on where I am here. If I'm doing that [looking behind] often and worrying, that looks becomes a little bit longer because the picture in front of me has changed.",
      "\"A lot of that was happening, the uncertainty with defenders especially mistakes being made before, it was leading to real uncertainty in the team and you see the way the lads celebrated [with Senne Lammens], it's only his second game by the way.",
      "\"It'd almost been like he'd been there a couple of years, it was like, 'this is what we do'. It was so nice to see that togetherness and the celebrations are key for me, a marker, it can be over the top and forced but there was an aggression, a 'let's go' and I hope that's what we're going to see.\"",

      "Leeds United host West Ham in the opening game on Friday night, with both teams looking to bounce back after losing last time out. The Whites were beaten 2-0 in what was billed as a six-pointer against Burnley, while the Hammers suffered a damning 2-0 defeat at home to Brentford.",
      "There is no 12:30pm kick-off on Saturday due to Liverpool's involvement in the Champions League on Wednesday, meaning the Reds face Brentford at 8pm on the same day. Chelsea take on Sunderland and Newcastle face Fulham at 3pm, while Manchester United entertain Brighton at Old Trafford at 5:30pm.",
      "Liverpool are looking to follow up their midweek thumping at Eintracht Frankfurt and record another win on the road, Chelsea and Sunderland lock horns after both teams won their most recent game, while Newcastle won at home in Europe on Tuesday and Fulham were beaten at Arsenal in a close game last Saturday.",
      "It leaves five games to be played on Sunday, with table-toppers Arsenal, looking to make it SEVEN wins in a row across all competitions, among those in action at 2pm against Crystal Palace.",
      "Aston Villa and Manchester City go head-to-head, Wolves face Burnley in a crucial game near the bottom and Nottingham Forest, fresh off the back of a first win in charge for Sean Dyche, head to Bournemouth in the other 2pm fixtures. Everton then host Tottenham in the final game of the weekend at 4:30pm.",
      "Below are Shearer's full predictions for this weekend's Premier League matches courtesy of Betfair...",
      "Leeds were beaten at Burnley last weekend, after dominating possession and shots - Burnley only had 31% possession but still beat Leeds.",
      "Leeds are a different outfit at home, at Elland Road, and it was pretty shambolic the way that West Ham fell apart on Monday night at home to Brentford.",
      "They realised there that they've got a massive problem and whether they'd be able to get out of it, I'm not sure. So, because of that atmosphere, I would go for a home win to Leeds this week.",
      "The reason Nuno is at West Ham is because of how poor it was - when he's walked into West Ham, I'm pretty sure he realises he's got a big job to turn that around.",
      "There's ill feeling towards the owners. You can feel the gripe in the stands; the fans aren't happy with the situation and with the owners - Nuno knows he's got a big job on his hands to fix what's wrong with West Ham.",
      "I guess that's one of the reasons why so many clubs are pressing the panic button this year. They're looking at Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland and for the first time in a while all thinking that those promoted clubs might have what it takes to stay up this year.",
      "Other clubs have reacted to that situation, namely West Ham and Forest.",
      "Prediction - Leeds win",
      "Sunderland have been amazing, three wins and a draw at home - I do think that's going to be the key to them this season. It doesn't take a genius to work that out.",
      "They've had an unbelievable start to the season and are in seventh place. I don't see that continuing, but they'll have to enjoy it while it's there, but I think Chelsea might be too much on Saturday.",
      "Prediction - Chelsea win",
      "I would hope Newcastle can get back to winning ways at home after what happened in midweek and with the options that Eddie Howe's got, as well as the belief.",
      "They need to go on a bit of a run in the league, and I would hope that starts this weekend - I'm going to be at the game on Saturday. Newcastle should have too much for Fulham.",
      "I don't think Fulham will finish 15th, they'll be around about mid-table - they've had a tough start, but let's hope that tough start continues at the weekend.",
      "Prediction - Newcastle win",
      "This is a tough one to call. Last weekend, Man Utd had an amazing result at Liverpool with Brighton deservedly beating Newcastle.",
      "Brighton are a good team, they create chances and look very well organised. I'm going to go for a draw on this one. It might not be a bad result for both clubs.",
      "Prediction - Draw",
      "Liverpool need to stop the rot - the pressures on them hugely. They cannot have another defeat in the league, or their title push might be over. I know that would be early to say that, but that's what it could come down to if they were to be beaten again.",
      "I would expect them to pick up and to be hurting from last weekend's criticism, as well as because of what they did in the Champions League - looking something near to their best, probably their best performance of the season.",
      "Whether Isak's fit and whether he's got decisions to make with regards to Mo Salah or not, we'll have to wait and see.",
      "I would think Liverpool going there after this week, I think they might actually take the points - as tough as it may be.",
      "Prediction - Liverpool win",
      "Palace played on Thursday night, in Europe, so with Arsenal playing their game on Tuesday that's a big factor as well.",
      "Even as good a team as Palace are, as good a forward Mateta is, just looking at Arsenal in midweek and the way they can shift it around with two or three players - they'll have too much for Palace.",
      "The extra days' rest is massive going into such a big game, and it's an away game. I know they don't have to travel and it's in London, but you'd be amazed at how the atmosphere at home can pull you and drag you through.",
      "Prediction - Arsenal win",
      "It was a tough start for Villa, but they've turned things around. Maybe the same for Man City, so it's a tough one to call.",
      "Everything depends on Haaland for City, and the way he's scoring goals it's really difficult to go against Man City when he's in the form he's in. But Villa Park will be rocking - it's a tough place to go.",
      "I will go for a score draw.",
      "Prediction - Draw",
      "I think Forest have done it early in terms of the change again, but I think that if there's one guy that can go in there, show them up, have them really well organised and go back to some sort of way they used to play last season - it's Sean Dyche.",
      "Having said that, Bournemouth are flying and particularly being at home they will have too much for Forest. They got a result last week at Palace - Kroupi got two on his first start and they were a tad unlucky not to take three points.",
      "Bournemouth will have too much for Forest. It's a tough start for Dyche and his staff, Forest host Porto on Thursday night, but the turnaround for Bournemouth with the whole week to prepare means I'll say home win.",
      "Prediction - Bournemouth win",
      "This could be a standout game for Wolves. If they were to be beaten at home by Burnley, then you would have to fear the worst.",
      "They have to start getting results and if it doesn't start this weekend, then you'd fear the worst. Burnley will be stubborn, make it frustrating for them - I'm not convinced with Wolves and I'm not sure they've got enough.",
      "It would be crazy for Wolves to have signed Vitor Pereira on a new contract three or four weeks ago and then sack him. It was supposed to give him a position of confidence, but I imagine they're still shocked and surprised that they're yet to win a game.",
      "The atmosphere may change if Burnley beat them. But I will go with a draw.",
      "Prediction - Draw",
      "Spurs have had to travel, so I guess from that perspective it will be a tough one. Jack Grealish will be back for Everton - they missed him last week at City.",
      "I think with Everton at home it's difficult to go against them, even if it's against a Champions League team. I just think with Spurs playing a really tough game in Monaco, then travelling to Everton is tough so I'm going to go for a home win.",
      "Prediction - Everton win",

      "Manchester United's Amad has shed light on the burgeoning partnership he is forming with Bryan Mbeumo on the right flank, following their triumphant win over Liverpool. The pair were in the starting line-up on Sunday, with Amad taking up the right wing-back position and Mbeumo operating as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Their chemistry was evident within the first two minutes of the game when Amad delivered a stunning through ball to the former Brentford player, leading to the opening goal. The 23-year-old feels that they are developing a strong bond both on and off the field.",
      "\"At the beginning, because he was a new player, we were trying to understand each other,\" he shared with MUTV. \"But now we find a solution: when he goes to right wing-back, I go as a No.10. When he plays as a No.10, I stay as a right wing-back.",
      "\"I think now we have a very good relationship, even outside the pitch. This is very important, not only to have a good relationship in the pitch, but also to have a good relationship outside the pitch, to put some things [together].",
      "\"A player has to be ready to play every position. I'm just here to give my best every game.",
      "\"If Bryan plays No.10, I am so happy and, if I play No.10, I'm so happy. But, for me, the most important thing is helping the team. If we win, we are very happy.",
      "\"It's nice. We've got good players and big talents. We knew already that Bryan, with Brentford, what he did with them was big things. So we tried to bring him here to do the same and he is doing the same.",
      "\"We are really happy for him because he's a humble guy, a really nice guy. I hope he can help us to score more goals, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Mbeumo has netted three times for the Reds following his summer switch from Brentford. Amad, meanwhile, has continued his fine form from last season with two assists from his seven matches so far.",
      "United presently occupy ninth spot in the Premier League standings and could climb towards the European qualification spots with three points against Brighton this weekend.",

      "Alan Shearer has backed Harry Maguire to potentially earn a space in the England squad for next year's World Cup. The Red Devils defender has been in fine form under Ruben Amorim this season, playing a key role in recent victories over Sunderland and Liverpool.",
      "Despite currently being out of favour with Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel, Newcastle United legend Shearer is confident that it may not be long before Maguire is back in the national set-up. In conversation with Betfair, Shearer said: \"I think Maguire's got an amazing attitude; I love how nothing seems to affect him - he goes out and you know what you're going to get.",
      "\"You know he gives his all - he may make an error every now and then, but who doesn't? I love his attitude towards that, whether it's going well or not.",
      "\"I suppose he can make a late play for the England squad - knowing his attitude, he'd never rule it out. He's got to get in, stay in and be a regular in the Man United team to show what we saw last weekend, every weekend.",
      "\"I guess the answer is that you could never rule it out and I don't think he would either. He would expect if he was to continue playing the way he is, then he might get it. He might get the call-up, you never know.\"",
      "Reflecting on being left out, Maguire said at the time: \"To miss out was tough. It has been really frustrating, working all season to get myself mentally and physically at the top of my game and be in a position to feel I could really make a difference for Manchester United and my country.\"",
      "Whilst he hasn't pulled on the England shirt since last September's Nations League triumph over Ireland, many believe the 32-year-old could earn a recall for Tuchel's maiden major tournament with England at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Maguire has been a standout performer in Amorim's team lately, featuring in seven Premier League matches this season. The defender came off the bench to help secure a 2-0 victory against Sunderland at Old Trafford before the international break, then started in the dramatic 2-1 triumph over bitter rivals Liverpool last weekend.",
      "In that encounter, Maguire netted the decisive goal with a commanding header at the far post, demonstrating how he retains the ability to influence matches despite approaching the latter stages of his career. The spotlight will be on the centre-half as Manchester United welcome Brighton to their home ground on Saturday evening.",
      "As it stands, Brighton are just one point and one position behind United in 10th, thanks to a varied start to their own season. However, they enter the fray with momentum, having not lost in their last four Premier League matches.",

      "Wayne Rooney turns 40 today meaning it is more than 23 years since a fresh faced 16-year-old marked his arrival by scoring a last minute winner for Everton to down then champions Arsenal on an October afternoon in 2002.",
      "Little did we know that it would herald the beginning of a career for a player that would go on to break teenage transfer fees, light up an international tournament and surpass Manchester United, England and Everton goalscoring records.",
      "Clive Tyldesley, the commentator at Goodison Park that day remarked: \"Remember the name...Wayne Rooney!\"",
      "As introductions go it was an emphatic one and, unlike so many teenage players before and after him, this wasn't a case of lighting the touch paper only to underwhelm in later years. Rooney would deliver, deliver and deliver across the next two decades.",
      "Everton were always going to struggle to keep up with Rooney's ambitions and, even though he inspired them to a seventh place finish that year, bigger and better things were not far away. His England debut came at Upton Park in a loss to Australia on February 12 2003 at 17 years and 111 days - making him the youngest ever Three Lions player.",
      "The Toffees can boast about having the best young player at a major tournament, something they may never do again. Euro 2004 was the stage on which Rooney truly got Europe and the world's attention as he starred for England en route to the last eight. The teenager tore the French defence apart, scored against Switzerland and Croatia before injury ended a tournament of what might have beens.",
      "It was a few weeks though which would ultimately make Sir Alex Ferguson decide to push the go button and, after a transfer battle with Newcastle, Rooney would move to Old Trafford for £27million. It made him the world's most expensive teenager at the time.",
      "Ferguson had claimed that he'd landed a player who he felt would make any United team, even the one that had won the treble in 1999. Injury meant United fans had to wait to see their latest superstar in action, but he didn't disappoint and patience truly was a virtue.",
      "Rooney's debut in Manchester would come in the Champions League. He needed just 17 minutes to score his first goal, which was one of three as he notched a hat-trick to down Fenerbahce and truly announce himself to his new supporters.",
      "Playing at Old Trafford served as the springboard to take Rooney to some stellar individual honours. The Englishman was named the PFA Young Player of the Year in successive years in 2005 and 2006. Only three players this century have achieved the feat.",
      "But whilst the brilliance was often on show it wasn't being backed up by trophies. Rooney began his third year in Manchester and the best he had to show for it was a runners-up medal from the FA Cup final in 2005. Chelsea, who were keen on signing Rooney back in the day, had become England's dominant force.",
      "That was all about to change as the 2006/07 season began, but whilst it soon led to the second Holy Trinity in United's famed history, it would begin an era that would see Rooney play second fiddle as Cristiano Ronaldo morphed into one of the world's greatest players.",
      "It came after a World Cup in 2006 when Rooney and Ronaldo clashed on the pitch in a quarter-final where Portugal again came out on top. Rooney was sent-off, many claiming his United team-mate played a central role in that dismissal. A wink to the camera did little to help the situation. But it was another case of Rooney's hot-headed temper getting the better of him.",
      "He and Ronaldo didn't seem to have an issue on the pitch though and three years after Rooney moved to Manchester he claimed a first Premier League title during a year in which he dovetailed with Ronaldo brilliantly. The duo teamed up to score one of the great counter-attacking goals in top flight history during a 4-1 win over Bolton.",
      "That campaign also marked the first time that Rooney had exceeded the 20-goal mark. The success was the beginning of a three-year spell that saw Ferguson pick up a hat-trick of titles for the second time. That phase also included back-to-back Champions League finals - winning in 2008 in Moscow before losing to Barcelona the following year.",
      "Rooney was one third of a frontline that also included Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. It was a hark back to the days of George Best, Sir Bobby Charlton and Dennis Law. Few teams in Europe, let alone England, could compete with their brilliance.",
      "The Champions League final loss in 2009 marked the end of an era. Ronaldo would leave for Real Madrid in a world-record move, but that would be Rooney's sliding doors moment. Ever since he'd arrived at the club he'd never been the out and out main man.",
      "When he rocked up, Ruud van Nistelrooy was still central to the attack and after his exit Ronaldo quickly emerged. Come the 2009/10 season though Rooney was the main man, no question. It was a responsibility that saw him thrive - backed up by the numbers.",
      "He would score 34 times in all competitions - a career high - en route to his only PFA Player of the Year award. United, now without Ronaldo and Tevez, would miss out on the title but Rooney's stock had never been higher.",
      "53 – Goals for England, a national team record until surpassed by Harry Kane (76).",
      "120 – England caps, a record for an outfield player, five short of Peter Shilton’s overall record.",
      "253 – Club-record goal tally for Manchester United.",
      "208 – Goals scored in the Premier League. Only Alan Shearer (260) and Kane (213) have scored more.",
      "16 – Rooney was 16 years and 360 days old when he scored his first Premier League goal, for Everton against Arsenal in October 2002, making him then the youngest goalscorer in the competition’s history.",
      "12 – Major honours won with Manchester United – five Premier League titles, three League Cups, an FA Cup, a Champions League, a Europa League and a FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "4 – Professional clubs represented – Everton, Manchester United, DC United and Derby.",
      "366 – career goals for club and country, in 883 games.",
      "25.3 – Rooney’s win percentage as a manager, with Derby, DC United, Birmingham and Plymouth.",
      "40 – matches in his last two managerial spells combined. He was sacked by Birmingham after less than three months, having won just two games out of 15, then won five out of 25 with Argyle.",
      "It all meant that excitement among England fans was peaking ahead of the World Cup in 2010. Fabio Capello had the team purring and they were among the favourites to win the tournament. An underwhelming 1-1 draw with America was followed by a goalless draw with Algeria, where England looked poor. Fans made their feelings known and the camera panned to Rooney at full-time as he let loose.",
      "\"Nice to see your own fans booing you, you football 'supporters',\" he remarked. The heat was on him. A win over Slovenia meant England made it into the last 16, but there they were hammered by Germany to end a tournament that will not be looked upon positively in history.",
      "Despite the international disappointment, at club level Rooney was the talisman and perhaps that is why he felt he had the stature to go in and ask Ferguson what his plans was in the transfer market. It was a conversation that would get heated, leading to an argument with the Scot as his authority was questioned. Rooney would then hand in a transfer request as he called the club's ambition into question. Years later he stands by his approach. \"I still think I had a right to ask the question,\" he said recently.",
      "Rooney would later reconcile with Ferguson, agreeing a new deal that would see him stay at United for his peak years. The Premier League success of 2013 would be his last before David Moyes, his manager at Everton, was appointed to replace Ferguson as the Manchester managerial merry-go-round began.",
      "Rooney played under three managers in his final four years in Manchester, which saw him claim a further three major trophies. The landmark moment of his career came in January 2017. He scored at Stoke to surpass Sir Charlton’s all-time goalscoring record, stepping up four minutes into stoppage time to score his 250th goal for the club with a stunning free-kick.",
      "It was the second major record Rooney had to his name. In 2015 he became England's all-time leading goalscorer after scoring his 50th international goal in a 2-0 win over Switzerland at Wembley. He would end his Three Lions career with 53 international goals.",
      "But the man who looked destined to conquer the world at Euro 2004 never delivered on that promise. England would lose in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012, fail to make it out of the group at the World Cup in 2014 and endured the embarrassment of a last 16 loss to Iceland at Euro 2016 - Rooney's final major tournament.",
      "The striker left Manchester in the summer of 2017 with a total of 253 goals to his name, returning to Everton for a year. It was a feel good homecoming, but ultimately a short-lived once as he headed to the MLS with DC United before heading to Championship side Derby, which began his route into management.",
      "Rooney has now had four managerial gigs and, it is fair to say the jury is still out. If anything its veering against him. Plenty of England's recent 'Golden Generation' have turned their hand at management with mixed results.",
      "Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard are among those to swap the pitch for the dugout following retirement. But the United legend has a CV that's seen him preside over Derby's relegation, albeit one influenced by huge points deductions and a lack of funds.",
      "A return to DC United provided a chance to make a name for himself away from the English spotlight, but he won just 14 of 53 games before mutually leaving the MLS outfit. Just four days after that exit and Birmingham City, newly taken over by an American consortium, trusted Rooney to lead their drive up the football pyramid.",
      "Instead quite the opposite occurred. Rooney's two wins from 15 games pushed Birmingham into a relegation battle, one they couldn't overcome. The Championship drop zone has become an unwanted home for Rooney. After Derby and Birmingham he took over at Plymouth.",
      "The Pilgrims would follow a familiar pattern and, even though they sacked Rooney midway through the season, he'd left the new manager with plenty to do and they now find themselves in League One.",
      "Wife Coleen, who Rooney has been with since school, wasn't sold on Rooney taking over at Plymouth. Rumours claim she also struggled when her husband had his managerial stint in America.",
      "Despite a number of off-field scandals that have seen Rooney placed on the front page, as well as the back page, she's stuck by him. Among the England icon's issues were alcohol abuse and he recently told his friend and former teammate Rio Ferdinand he would \"drink for two days straight\" at the peak of his career.",
      "Rooney admitted his 39-year-old wife \"helped me control that massively\" and \"managed me because I needed managing\". \"I honestly believe, if she weren't there, I'd be dead,\" he said.",
      "The footballer turned manager has attributed Coleen with making huge interventions during his life. He said: \"I've made mistakes in the past which are well documented and whatever but I'm a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path and she's done it for 20-odd years.\"",

      "Alan Shearer believes Marcus Rashford has had to change his attitude while on loan at Barcelona. The England international joined the La Liga heavyweights on a season-long loan deal over the summer after Ruben Amorim made it clear he had no place in his plans at Manchester United.",
      "Barcelona have an option to make the switch permanent for £30million in 2026 and are said to be keen on keeping him beyond this campaign, albeit at a reduced fee. The 27-year-old has rediscovered his best form at the Camp Nou, bagging four goals and laying on six assists in all competitions under Hansi Flick this term.",

      "Most people would expect Wayne Rooney to celebrate a landmark birthday with a night on the tiles. Because no-one's reputation has preceded a sportsman quite like Rooney's has.",
      "Just last month the England and Manchester United legend opened up on his alcohol addiction, admitting he could have died if it hadn't been for the help and support of his wife Coleen. But people change. People grow up. People learn from their mistakes. Even those who have lived out most of their lives in the public spotlight.",
      "So those same people who still wait for the next mistake or bad decision from Rooney to hit the headlines, will be surprised to know one of England's greatest ever footballers is welcoming in his 40th birthday working in Dubai. Rooney has taken his family to the UAE, where he is holding some coaching clinics with star struck kids.",
      "Is it really 24 years ago Rooney introduced himself to English football with a stunning goal for Everton against Arsenal at Goodison Park? He was 16 - and life felt sweet.",
      "Not least when he went on to join United - and elevated himself to becoming the greatest player of his generation. A teenage tearaway from Croxteth who became a global superstar.",
      "His moments of magic were relentless and stunning. He scared defenders to death. He took teams apart on his own - and became a talisman for both club and country.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Rooney became England and United's greatest ever goalscorer. And he remains England's most capped outfield player. But with all the brilliance came some bad choices.",
      "He could go from sweet to sour in the blink of an eye, making headlines on the front pages as well as the back. For a decade, he was one of the most famous and infamous footballers on the planet.",
      "Since retirement he has tried his hand at management, and is now forging a successful career as a pundit. He has his own BBC podcast, and is an integral part of the 'Match of the Day' team. His views are engaging and intelligent, spawned from a playing career which saw his footballing brain work faster than most of those he came up against.",
      "His long-time agent, Paul Stretford, has been on the rollercoaster ride from the beginning. Stratford still believes Rooney remains underrated, but is proud of the man he has now become.",
      "He said: \"Look back to that day he signed his first major professional contract with Everton and his introduction to the world and the media. Then see the person that stands there now, who is aware of his place in the world and he’s self-assured of what that place is.",
      "\"I don't think too many people gave much chance of that being the case all of those years ago. He’s faced demons, he’s faced challenges, but each and every step along the way, whenever they’ve come along, he’s faced them full on and dealt with them and come out the other side.",
      "\"I think he's been under-appreciated throughout his career and it’s the misfortune of being on both ends of the paper, both the front and back pages. That undoubtedly shaped opinion in the formative stages and even to this day.",
      "\"Coleen has been such a rock for Wayne and the family generally, and now they can spend more time together and enjoy that aspect of their life.",
      "\"I would say at 40 he’s ended up very much in a good place, whereas a lot of us at 40 are thinking, ‘Oh, well, that’s my young days gone, it’s all downhill from here’.",
      "\"Do you know what he’ll be doing on his birthday? He’ll be coaching kids in Dubai.",
      "\"The beauty of it is he can take Coleen and the kids for half-term, but what he’s doing is he’s got his boots on, he’s on the grass, where he loves best, coaching kids.”",

      "The keeper was anticipated to claim the number one spot in goal and following an adjustment period, he made his bow against Sunderland in a 2-0 triumph. Lammens kept a clean sheet on his debut and delivered a vital yet low-key performance in United's 2-1 success over Liverpool last weekend.",
      "His personality mirrors this quiet approach. He has allegedly forbidden any talk of clean sheets before matches as he considers it unlucky. This superstition extends to team-mates and relatives.",
      "Double Premier League winner Lescott has encouraged Lammens to maintain his inconspicuous presence as this signals excellent goalkeeping displays.",
      "\"I think defensive players and goalkeepers, the more unnoticed they go in the game, the better they're performing,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",

      "\"If you're not talking about Lammens, it's a good thing. It's a positive. I think after like five or six games, all of a sudden, 'Oh, he's been in goal.' Then you're like, 'Yeah, he has done all right.'",
      "\"It's the same with defenders. I mean, when you hear their names in the press, they're up to no good. They have either scored or they've been sent off. I don't want that. I just want to go under the radar.\"",
      "Lammens wasn't the sole new arrival that caught Lescott's eye during the clash with Liverpool. Matheus Cunha, who joined Old Trafford for £62.5m this summer, operated as a central striker at Anfield and troubled the Reds' backline.",
      "It was his movement without the ball that particularly impressed Lescott. He added: \"Cunha showed that it's important that forward strikers score but highlighted the importance of their role.",
      "\"Ball retention, I think that it is probably one of the most underrated things a striker has to do and be good at. Do you know what I mean?",

      "Wayne Rooney is unable to watch his son, Kai, play for Manchester United due to his own intense fame. The teenager, 15, is the oldest child of Rooney and wife Coleen, who share three other younger sons - Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, a forward like his legendary father, joined the academy of the Red Devils in 2016 as he followed in the footsteps of Rooney Sr, who celebrates his 40th birthday today. While there's a long way to go for the teen in his journey to the top-flight, he is regarded as a highly-rated talent at Old Trafford.",
      "Unfortunately for the ex-England captain, he'll have to watch his matches from a distance after it was revealed the budding young talent told his father that he's not allowed to go to his games, because of the sheer amount of attention he receives.",
      "The revelation was made public during Coleen's time on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old finished runner-up in the popular reality show to McFly singer Danny Jones and it was when she was in camp that she opened up about the sad decision her son opted to make.",
      "\"That’s the thing with kids I think, it’s hard to go on days out,\" Coleen said last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn’t even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, ‘Go away, I'm watching my son?’ Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, ‘Oh, dad there’s no point you coming because you don’t even watch me play anyway.’ Which is sad, but it can’t be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "While he may not be on the touchline while Kai is in action, he still plays a huge role in his footballing education. Rooney previously admitted he tends to leave the coaching to the club's staff but makes sure to pass off words of wisdom to his sons when practising at home.",
      "It was during last month's edition of The Wayne Rooney Show that the 40-year-old said: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he said to Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Given Kai's status as the son of one of England's greatest-ever players, Rooney praised his mental strength for dealing with added pressure and attention that comes with being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney said to BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim and Manchester United will aim to maintain their momentum when they face Brighton on Saturday. The Portuguese manager's side pulled off a brilliant win against rivals Liverpool last time out.",
      "Despite a dire start to the season, United's results have begun to improve. They have won three of their last four league matches and calls for head coach Amorim to be replaced have have quietened – for the time being, at least.",
      "Their 2-1 victory at Anfield last weekend seemed to be a turning point and it is hoped this momentum can carry forward to their clash with the Seagulls. Matheus Cunha, who arrived this summer for £62.5million from Wolves, impressed on Merseyside.",
      "Cunha played a pivotal role in United's victory over Liverpool and head coach Amorim explained why after the clash. He said: \"Sometimes the characteristics of the game change the way you are going to approach the game, so I think, for example, Cunha in the middle.",
      "\"If we put Ben [Sesko], I think it's easier for these centre-backs to control our striker. Especially in the bad moments, you have to go with your gut. And I always go by that, no matter what.\"",
      "As well as making an impact on the field, it appears Cunha is doing the same off it. According to The Sun, the Brazilian has cut a friendly figure behind the scenes and is providing good for morale at Old Trafford. They claim that Cunha has been well received by members of staff and is very pleasant to all, while one source said he has been \"great around the place.\"",
      "It is also said he has struck up a friendship with Luke Shaw and is much more extroverted than fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford.",
      "Cunha's international team-mate Casemiro started the match at Anfield and wasn't afraid to dish out some heavy challenges. Just before the hour mark, he went into the book and he was replaced by Manuel Ugarte a minute later.",
      "The holding midfielder has started six of United's eight league games but has been no stranger to a booking. So far, he has been shown three yellow cards and was sent off in the win against Chelsea after being booked twice.",
      "Casemiro missed the loss against Brentford as he served a one-match suspension but Amorim could soon be given another headache to deal with. The Brazilian has technically been shown five yellows this season already.",
      "Aside from the Chelsea and Liverpool cards, he was also shown a yellow in the win against Sunderland and the draw against Fulham. He is now in the somewhat risky predicament of only needing two more cautions for another one-match ban. He will have until the 19th game of the season to avoid two bookings too, which is a tall order for a player of his tendencies.",
      "Harry Maguire bagged a late winner against Liverpool, which capped off an impeccable performance at the back. The English defender has endured tough spells at Old Trafford and Peter Crouch claims he's been made a villain.",
      "\"I'm just really, really pleased for Maguire,\" Crouch said on That Peter Crouch Podcast. \"Throughout my career, there have been points where I've been low and I've had a lot of grief, a lot of stick, so I kind of know what that's like.",
      "\"For him to get that amount of grief, it was above and beyond what is acceptable, I think. Attacking his family, his personality, the way he looks, everything was wrong about the way he's been villainised at that club.",
      "\"I just think it shows absolutely massive b******s to consistently go [and perform]. Even the game against Liverpool, it was like, 'Ah, why is he playing?' There's always this whole thing of being down on him starting.\"",

      "Roy Keane discovered a new level of respect for Wayne Rooney after the striker stood his ground against the formidable captain early in his Manchester United career. Despite Keane's reputation as a tough leader, Rooney did not seem as daunted as some of his new teammates.",
      "United paid an initial £20million, which later rose to £27m, for Rooney after he demonstrated his world-class ability for England during Euro 2004. The young striker had already made waves in the Premier League with his spectacular goal for Everton against Arsenal in October 2002 and his career only continued to soar at United.",
      "Despite the high-profile transfer, Rooney took it all in stride, even scoring a Champions League hat-trick on his debut in a 6-2 victory over Fenerbahce. His fearlessness extended beyond the pitch, as former United captain Keane recalled an incident where the young forward cheekily wound him up during an early away trip.",
      "The event occurred on the eve of United's 3-1 away win over Newcastle in November 2004. Keane was watching rugby on TV in the team hotel when he briefly left the room, only to return and find that someone had changed the channel.",
      "When Keane confronted his teammates, no one confessed until Rooney stepped forward on the morning of the match. However, it proved to be a rare row between the two United icons.",
      "\"We were in a hotel, the Friday night before a game – I forget where,\" Keane explained in his 2014 autobiography The Second Half. \"The team would always sit down and have a meal together. There was a big TV in the room.",
      "\"I was into rugby league, and there was a big game on. I went to the toilet, came back and someone had changed the channel to something stupid. I can't remember what it was. A few of the players were sitting there, giggling away.",
      "\"I said, 'Where's the rugby league?' I knew Wayne was up to something. I said, 'Where's the remote control?' He said, 'I don't know.' I said, 'You f****** do'. I didn't exactly storm out, but I couldn't be bothered trying to get the remote control back, so I decided I'd watch the rest of the match up in my room.",
      "\"I came down the next morning for the pre-match meal and Wayne was brave enough to come up to me. 'Did you ever find the remote control, Roy?' I think I told him to go and f*** himself. It was the only disagreement I ever had with him.\"",
      "The wind-up appeared to help bring the duo closer together. Rooney shared similar memories to Keane, though United's record goalscorer believed the clash actually improved how the captain saw him.",
      "\"I always remember my first away trip, having that argument with Roy Keane,\" Rooney recalled in 2018. \"We were watching the rugby before we were playing Newcastle away.",
      "\"He went to get some food, so I put X-Factor on and hid the remote. He wasn't happy about it and we had an argument. But I think straight away, he respected me more for standing up to him.\"",
      "This unconventional pre-match routine seemed to work wonders for Rooney, who bagged a double at St James' Park, with Ruud van Nistelrooy also scoring from the spot. Rooney's debut season saw him net 17 times in all competitions, helping United to a third-place finish in the league and reaching the FA Cup final, where they were defeated by Arsenal on penalties.",

      "Before Alejandro Garnacho made the decision to swap Manchester United for Chelsea, ex-Red Devil Paul Parker made it clear he thought the move was bad for the Argentine and the Blues. Garnacho, 20, severed all ties at Old Trafford when he publicly criticised Ruben Amorim's choice to side-line him for the Europa League final.",
      "The United boss, furious with Garnacho lashing out at him so publicly, reportedly told him, in front of team-mates: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer.\"",
      "Garnacho did eventually get his move to west London, which was secured through a £40million deal. However, he has yet to make a significant impact, failing to score or assist in any of his appearances and was left warming the bench when his side lost 2-1 on his return to Old Trafford.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "In the Champions League, boss Enzo Maresca could have handed Garnacho an ideal chance to get off the mark for the Blues but opted against it. Despite Chelsea leading a 10-man Ajax 4-1 at half time, Maresca chose to bring on Tyrique George and Reggie Walsh, as well as Andrey Santos, Trevoh Chalobah and Josh Acheampong, leaving Garnacho as an unused substitute.",
      "While there have been glimpses of promise from him, he is yet to truly shine. Looking back at his performances for the UEFA Conference League winners, it's easy to recall Parker's remarks from June.",
      "The former United defender said at the time: \"I also think it would be a bad decision for both him and Chelsea if he went there.",
      "\"He needs a bit of fresh air. He needs a change of environment, and I think he could benefit from a move to another country.\"",
      "The ex-United star added: \"He doesn't have the right attitude and he doesn't want to put in enough work. I don't think that ever will change.\"",
      "During Chelsea's 3-0 away triumph over Nottingham Forest in the Premier League, Garnacho was given a starting role on the left flank. As the west Londoners found themselves struggling against the home team, he was withdrawn and substituted by Jamie Gittens.",
      "Chelsea attacker Pedro Neto looked clearly annoyed with the South American's failure to get onto the end of multiple crosses to the far post. Former England international Peter Crouch spotted this and commended Maresca's choice to substitute the ex-United star.",
      "He said: \"Chelsea were a bit sloppy. Credit to Enzo for making those changes. I know Neto was really frustrated with him [Garnacho]. He was crossing the ball and not getting on the other side. Neto was really frustrated with him.\"",
      "Garnacho will be hoping to feature in his team's home fixture against Sunderland on Saturday. The Blues currently sit in fifth place, but trail current league leaders Arsenal by just five points.",

They are fun to watch, really good with build-up, really strong with transitions in every aspect of the game and are doing well with set-pieces.\"",

      "\"He's feeling well and the knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or week, but he's near to starting the training with the team. Then it depends whether he wins a place or not. That will depend on him, but he is closer to returning to [full] training. \"",
      "United will not take any risks with Martinez, but he could be available for selection again just before the November international break.

Then we have a good spirit and sometimes when you have a good spirit, you have a bit of luck that you need to win games.",
      "It is a little different what I was expecting, everything you read about a player is sometimes not that. You can understand the frustrations he feels because he wants to help a lot the teammates. Sometimes it is not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here. He wants the responsibility all the time. He suffers a lot when we lose, every time we don't win a game, you can feel it - he takes it personally - as he should be as the captain. He is a great leader, great footballer and let's see if he reaches that mark tomorrow.",
      "We use the good spirit of winning games we know that was a good weekend for us but our focus is on the next game. That is in the past and we need to understand that football changes a lot, especially this kind of club so we are not thinking about the last game, we are thinking about this game and it is going to be really hard to win.",
      "It is going to be a very difficult game. Brighton are really fun to watch they are really good on build-up, they are really strong on transistions in every aspect of the game. They are doing well at set pieces this season so they are a team who are really complete. We need to be really smart and to face that game with a real focus on everything that we do because they are a very strong team. You can see with how they play the game. They are really intense, the quality is there. They believe a lot on what they are doing even under pressure so I am a huge fan of him [Hurzeler].",
      "Squad is fine we have some doubts some issues during the week with Maguire and Mount. Knocks but nothing serious we shall see tomorrow. Licha is out but the rest are ready for the game.",
      "Amorim has arrived for his press conference. Updates to follow...",
      "Amorim is speaking to the assembled media at Carrington as we speak. We shall be bringing you all the updates when the embargo drops at 1.30pm.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest here...",
      "After their defeat to United last weekend, Arne Slot seemed to be less than complimentary about the system that Amorim implemented at Old Trafford. Now, the Liverpool boss has insisted that what he said was meant to be a compliment.",
      "Before their clash with Brentford, Slot said:",
      "It was meant to be a compliment to the opposing manager finding a way to play against us but I don't think it has come across like that...",
      "Saturday will mark a big afternoon for Brighton's Carlos Baleba who remains on United's shortlist to improve their midfield in the future. Speaking ahead of the midfielder's trip to Old Trafford this weekend, Fabian Hurzeler has called on Baleba to drown out the noise surrounding his future.",
      "It's the next step for him as a person to overcome the rumours and the noise. He needs to focus on what he can control because he can't influence the rumours and the noise, only the things he does on the pitch.",
      "We will be bringing you all the updates from Amorim's press conference right here so do not go anywhere! The Portuguese head coach is set to address the media at 1.15pm with his comments embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "At which point, we shall provide you with everything that the United head coach had to say.",
      "United's captain is set for a special afternoon and evening at Old Trafford tomorrow when he is expected to make his 300th appearance for the club. In his previous 299 games for the club, Fernandes has managed 100 goals and 87 assists.",
      "Our United writer Steven Railston has spoken to him this morning and you'll be able to see what he had to say at 5pm on the MEN Sport website.",
      "We are just an hour and a half away from Amorim speaking to the media this afternoon. Here is what we can expect to be spoken about today.",
      "United's interest in Baleba didn't last long in the summer transfer window. Brighton valued Baleba at around £100million, which made it tricky for United to finance a deal, and they outlined that they were \"very confident\" he would remain at the Amex Stadium.",
      "The Seagulls had planned to have Baleba for at least another season. United sources eventually said the midfield was not a priority due to already having squad options viewed as strong and versatile.",
      "Baleba was considered at one stage in the summer transfer window, though, and United may have made an offer for the 21-year-old if they hadn't already spent a hefty sum.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "United's exciting 15-year-old JJ Gabriel trained with the first team at Carrington on Thursday. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "Hurzeler was asked in his press conference about United's inconsistencies under Amorim but Hurzeler was keen only to praise the Portuguese head coach.",
      "It's not my job to comment on that but the only thing I can say is that I am really looking forward to competing against one of the best managers. I think he is one of the best, of course he's not in an easy phase with Manchester but he's proved in the past how good he can be. Why can't they win three games in a row? I don't know because I'm not there.",
      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking to the media this morning and had this to say on United:",
      "I think they are playing more direct and more vertical style so more long balls trying to target [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko, trying to win the second balls and continue on the wing. Trying to attack the box with deep runs and of course they have a lot of individual qualities. They can change the game with one action. No matter who it is. They are a danger for us and we have to be staying alive for 90 minutes because they can score from every phase.",
      "Every United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "On Thursday, MEN Sport reported that Zirkzee was aiming to leave United in the January transfer window. It is understood that the Dutchman is keen to gain more minutes to revitalise his career.",
      "The World Cup next summer is likely to be a driving factor for the centre-forward who has not been called up for the Netherlands since November 2024. While he wants to remain in the Premier League, he would also be open to a move to another European club.",
      "West Ham are thought to be leading the way at the moment.",
      "Read more >>>",
      "United are looking strong at present ahead of the clash with Brighton.",
      "Mazraoui was a doubt heading into the Liverpool game but he managed to be fit enough to make the bench. Martinez is expected to be the only player missing from the squad again.",
      "However, he is closing in on a return in November.",
      "Amorim will address the media this afternoon at 1.15pm. However, what he says will be embargoed until 1.30pm.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of Amorim's pre-Brighton press conference.",
      "We will bring you everything he has to say this afternoon ahead of the Brighton clash, including team news and injury updates as United look to make it three wins in a row after last Sunday's excellent 2-1 win over Liverpool.",

      "“In the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Marcus Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco. Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and completed the transfer on a deal with a €30million buy option clause, but now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions – between goals and assists – and doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“He can play as a striker, he can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona, and, once again, as I have been telling you for weeks, the feeling internally at Barca is that Rashford really perfectly fits the structure they have on the tactical point of view with Barcelona.",
      "“They are all very happy with all the relationship Rashford has with his team-mates as well. The reputation of Rashford is something that has to be clarified. He is really popular in the dressing room at Barcelona.",
      "“Look at the image after the game of Fermin Lopez scores an attack against Olympiacos, Marcus Rashford, who scored two goals, took the ball and went to Fermin Lopez, telling him, okay, take the ball, because, also, this kind of behaviour is something really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "\"The performance is okay, of course, goals, assists, Rashford is doing very well, very versatile player upfront who can play in several positions, but also important to say, the behaviour, the attitude of Marcus Rashford is really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "“So, let me say, from what I understand, the feeling internally at Barcelona – internal means board, management, technical staff, the manager and those who work closely with Hansi Flick – is that if Marcus Rashford will continue like this in every single point of view – delivering performances and perfect attitude – he will have very good chances to continue at the club beyond this season.”"

      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.\"",
      "When asked specifically if the interest from United had affected the midfielder, the Brighton boss added: \"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Baleba must improve and put an underwhelming start to the campaign behind him if he wants to earn a move to Old Trafford, where he will make an appearance on Saturday evening.",
      "It wouldn't be a surprise to see Baleba deliver his best performance of the season in Manchester this weekend, given Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox will be present in the directors' box.",
      "Baleba will probably see the game as a transfer audition. However, to be worth £100m, Baleba must deliver consistently strong performances each week, not just when the time feels right to perform.",
      "Brighton have a reputation for exporting players for huge fees and are unlikely to budge on their valuation next summer, so it's down to Baleba to perform like a player worth that fee.",
      "There are currently doubts about whether he is worth such an outlay.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee's time at Manchester United looks to be in its closing stages as we begin to creep further towards the January transfer window opening.",
      "MEN Sport reported on Thursday that Zirkzee is looking to leave United sooner rather than later, with the winter market seen as his time to request a departure. Struggling West Ham are thought to be keen on the Dutchman, who is searching for more minutes ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "It is believed that Zirkzee is keen to leave United to reignite his stuttering career and few can blame him. The 24-year-old has yet to start a match this season for the Reds.",
      "He played nearly an hour in the victory over Burnley but his introduction came after Matheus Cunha picked up an injury in the first-half. Since then, he has played just 15 minutes across five Premier League matches.",
      "The brutal reality for Zirkzee is that he has dropped down the pecking order at a rapid rate. Ruben Amorim has two main tactics at present when it comes to his attack.",
      "The first is the traditional triangle that he likes to utilise at the top of the pitch. Benjamin Sesko leads that three with two of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount behind him.",
      "The other option is to play the striker-less system which worked expertly against Liverpool at Anfield. This sees Mbeumo and Mount partnering Cunha, who plays a free role up top. Few expected Sesko not to start on Sunday having bagged two goals in two games - with even Arne Slot caught out by the move - but it worked a treat.",
      "Cunha was sensational in that role on Sunday. Sadly for Zirkzee, he just does not fit in that picture.",
      "Zirkzee is now third-choice behind a striker-less system and that sums up how desperate the situation has become for him at the club.",
      "There is no longer any justification for keeping Zirkzee beyond January and while he will always deserve credit for how he bounced back last season, now is the right time to move on.",

      "\"I think they are playing more direct and more vertical style so more long balls trying to target [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko, trying to win the second balls and continue on the wing,\" Hurzeler added. \"Trying to attack the box with deep runs and of course they have a lot of individual qualities.",
      "\"They can change the game with one action - no matter who it is. They are a danger for us and we have to be staying alive for 90 minutes because they can score from every phase.\"",
      "The Reds are continuing to monitor Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. Baleba's form has been indifferent this campaign but Hurzeler insists he will return to his best.",
      "\"I think it's very important to understand that we saw some really good actions from Baleba against Newcastle and I'm pleased to hear this,\" he added. \"It's always the most important how a player feels, that he feels like he's getting back to his own.",
      "\"Now it's about all the behaviours that he showed against Newcastle and making them into habits, if you do it consistently, daily business, every training showing these behaviours and actions then you get habits.

      "Wayne Rooney found himself in a lighthearted scuffle with Joe Calzaghe at Paul Stretford's wedding.",
      "As the Old Trafford hero marks his 40th birthday, he joined Stretford, Tony Bellew and the BBC on the Wayne Rooney Show to share some of his most cherished recollections.",
      "Following discussions about his stint under David Moyes at Everton and his initial encounter with boxing great Bellew, the chat quickly shifted to a memorable exchange Rooney once had with another celebrated fighter.",
      "Stretford fondly remembered his big day, explaining: \"So I was looking after Joe at the time. So Joe came to the wedding, Wayne's there of course.",
      "\"And we've had a few drinks and he offers Joe Calzaghe out. I'm stood there talking to them both and he goes, 'Alright Joe.' 'Alright Wayne?' 'Could have you.'",
      "\"I'm looking and I'm thinking, 'You're joking me.' He's going, 'No, just calm down... I just want to do a bit of shadow boxing with him.' So we go out and we go onto the green outside where we were - middle of my wedding.",
      "\"So we go out and Joe's going, 'Don't worry, it's nothing.' So he goes out, first thing, so Joe's just sort of stood there. He's [Wayne's] in - to the ribs.\"",
      "With a laugh and a touch of irony, Rooney then said: \"I seen him, he was a bit vulnerable, he'd had a few drinks. Might give him his first defeat,\" referring to Calzaghe's remarkable unblemished boxing record, which stretched from 1993 to 2008.",
      "When Stretford expressed shared concerns that Calzaghe might retaliate, Bellew responded: \"As a fighter, they never react to stuff like that. But he's only just challenged the greatest fighter Britain's ever produced. Fantastic.\"",
      "Stretford then added: \"But that's Wayne, eh?\" Bellew then said: \"It is. He's lively and yeah, he's even more lively if he's had a pint - as most men are, to be honest, to be fair.",
      "\"We're all the same, we're all children who have never really grown up. And Wazza's one of the biggest children I've ever met.\"",
      "Despite facing off against boxing greats such as Roy Jones Jr, Chris Eubank and Byron Mitchell during his illustrious career, Calzaghe hung up his gloves in 2009 with an unbeaten record of 46-0, including 32 knockouts.",
      "He will also go down in history as the longest-reigning super-middleweight champion, with 21 successful defences of his title over nine years.",
      "He clinched The Ring's light-heavyweight title following a split-decision victory over Bernard Hopkins in 2008, defending it later that year against Jones Jr.",
      "Meanwhile, Rooney has clarified that he has no plans to step into the boxing ring for a professional bout anytime soon, as per the Mirror.",
      "When asked if he's ever been tempted, he replied: \"No, you get asked to go and do Misfits and all that. You look at Jake Paul and what he's done, he's a good boxer. KSI does well and whatever, but no. It's a bit of fun and mess around.\"",

      "It was a brave decision from Ruben Amorim to bench Benjamin Sesko against Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Sesko had scored twice in his last two matches for Manchester United, but Amorim decided to revert to the striker-less front three he picked for the first three games of the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo looked threatening in those matches, but none of the three scored when all on the pitch together (Mbeumo only scored against Burnley once Mount was substituted).",
      "Although there was the potential for United to be blunt at Anfield, Mbeumo scored within two minutes at the Kop, finishing brilliantly following a perfectly-weighted pass from Amad.",
      "The decision to play with a striker-less front three worked a treat. Mbeumo, Cunha and Mount were excellent and Amorim now has a tough selection decision for Brighton's visit to Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Should Amorim persist with the striker-less attack that delivered at Anfield? United had one of the worst attacks in the league last season and it must be refreshing for Amorim to have a selection dilemma.",
      "It's a welcome headache for Amorim. The 40-year-old has strong attacking options at his disposal and can tweak the team accordingly to adapt to the opposition this season.",
      "The attacking pieces have fallen into place for Amorim and he will be aware of the importance of getting his team selection right against Brighton when considering what is at stake.",
      "The Liverpool victory was outstanding, but it must serve as a springboard for further success, so the visit of Brighton is arguably just as important as last weekend's visit to Anfield.",
      "United have a huge opportunity to win three games in a row and could possibly enter the November international break in the Champions League places if they build on their result against Liverpool.",
      "There would be logic in rewarding Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo for their performances in Merseyside by starting them against Brighton, as managers can be reluctant to change a winning team. There would also be logic in recalling Sesko to the starting XI, given his form before the Anfield visit.",
      "It will be a difficult decision for Amorim to make ahead of this weekend, but he prepared for the new season with a frontman in his plans and perhaps the scales will tip in Sesko's favour.",
      "Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo have developed an impressive understanding, however, there is a strong argument to play Sesko down the middle this weekend.",
      "Sesko arrived at Old Trafford in the summer window for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons. He could reach 20 goals this season if the attack clicks into gear, but Mount or Cunha are unlikely to reach that figure down the middle.",
      "Sesko has found his feet in Manchester over the last month, following his first goal against Brentford with a clever strike against Sunderland, and could be on the cusp of a purple patch if he's given starts.",
      "The ceiling for the striker-less front three is essentially lower than that of an attack including Sesko, which is why Amorim should recall the Slovenia international to the XI to face Brighton.",
      "In that scenario, who is moved to the bench is arguably an even bigger headache, but it has to be between Mount and Cunha, who would compete to start on the left side of the attack.",
      "Mbeumo has made an excellent start to the campaign and has the right side locked down, while it's difficult to choose between Mount and Cunha on the left after the last fortnight.",
      "Mount was superb against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. Cunha was recalled at Anfield and his clever game management was key in the closing stages of the contest.",
      "It's encouraging Amorim has tough decisions to make in a department that struggled last season.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",
      "Stephen Torpey sat alongside Jason Wilcox. The pair recently sat together at Old Trafford following Torpey's appointment as head of the academy (succeeding Nick Cox).",
      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",
      "It seemed Fletcher received his marching orders for dissent. Perhaps a strange decision, but his father might argue that there is a lesson to learn: you must control emotions on a football pitch.",
      "Barnsley smelt blood after the sending off and scored another two goals to claim a 5-2 victory. Wilcox had seen enough with seven minutes remaining, but Torpey remained in the stands to see the game out.",

The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Sporting Lisbon came from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, with former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood hooked at half-time.",
      "Greenwood came into the clash on a high after scoring four goals against Le Havre at the weekend. The 24-year-old has seven strikes and four assists so far this season, but he was sacrificed by Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi after the Ligue 1 side went down to 10 men in Portugal.",
      "De Zerbi's call to go safety first in the game has not gone down well with French media. Some outlets believe the Italian somewhat stifled his team's chances of winning by hauling Greenwood off and opting for a negative set-up, with De Zerbi seemingly still unconvinced when it comes to the defensive side of his game.",
      "Igor Paixao had put Marseille into the lead in the 14th minute. However, after Emerson was sent off in added time of the first half for diving to win a penalty having been set up by Greenwood, De Zerbi changed tact.",
      "His call to forfeit firepower in favour of solidity backfired as Sporting grew into the tie. Goals from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos condemned Marseille to defeat.",
      "Prior to Greenwood's exit at half-time, French outlet L’Equipe offered reserved praise for his performance. They wrote: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The outlet also awarded Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his first-half contribution. They said: “Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, subtly perplexed by Greenwood's hooking considering the player's general consistency, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has been critical of Greenwood's work rate ever since the ex-United player made the switch to France in July 2024. The Italian took another chance to remind Greenwood of his defensive responsibilities following the defeat to Sporting CP.",
      "“Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.”",
      "He told Canal+: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a center forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's strong words echo those he made in March, when he claimed he expected more from his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "Had Manchester United got their way, Casemiro would not still be playing at Old Trafford.",
      "United engaged several agents to try and sell Casemiro before the January transfer deadline, and they tried their luck again in the summer transfer window. Yet again they were unsuccessful.",
      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",
      "Seven weeks on from the closure of the summer transfer window and the narrative has definitely changed.",
      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",
      "If this is to be his final year at Old Trafford, United are learning how to get the best out of him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Every Manchester United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "The Belgian commanded his area in the hostile atmosphere and did superbly when he was called into action in the first half to prevent Alexander Isak equalising. In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

      "The atmosphere around Manchester United's Carrington training ground this week should be joyous after the club's exploits on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the game with Liverpool, you could see that Ruben Amorim was a whole lot lighter after the victory over Sunderland prior to the international break. However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

Anderson has been outstanding in the Premier League this season, leading the division for passes completed (569), progressive passes (71) and ball recoveries (64).

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",
      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",
      "“So I think now, as is quite widely reported, the interest in buying Manchester United comes predominantly from the UAE,” Jacobs said on the United Stand podcast.",
      "READ: Do Manchester United have the quality to offset ‘the new Ji-sung Park’?",
      "“The group haven’t made any offer to the Glazers. They haven’t even engaged in talks. So it can be simultaneously true that Manchester United are quite in the dark, and yet, there is a consortium out there that is building, and Turki Al-Sheikh tweet got everyone excited.",
      "“The word advanced was misleading. And although the consortium are maybe getting advanced in terms of where their money’s from and what it entails, it’s not advanced between a bidder, and Manchester United, in fact, quite the opposite.",
      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",
      "On the fabricated Beckham reports, he continued: “I have great respect for other journalists, so I’m not here to shout down anyone’s reporting.",
      "“You may recall when I first broke this on talks, but I said a series of ex-Manchester United legends have been approached.",
      "“But I have my doubts about David Beckham, because when Sheik Jassim approached David Beckham, and when Qatar 2022 approached David Beckham, he was willing to do stuff, but only after Qatar won, and only after, and he didn’t Sheikh Jassim won.",
      "“So I’d be surprised if David Beckham considered putting his name or his endorsement to any potential bidder for Manchester United until the point came where they were actually in the club, and then he may be open to some kind of involvement.",
      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",
      "Jacobs later pointed out that Ratcliffe “is not that fearful” about losing power as the takeover situation is “relatively quiet”.",
      "“I think the lines of communication are open enough that Ratcliffe, in agreeing to this sale, including the drag clause, is not that fearful that the Glazers are going to go in the next year or two, definitively in 100%,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“But let’s see if there’s a pathway to a strategic investor, or let’s see whether a consortium just blows the valuation of the Dragon claws out the water, in which case we may have to reconsider the position of all parties.",
      "“But right now, it’s relatively quiet on the takeover front, even though Turki Al-Sheikh got everybody very excited.”",
      "The Glazer family are “not really rushing in to sell” Man Utd following claims of a potential bid from a UAE-based consortium, according to reports.",
      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "A 38th player has been capped for England while at a foreign club despite having ‘just completely forgot about’ the national team after seven years out.",
      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",
      "Amorim is faced with the same chicken-and-egg scenario with regard to Mount, but without the goals and assists in the team besides to nullify his shocking lack of quantifiable contribution to points on the board for Manchester United.",
      "Paul Merson has called on Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim to drop Mason Mount for their next Premier League match against Brighton over the weekend.",

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",

      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "We typically air the views of former Red Devils full-back Paul Parker because their bizarre, controversial nature offers at worst the opportunity for a smile or a chuckle of a weekday.",
      "Those that are too bonkers for publication we typically ignore and brush off as the witterings of someone who might ordinarily scrawl their opinions on a toilet cubicle door.",
      "But we couldn’t help but be provoked by his latest views on Rashford, whom he’s never been shy in giving his two pennies’ worth on.",
      "“He let his team-mates down. He was lazy, he didn’t do anything. He’s got a lot to prove if he comes back to England. How many players in the UK would trust him if he played for their team? We know it, the answer is no-one. They would never say it, but they would be feeling it inside. It was life and death when I played, and that should have been inbuilt in him, but it isn’t.”",
      "Rashford can’t win. Either he doesn’t do well for Barcelona to prove he was never all that anyway. Or he does do well and that apparently shows just how “lazy” he must have been for United. And what about this assertion that “no-one would trust him”.",
      "That certainly didn’t seem to be the case at Aston Villa in the second half of last season, or indeed for England now. We would actually suggest that the Rashford currently slamming in goals and notching assists for Barcelona is the sort of of guy most “players in the UK” would turn to in order to get them out of a bind.",
      "As is the case with Roy Keane, Gary Neville and other former Manchester United players, Parker is struggling to come to terms with his former club being the problem, rather than Rashford and the many other players who have moved on and are thriving elsewhere. Not that he is actually thriving…",
      "“He has done alright, but I don’t think he is in Barcelona’s ideal starting 11. Will he start in a Champions League final with Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski? I think the answer is no. He doesn’t start. Everything about Marcus Rashford seems to be about politics, to be honest.”",
      "Using the guys who came second and fifth in the Ballon d’Or and arguably the greatest goalscorer of his generation as the yardstick to show Rashford isn’t actually doing that well shows just how few straws Parker has to grasp in that particular argument. And what’s that “politics” bit about? Still annoyed about feeding starving children? He’s got four goals and two assists in three Champions League games by ‘focusing on his football’.",
      "“Rashford put himself in a bad position where he didn’t know what to do. If you can’t give everything for your boyhood club and you are willing to let down the rest of the team, then that says a lot about you. If you can’t do it at the club you have been at since you were a kid, even saying you support that team and love the city where you have been brought up. If you can’t deliver for them and let your teammates down on numerous occasions, then you are in a very bad position.”",
      "It’s a “bad position” which now sees him playing and enjoying his football at one of the most famous and best clubs in Europe. He’s probably alright.",
      "“Then he went to Aston Villa and the media claimed he did well, but did he do better than Ollie Watkins? No. Did he do any better than Jacob Ramsey? No. But he was sold that way because the narrative was to put pressure on Man Utd.”",
      "We don’t think comparing Rashford with other very good footballers is making quite the point that Parker is aiming at, and Unai Emery often selected him ahead of Watkins. In both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, for example.",
      "Here’s to Rashford rattling in a hat-trick for Barcelona in his first El Classico on Sunday and Parker again being asked for his thoughts on his dramatic resurgence. He’ll find some new stick to beat him with, and if not, his brilliance for his new club will only strengthen his claim that Rashford was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "Marcus Rashford has sent a message to Man Utd that he wants to stay at Barcelona once his loan spell comes to an end in the summer.",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford scored his second Champions League brace of the season against Olympiacos. The Man Utd loanee is loving life at Barcelona.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only."

      "Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’ and could become a transfer target for West Ham in January, according to reports.",
      "Zirkzee joined Man Utd from Bologna for around £37million in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "Despite joining with huge potential after costing more than his £34m release clause, the Netherlands international has struggled to adapt to Premier League football.",
      "He played 49 times across all competitions for the Red Devils in 2024/25, registering seven goals and three assists.",
      "One of Zirkzee’s biggest problems is where he fits on the pitch. Nobody seems to know what his best position is, and there appears to be no place for him in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "There was potential for Zirkzee to thrive as one of Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, but so far this season, he’s only made four appearances and is yet to start a match.",
      "Amorim clearly doesn’t rate him, with new signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko comfortably ahead in the attacking pecking order.",
      "Mason Mount has also been preferred in attack this season and started away to Liverpool on Sunday, while Zirkzee was an unused substitute for the fifth time in the Premier League this campaign.",
      "Considering that Zirkzee has been in every matchday squad this season, Amorim might be reluctant to lose the attacking depth he provides, but you can’t blame the player if he wants to leave the club.",
      "The 24-year-old has been linked with a return to Italy pretty much ever since he joined Man Utd, and that is still an option for him.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham could make Zirkzee a target in January as new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo wants at least three new signings when the transfer window reopens, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Indeed, the report states that Nuno is demanding a new striker be signed in the winter window, with Zirkzee a ‘potential option’.",
      "It’s claimed that Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’, with AS Roma one of several Serie A clubs interested in the ex-Bologna striker.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has made it clear to the West Ham hierarchy that he needs at least three new signings in January, including a striker.",
      "One potential option is Manchester United outcast Joshua Zirkzee, who is desperate to leave Old Trafford.",
      "West Ham would face competition for Zirkzee from clubs in Italy, including Roma, who would consider terminating misfiring Evan Ferguson’s loan from Brighton to bring in a replacement.",
      "Nuno would prefer a target-man in the Chris Wood and Raul Jimenez ilk.",
      "You really can’t blame Zirkzee if he is ‘desperate to leave’ the Red Devils.",
      "He’s only 24 and has proved at Bologna that he can be a top player. Furthermore, it’s a World Cup year and he needs to be playing if Ronald Koeman is to consider selecting him.",
      "A return to Italy should do the trick for Zirkzee, who is yet to prove he can fulfill his potential playing in England.",
      "From what he has shown so far, Zirkzee doesn’t look up to the pace of the Premier League and his game is not well-suited to the competition.",
      "Serie A is perfect for him and if there’s any chance of him making the Netherlands’ World Cup squad, he should return to Italy in January.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has agreed to let Joshua Zirkzee leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "This XI, featuring the past, present and future of Arsenal highlights once more the Gunners’ strength in depth…",
      "The agent of Joshua Zirkzee has been criticised for taking his client to Man Utd after the Premier League club has “become a cesspool”.",
      "Man Utd are willing to accept a deal in the region of £30m for Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "A Serie A giant chief has reportedly drawn up an ‘intriguing idea’ to land a Manchester United attacker who is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ at the moment.",

      "After calling events at Anfield last weekend to a tee, The Radar column returns with a look at Tottenham's mismatched midfield pairing of Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur and the numbers underlining the super-powers of Man Utd's Bruno Fernandes",
      "Friday 24 October 2025 10:34, UK",
      "",
      "🤔 Tottenham's midfield issue analysed📊 Fernandes' unrivalled creativity🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Wednesday's game against Monaco was just the latest in which the balance has looked off in the centre of Frank's team. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Palhinha and Bentancur are too similar, both players' strengths lying out of possession.",
      "Spurs are struggling to progress the ball through midfield. Amazingly, the pair only directed seven of a combined 58 passes forward against Monaco. They only found striker Richarlison three times. Substitute Randal Kolo Muani was not found once.",
      "The issue was clear in Spurs' defeat to Aston Villa too, with Palhinha and Bentancur sending only 15 of their 79 passes forward and only finding Mathys Tel once. Even in the win over Leeds, in which Tel scored, he was only fed twice by Palhinha and Bentancur.",
      "Tel's goal proved crucial at Elland Road but he was substituted in the second half of the game having only touched the ball 13 times.",
      "Spurs profile similarly to Burnley, West Ham and Everton for forward passes and defenders bypassed from central midfield this season, at the opposite end of the scale to the Premier League's top sides.",
      "Frank might argue that pairing Palhinha and Bentancur together is a means of adding defensive solidity. But that is a hard case to make after Wednesday's game. Monaco cut through Spurs easily. They had enough chances to win it twice over.",
      "Their record with and without them is revealing.",
      "Spurs have only won three out of nine games with both players starting this season, and one of them was against League One Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup. The side's record is far better in their other games, with three wins and a draw from four.",
      "In fairness, they are not the only ones being found wanting when it comes to servicing the side's forwards. Xavi Simons provided an assist against West Ham from a corner on his debut following his arrival from PSV Eindhoven but has struggled since.",
      "Across two starts in the No 10 role against Leeds and Aston Villa, he did not manage to complete a single pass to Tottenham's strikers.",
      "The disconnect running through the heart of the team can be seen in their passing network, which highlights the lack of combinations between their midfield and attack this season.",
      "So what are the alternatives? With Simons still finding his feet, Frank is unfortunate to be without the injured James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, key players who ranked first and third respectively among Spurs players for progressive passes last season.",
      "Frank's pool of midfielders without them is a shallow one. He has Lucas Bergvall and also mentioned Archie Gray as an option after using him at left-back against Monaco. Pape Matar Sarr might be his best bet to bring some much-needed drive having impressed with a goal and two assists earlier in the campaign.",
      "In the long-term, Spurs will probably need to use future transfer windows to redress the balance between ball-winners and ball-players at the base of their midfield. But in the meantime, a change to the Palhinha and Bentancur axis looks necessary.",
      "He reaches the milestone with an outstanding body of work behind him. His total of 100 goals in 299 games puts him 26 clear of any current or former team-mate in the same timeframe. His total of 84 assists is more than double anyone else's.",
      "Fernandes has had to endure periods of heavy criticism during his time in the Premier League. His status as captain remains the subject of some debate. But few players can claim to have been more consistent when it comes to the stuff that really matters.",
      "The 31-year-old is out on his own among Premier League players for chances created since his debut in 2020, his total of 560 roughly 30 per cent higher than the next player on the list in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "He also comes out on top for expected assists, which highlights the quality of the opportunities created as well as the volume.",
      "Fernandes has been moved further back by Amorim this season, into his midfield two. But he continues to deliver unmatched creativity.",
      "The sensational first-time cross to set up Harry Maguire's winning goal against Liverpool at Anfield was one of 22 chances created by him this season. No other player has created more than 17.",
      "Where Manchester United would be without him hardly bears thinking about after the lows of last season. But his robustness is another super-power. Fernandes has featured in 203 of a possible 212 Premier League games since his arrival, starting 199.",
      "He is always there. And he almost always delivers.",
      "Savinho's Manchester City future appeared uncertain following interest from Spurs in the summer but he signed a new contract earlier this month and looks to be getting back to his best having provided assists in back-to-back games against Everton and Villarreal. Erling Haaland will aim to make the most of his service against Aston Villa.",

      "Thursday 23 October 2025 14:43, UK",
      "Manchester United's win at Anfield was huge for this team, make no mistake about it.",
      "To finally get back-to-back wins for the first time, not just under Ruben Amorim, but since May 2024, is finally a topic we do not have to talk about anymore.",
      "Also, to be the first United side and manager to win at Anfield for the first time since 2016 is another impressive feat.",
      "This is in addition to the 2-0 win against Sunderland before the latest international break, which was seen as a huge challenge for a United side that had just come off a disappointing defeat to Brentford one week before. Again, well-handled by United.",
      "They are overdue a bit of credit after what had all the potential to be a disastrous few weeks, the type of few weeks that could raise even further questions about a manager's future.",
      "Having spoken to a few of the players after the Liverpool game, including Diogo Dalot and Senne Lammens, I get the feeling the players sense this could be the start of real momentum under Amorim.",
      "However, with United hosting Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend it will be their toughest test this season and truly a measure of how this team has developed under Amorim in the last 12 months.",
      "Sometimes you come across strange statistics when two teams face each other. From memory, it was pretty easy to remember Brighton had beaten United in both of their meetings last season.",
      "However it is more shocking to learn that Brighton have beaten them in six of their last seven meetings. No team has beaten the Red Devils on more occasions since 2022 than Brighton.",
      "For Amorim's only game in charge against Brighton, United were dismantled last season by long balls as well as their own errors - including one by Andre Onana, who is now out on loan in Turkey.",
      "With United's new keeper Lammens continuing his impressive start to life at Old Trafford, the side have improved from last season in terms of showing defiant defensive performances when they have needed to against the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Burnley.",
      "However, they will have to show they can contain Brighton's imposing and incisive style of play - a type of test they have yet had at Old Trafford bar the opening day against Arsenal.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba starred (while also giving away a penalty) in last season's win at Old Trafford and it will undoubtedly be an interesting subplot as Baleba's form has taken time to warm up amid interest shown in him by United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Since Amorim's arrival, United have won just 11 games in the Premier League. When you dissect those 11 wins, four have come against the 'bigger' sides in the league.",
      "Then you look at the other seven, five are against promoted sides, one against a relegation-threatened Everton last season and a win away to Fulham which, after a decent sample size, feels like a bit of an outlier.",
      "United have shown glimpses of what they are capable of but, other than Tottenham Hotspur in a few weeks, until they face Aston Villa on December 21, all of their upcoming fixtures would be classed as against mid-table sides.",
      "These are the games United have struggled in over the last 12 months, the games they have failed to consistently make an impact, a performance or gather consistency.",
      "This is going to be a pivotal time in the season for Amorim's United. The Portuguese manager as well as his players have spoken repeatedly about building momentum and wanting to put last season's troubles behind them; this is their first opportunity to do so.",
      "There will be interesting selection dilemmas for Amorim ahead of their match against Brighton.",
      "When you look at their two previous wins, he has gone with two slightly different teams - the first difference being who leads the line as the No 9. Matheus Cunha displayed an accomplished performance against Liverpool, but then Benjamin Sesko also picked up his first goal at Old Trafford against Sunderland in the previous game.",
      "Other dilemmas will be whether Amorim continues with the combination of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo on the right - their chemistry a huge positive of the season so far - and will Harry Maguire continue at the back after his Anfield heroics? Or could Leny Yoro be recalled with Brighton's threat of pace in behind?",
      "Interesting selections for Amorim to ponder but he has got all of his tactical and in-game situations right in the last two games, so this does not seem just a huge opportunity for his side but also for the manager himself who has made no secret of just how tough the job leading this United side has been over the last 12 months.",
      "If United are able to string back-to-back wins against two opponents they have had poor results against in recent years it would do wonders for this team's confidence but also perhaps it would gain the trust and respect of not just the fans at Old Trafford but of opponents, pundits and the media alike as well.",

      "Thursday 23 October 2025 23:48, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and thinks West Ham are in for more misery at Leeds.",
      "West Ham are now 10/11 with Sky Bet to be relegated, and frankly, that might still be on the generous side.",
      "What we're watching isn't a blip or a bad run, it's the inevitable product of years of poor recruitment and muddled thinking. Across 2025, if you take out the relegated teams, the Hammers have taken the fewest points of any Premier League team (24) and conceded the most goals (45).",
      "The modern Premier League is defined by energy, athleticism and the ability to win duels all over the pitch.",
      "West Ham are not fit for purpose in that regard.",
      "What was once a robust and organised unit under David Moyes has eroded into a plodding, predictable outfit who are easily bullied. There's no clear identity to this squad now - one which is too slow to play on the counter and too fragile to play on the front foot.",
      "And in a league where even the promoted teams, like Leeds, are stacked with pace, athleticism and duel-winners, it stinks of a relegation season now for the Hammers.",
      "The Brentford performance sounded those alarm bells loud and clear. This is a football club heading one way - and that's down. Anyone looking to build a bet for this one should put a Leeds win at 5/6 with Sky Bet as the cornerstone.",
      "Dan Ballard to have a shot at 5/6 with Sky Bet jumps off the page at the prices on offer.",
      "The centre-back isn't just a threat from set pieces, he's an aerial menace, a man who dominates the skies like a 747 cutting through cloud.",
      "Ballard's presence from dead-ball situations is becoming one of the most potent set-piece weapons in the league. Sunderland know it, as do their opposition, but stopping him is another matter entirely. He attacks the ball with that blend of timing, aggression and pure intent. If you squint, it could be Harry Maguire. The two are very alike.",
      "They both play like their forehead contains a magnet to the ball. It's why Ballard's shots data is so appealing when it comes to betting. In just 293 minutes of action this season, he's had eight shots - which equates to 2.32 per 90.",
      "When this plane takes off, you want to be on board.",
      "Malick Thiaw is settling in nicely at Newcastle and is popping up as a genuine threat from set pieces. At 6ft 4in, he's built like a brick, erm, lighthouse and attacks the ball with great authority - something which is key to finding value in the prop markets on centre-backs. He goes up with the intention of scoring a goal as shown by his haul of six shots in his last five appearances.",
      "Fulham's set-piece defending has been a worry for a while. Since the start of last season they are averaging 0.35 worth of expected goals conceded from set pieces per 90 - of ever-present Premier League sides only Manchester United and West Ham are shipping more .",
      "And the absence of Joachim Andersen for Fulham, their dominant aerial presence and organiser at the back, leaves a glaring void. Thiaw can take advantage and looks a slice of value at 4/1 with Sky Bet to have a shot on target.",
      "Momentum is everything in betting and sport. Spot the players in form before the markets fully wake up and you're laughing.",
      "Last week, we were on the right lines with Amad Diallo to play a part in a Manchester United goal against Liverpool, and he delivered. He's linking up beautifully down the right with Bryan Mbeumo, forming a partnership that's quietly starting to purr.",
      "Tactically, this match-up looks tailor-made for those two again. Brighton's full-backs push on aggressively, leaving acres of grass behind them which is perfect territory for pace and precision on the counter.",
      "It's easy to picture a scenario of Mbeumo spinning infield, Amad overlapping and the net rippling for a second week in a row. It's 3/1 with Sky Bet for both Amad and Mbeumo to score or assist.",
      "All the scrutiny on Alexander Isak, Mohamed Salah and Florian Wirtz at Liverpool has taken the limelight away from Cody Gakpo, who is quietly stealing the show this season in the Liverpool attack. He's the first name on the teamsheet.",
      "In a Liverpool front line full of egos and expectation, he's quietly doing what every forward should: scoring goals, consistently. He's bagged three in his last three and at 2/1 with Sky Bet to score against Brentford, it's clear the market hasn't noticed the Gakpo hot streak.",
      "The Bees do struggle with fluid, interchanging movement from opposition strikers, and their tendency to defend the width of the box opens up the perfect pockets for Gakpo to exploit - like he did in this fixture last season where he somehow failed to score despite a bulky expected goals figure of 0.84 from three shots.",
      "While everyone's watching and critiquing the star attacking options, the smart money should be on the in-form one.",
      "There's a betting angle emerging with Arsenal regarding their second halves producing more goals than the first. Mikel Arteta's side are the masters of control and that is seen through this trend. They strangle games early, suffocate space and rarely give the opposition a sniff in the first half.",
      "But once the patterns are set and perhaps fatigue creeps in with decision-making from the opposition in the second half, the tempo changes and that's where the goals tend to come. There have been just eight first-half goals scored in Arsenal's last 10 matches across all competitions, but 16 after the break.",
      "It's 11/10 with Sky Bet for more goals to be scored in the second half than the first.",
      "There's a new ruthlessness about Manchester City, not just with the ball, but without it.",
      "The headlines might still go to the monster that is Erling Haaland, but equally as important is their defensive solidity. Led by the colossus Ruben Dias and the commanding presence of Gianluigi Donnarumma, this is a side that has rediscovered the art of control and clean sheets. The Italian goalkeeper has conceded just four goals in eight games.",
      "And that makes City to win to nil at 5/2 with Sky Bet a bet that demands attention.",
      "The market still gives Villa plenty of respect at home - and understandably so, given their record of losing just one of their last 22 Premier League home games. However, dig a little deeper and Villa's expected goals numbers in the Premier League are still underwhelming at just 0.86 per 90 - only four teams have a lower average.",
      "City are taken to see them off.",
      "Every so often, a market quietly drifts away from reality and that's exactly what's happened with Bournemouth's goal lines. While everyone associates Andoni Iraola's side with chaos and attacking flair, the raw numbers paint a far duller picture, especially at home.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League home games, matches at the Vitality have averaged just 1.92 goals per game. Enter the perfect storm for a low-scoring encounter, then, as in come Nottingham Forest under Sean Dyche.",
      "You know what you're getting with Dyche, a compact shape, an emphasis on organisation and a gameplan built around defensive resilience. His teams don't do chaos. It's all about containment, especially away from home.",
      "At 10/11 with Sky Bet, the price for under 2.5 goals is a runner.",
      "Ah, the six-pointer. Two words that make managers twitch and fans panic.",
      "These are the fixtures that decide seasons. For Wolves it is simply a massive match.",
      "They remain the only team without a win in the top four divisions this season and a failure to show the required intent against Burnley could just tip an already frustrated home crowd over the edge. Every so often in football, the biggest threat to a team's performance isn't the opposition, it's their own stadium. West Ham have proven it this season and it might just be the case for Wolves here.",
      "The hosts look a touch skinny at Evens with Sky Bet meaning Burnley on the double chance are the play at 4/5.",
      "Under Thomas Frank's watch, Spurs look more organised, compact and risk-averse. In 13 games, they are conceding just 0.8 goals per game. Frank clearly has focused on the structural basics: protecting the centre-backs, limiting transitions, ensuring the midfield-defensive link is sound.",
      "That side of the game is working.",
      "But football is not only about shutting the door - it's also about creating chances, scoring goals and giving something for the fans to shout about. Spurs aren't doing that - as shown by their lacklustre attacking showing in Monaco where they once again created low volume and low quality chances. Across their last nine games they are averaging just 9.67 shots per 90.",
      "So, we've got a team here in Spurs that don't concede goals or don't score many.",
      "Back the under 2.5 line at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",
