      "Manchester United's relationship with Ruben Amorim ended on a sour note, culminating in the now-former head coach's departure following the draw with Leeds. However, the Red Devils may still face some tension depending on their choice of replacement.",
      "Oliver Glasner is reportedly one of the early favourites to take over from Amorim permanently.",
      "Known for his outspoken nature throughout his managerial career, Glasner could potentially cause some caution within the Old Trafford hierarchy, especially when considering Amorim's previous frustrations about being treated as a 'coach' rather than a 'manager'.",
      "Back in November 2020, Glasner - who was then seen as a reserved figure - publicly criticised the management at his former club, Wolfsburg. Glasner took a swipe at their sporting director Jorg Schmadtke, who later played a role in Liverpool's signings of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "\"One of our targets was to bring in a player with pace and deep runs,\" Glasner said. \"We didn't manage to do that, despite talking about it for months.\"",
      "Schmadtke retaliated in an interview, labelling Glasner's ideas 'unrealistic'. The duo's relationship eventually deteriorated and, despite leading Wolfsburg to the Champions League, Glasner left for Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Similarly, during his tenure at Crystal Palace, Glasner has not shied away from expressing his discontent. The FA Cup-winning manager has repeatedly voiced his frustration at the Eagles' lack of investment ahead of European competition.",
      "\"I would have wished for a little bit more backing, yes,\" Glasner said back in November. \"I think in January we just correct what we failed to do in the summer. By January, we have played 60/65 per cent of the season... Let's see.\"",
      "There were also reports last year that the Palace manager 'threatened' to leave the Eagles if they sold defender Marc Guehi on deadline day last summer. That's something which Glasner went on to deny.",
      "England star Guehi was on the brink of signing for Liverpool, before that deal was abruptly called off. Such actions might serve as a warning to United executives Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, but Amorim's comments could also be a cautionary note for Glasner.",
      "Amorim recently expressed frustration over his inability to implement his preferred formation, with Glasner also favouring a setup with three central defenders.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play our perfect 3-4-3, that we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" Amorim said. \"I'm starting to understand that's not going to happen. Maybe now I have to adapt.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson predicted that Darren Fletcher would become a manager years before the former Manchester United star retired from playing. And Fletcher, 41, has now been given the United job temporarily and will be on the touchline for Wednesday's clash with Burnley.",
      "It follows the sacking of Ruben Amorim which was announced on Monday morning, less than 24 hours after the Red Devils drew 1-1 away to Leeds. Fletcher previously served as an assistant to ex-United boss Erik ten Hag before being appointed as head coach of the club's under-18s side in July.",
      "But now the Scot will make the step up for at least one game, as the Old Trafford hierarchy deliberate over their next move. Ferguson, whether he's at Turf Moor or sat in his living room, will be watching proudly as Fletcher leads United for the first time.",
      "In an interview with West Bromwich Albion's media team in 2017, Ferguson explained how he got Fletcher working closely with youth coach Warren Joyce amid fears that the former midfielder wouldn't ever be able to return to the pitch, having been diagnosed with chronic bowel disease in 2011.",
      "\"I'm starting to think maybe he’s not going to make it,\" Ferguson recalled. \"I started preparing him along the lines that he could become a coach with us because that was, without question, my long-term view of it.",
      "\"They were losing 1-0 at Altrincham, so I went into the dressing room at half-time because I wasn't particularly pleased. Darren was doing the motivation, tactics, and Warren had given him that head to do that. It was fantastic.",
      "\"I'll always remember he says, 'If you're playing for Manchester United, there's an expectation, son, that you're not showing out there. If you can't do it in a reserve game you've absolutely no chance of playing for Alex Ferguson",
      "\"I'll always remember him saying that. He didn't see me and I was standing at the door. I should have given him a rise.\"",
      "Will Darren Fletcher be a success as interim manager? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "When asked whether he thought that Fletcher would go on to become a coach after he retired, which ended up being in 2020 following a spell with Stoke City, Ferguson replied: \"[It is an] absolute certainty.",
      "\"I think his long-term position will be as a coach. Maybe even management. He's got the presence, he's got the sacrifice. When you become a manager, Martin (interviewer), it's a sacrifice.",
      "\"You give up your family life, which I did. I scouted my own players, I went to games every week - midweek and everywhere. That's the kind of sacrifice and you need to have the type of wife who understands that.\"",

      "Manchester United's director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, reportedly informed the club's senior leadership that Ruben Amorim needed to make his system less predictable back in August. The Daily Mail claims that the former Chelsea technical director shared comments made by Fulham head coach Marco Silva and their player, Alex Iwobi, in their WhatsApp group about them knowing what United would do before their 1-1 draw.",
      "Silva said after the hosts came from a goal down to earn a point at Craven Cottage: \"We knew how they defend. And we know they like to squeeze from the back five.",
      "\"And if you don't give bodies for them to squeeze from the back five, you can create superiority in the middle. We know they play with two in the middle, we tried to overload with our three plus Alex (Iwobi); and it was as simple as that.\"",
      "Iwobi added: \"We knew that we would be able to get behind their two midfielders and that their centre-backs would want to jump. We exploited that today.\"",
      "Explanations about how Fulham exploited Amorim's system are claimed to have annoyed Vivell because of their brazen nature. United's players have also interacted with criticism of the Portuguese coach on other social media platforms.",
      "Patrick Dorgu 'liked' an Instagram post from one fan page which included the statement: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\" The caption on that post read: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together.\"",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it hasn't quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the moment. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position; he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the moment.\"",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his verdict on Ruben Amorim's departure from Manchester United, pinpointing which fixture proved to be the 'killer game' for the club's now-former manager. United confirmed on Monday that they had parted ways with Amorim following 14 months at the helm.",
      "Amorim's last match in charge of United was Sunday afternoon's 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. That outcome left United sitting sixth place in the Premier League standings, trailing fourth-placed Liverpool by three points near to the midway point.",
      "Recently, Amorim was questioned about the backing he had from United's hierarchy, prompting the 40-year-old Portuguese to offer a lengthy response regarding his position at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything,\" Amorim said, after United's draw with Leeds on Sunday. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people can't handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticism of everything, then we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "\"Look, if there was a meeting on Friday morning about the performance against Wolves between the sporting director and the manager - I would actually have been disappointed if there wasn't a meeting after the Wolves performance,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I think as a sporting director or owner of a football club, you should be entitled to go and speak to a manager when the team have played like they have against Wolves and, basically, Wolves have picked up a point at Old Trafford, only their third of the season.",
      "\"It seems to me that in the last week, Ruben Amorim has decided that he doesn't feel supported or he doesn't feel happy, he's called it out obviously in press conferences, decided to unleash at times and sort of be emotional and do what he does; I think he's always been honest, he's always done it with integrity, he's always speaking from the heart - we always enjoy his press conferences.",
      "\"But the reality of it is, when you turn on your bosses - it doesn't matter whether you're at a football club or you work in Morrisons - if you turn on your bosses, you're not going to keep your job very long.\"",
      "Neville added: \"Over the last five or six weeks, I've done probably every United game other than the Leeds and Crystal Palace games, and I've actually complimented United when I think they've performed well; against Bournemouth, when they drew 4-4, against Villa when they lost was a disappointing result, but I'd thought there was something in the performance.",
      "\"But some of the performances in the last month... if you look at the Everton game, losing to 10 men when to be fair Ruben Amorim kept three at the back against one and they were trying to chase a goal against 10-man Everton.",
      "\"The performance against West Ham - everyone is beating West Ham and Manchester United drew at home and to be fair West Ham could've got more out of the game. Everyone is beating Wolves, Manchester United drew against Wolves.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"So if you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way.",
      "\"I actually thought against Leeds, that was a decent performance, I thought it was a good point and he could have handled it differently after the game in the press conference but he didn't. The Wolves game to me seemed like the killer game, it was a bad one.\"",

      "Gary Neville warned the Manchester United that they can't fail with their next manager, declaring: \"These experiments have got to stop!\"",
      "Ruben Amorim was given his marching orders on Monday morning, Sunday's 1-1 stalemate with Leeds United at Elland Road proving his last game in charge. Amorim departed Old Trafford after 14 months at the helm, leaving the Red Devils languishing in sixth place.",
      "And while a club statement stated worries about performance were behind his exit, it was his fiery post-match remarks, which contained barely disguised swipes at the hierarchy, which ultimately proved to be his downfall. Now Neville has shared his thoughts on his former club and what they ought to consider when picking their next boss.",
      "Neville said: \"Ruben Amorim, a very different style from what Manchester United would ordinarily expect. I think these experiments have got to stop. I'm not being; 'Manchester United, look at us, this is what we do'\".",
      "\"To be fair to Ruben Amorim, I think when he was offered the job, he said; 'No, I prefer to take it in the summer when you can adapt to my system and you can recruit towards it' - he did say that but then Manchester United sort of said; 'It's now or never'.",
      "\"The lure of Manchester United and being the manager is something that is difficult to turn down, but he did call this out on the way in. I actually thought that Manchester United would adapt a lot better to the three [at the back] than they did.",
      "\"I'm really stunned that over the period of time that Ruben Amorim has been at the club that they continued to play so poorly in that system. I get it, it's a difficult system - wing-backs are challenging, it's not a role that young full-backs grow up playing anymore in Europe.",
      "\"Similarly, those two in behind the centre-forward are difficult because you've got to be in the pockets and then out sometimes to have to defend and chase back with the full-back of the opposition team. So there are quite specialist positions within the system Ruben Amorim plays, with the centre-backs, as well. But I can't believe how badly they have adapted to it and how inconsistent they've been with it.",
      "\"That's a failing upon the manager, that's a failing upon the players and it's a failure upon the club in terms of not recruiting properly for it. However, thinking about it all this morning and travelling down to London at 10 o'clock and I was thinking; 'What managers that have been appointed at the club over the last 10-12 years' - Louis van Gaal has his own philosophy, Jose Mourinho plays a certain style of football, so does David Moyes; Erik ten Hag, again a different style of football, very positional, very different to what Manchester United would ordinarily play.",
      "Neville then emphasised United shouldn't alter their identity, but rather bring in a boss who matches their club's ethos. \"Manchester United must take risks and play aggressive, attacking football. Manchester United have now got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their football club. Ajax will never change for anybody; Barcelona will never change for anybody: I don't believe Manchester United should change for anybody. They should play the way in which they play.",
      "\"These managers that have come in are fantastic managers - Van Gaal, Mourinho, Ten Hag, Amorim - all brilliant coaches, you can't say they're not good coaches. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. But they've all come in with different approaches, different styles of play, different philosophies, and none of them really fit the Manchester United way.",
      "\"So for me it's about finding a manager with the experience who is willing to play fast, entertaining, aggressive, attacking football, and it's as simple as that.\"",
      "United icon Darren Fletcher has stepped in as caretaker boss for the time being, while the hunt for a permanent manager gets underway.",

      "Former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has already delivered a glowing assessment of Oliver Glasner. The Crystal Palace boss is one of several names to have been linked with the United job following the club’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "The writing appeared to be on the wall for the Portuguese coach after his side’s draw with Leeds United at the weekend. The United manager was outspoken about his role at the club and his departure was confirmed on Monday.",
      "In his post-match press conference, Amorim said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear. I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change.”",
      "United have announced that club icon Darren Fletcher will take charge on a temporary basis. While the Scotsman will hope to impress during his time in the hot seat, Palace manager Glasner is reportedly among the top candidates to be the next permanent United boss.",
      "The 51-year-old has made a huge impression since joining Palace in February 2024, leading the Eagles to a first-ever major trophy in the FA Cup last season and following that up with a Community Shield triumph in August. While Glasner quickly earned plaudits in English football, ex-United boss Rangnick was already aware that the Austrian was a quality coach.",
      "\"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach,\" Rangnick told LAOLA1 in March 2023.",
      "Before taking over at Palace, Glasner won the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022. However, it was Rangnick who helped start Glasner’s coaching journey during his time as Red Bull Salzburg’s director of football, naming him as Roger Schmidt’s assistant.",
      "\"He developed step by step to where he is now, also because he made the right decisions,” Rangnick explained. “From his perspective, it was right to go to Ried, from Ried to Linz, from Linz to Wolfsburg.",
      "“When you see what's happening with him and Markus Krosche at Eintracht Frankfurt, you can only take your hat off to him. This is a prime example of how a coach's career should develop. It couldn't have been written down better beforehand.\"",
      "Whether Glasner’s next step will take him to Old Trafford remains to be seen, though his Palace contract is due to expire at the end of the season. Rangnick would likely have some words of advice for Glasner following his difficult spell as interim United boss in the 2021/22 campaign, which saw the 67-year-old scrap plans to remain with the Red Devils in a consultancy role.",
      "Former United defender Rio Ferdinand is adamant that the Palace manager will not be appointed by the club, as his preferred formation is similar to Amorim’s back-three system. However, Glasner has demonstrated how a 3-4-3 formation can be successful in the Premier League and previously compared his team to Amorim’s side.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner said earlier this season. \"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it. It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's successor at Manchester United could look at changing four rules the Portuguese manager told his players to abide by in the coming weeks. The 40-year-old was sacked by the club after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Leeds United, leaving the Reds sixth in the table.",
      "His exit follows explosive comments he made after the game at Elland Road, taking thinly veiled digs at the club’s board and suggesting he had little control over the club’s direction. Amorim then poured more fuel on the fire by telling reporters he would be the 'manager' of United rather than the 'coach.'",
      "After just 14 months in charge, his tenure has come to an end. United icon Darren Fletcher, previously the club's under-18s coach following a stint as technical director, has been placed in interim charge for their game at Burnley.",
      "No immediate successor has been identified, though Oliver Glasner has emerged as the bookmakers' early favourite, with Gareth Southgate and Mauricio Pochettino following in second and third respectively.",
      "No using international breaks for holidays",
      "Players have been prohibited from jetting off during international breaks if their nation doesn't select them. Amorim's thought behind the decision was based on rest and limiting travel.",
      "\"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly,\" he explained at the time. \"This is something that us as a club have to decided.",
      "\"So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "No food in the dressing room",
      "Bringing food to the dressing room on matchdays was another rule set by Amorim. This was introduced as part of a push on elite conditioning.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win,\" he stated in December of 2024. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win.\"",
      "Losing team in training picks up equipment",
      "This rule was introduced to foster accountability. When the team splits into two sides during a training ground match, the losing side must pick up all of the equipment.",
      "\"Everyone wants to be the team that wins,\" Toby Collyer previously told The Athletic. \"You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Diogo Dalot previously admitted that pre-season standards had risen compared to last year.",
      "\"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards,\" he siad. \"If you can't match them, it's not a place for you.\"",
      "No complex instructions from coaches",
      "During the first few weeks of his tenure, Amorim made it clear that his coaches were not to give overly complex instructions to the players.",
      "By avoiding coaches bogging players down with overly complicated instructions, the squad can learn their roles properly and execute them on the pitch.",

      "Manchester United's hunt for a new manager is back underway following Ruben Amorim's sacking, with free agent Xavi re-emerging as an option once more. The Spaniard has been without a club since departing Barcelona in 2024 and has previously expressed his interest in managing in England.",
      "United confirmed Amorim's dismissal on Monday, less than 24 hours after a frustrating 1-1 stalemate at Leeds. Yet it was his post-match remarks, where he criticised certain board members for not concentrating on their own responsibilities, that likely proved to be the final straw.",
      "Xavi, 45, has previous connections with United chief executive officer Omar Berrada from his time at the Camp Nou prior to his departure in 2011. The duo could now be set for a reunion on English soil, where Xavi has expressed his willingness to take on a future role.",
      "\"Of course? Where, I don't know,\" he revealed to The Athletic when asked about his prospects last year. \"There's no hurry for me, but I'd like a good project.",
      "\"Like, 'You have four years to work and make a project.' I'd love to work in the Premier League, because I love the passion there.",
      "\"In Spain, it's too much about the result. Or a national team, that would appeal. When I dreamed about being a coach, I dreamed about being in a World Cup or European Championship.\"",
      "Despite United's top brass possibly growing weary of Amorim's stubbornness to stick to his preferred tactics, they were fundamentally committed to a long-term vision, which aligns with Xavi's main criteria.",
      "Amorim managed to reach the Europa League final last season but didn't secure any major silverware during his tenure at United. He also presided over the club's worst Premier League finish, ending up in 15th place last season.",
      "One could argue Amorim's dismissal was overdue, and some of United's rivals may have shown him the door much earlier. There were also rumours of discontent among certain board members, with director of scouting Christopher Vivell and director of football Jason Wilcox reportedly dissatisfied with his approach.",
      "It's likely that time will be needed to dismantle Amorim's United if his successor decides to revert to a four-man defence. In this regard, Xavi could be the perfect choice, favouring a back four that can shift into a three-man defence when necessary.",
      "Xavi was previously considered for the Old Trafford hot seat when Erik ten Hag was given the boot in October 2024. At the time, it was reported Berrada led a four-man delegation to Barcelona to discuss the opportunity with Xavi face-to-face.",
      "Just over a year later, United find themselves in a strikingly similar situation, with Berrada possibly looking to reignite those talks. If Xavi still has aspirations to manage among England's top tier, he knows he already has an interested party.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "For all the talk about the myriad facets needed to be a successful manager of an elite football team, there is one quality that trumps all others. Get the best out of the players. Simple as that.",
      "Yes, being a good communicator with the wider audience outside the dressing room can help. Getting on with the suits upstairs clearly helps, as Ruben Amorim can testify. Having a good agent, knowing good agents, helps. Not being English, that also helps, it seems. But the bottom line is that if you get the very best out of what is at your disposal, you will make a decent fist of things.",
      "As England manager, Gareth Southgate was many things. He was, indeed, a good communicator. He was a Football Association man, to the blazer born. He was a diplomat. He was squeaky-clean. He ruffled a few feathers.",
      "But those traits were merely bit-part reasons why England reached two European Championship finals, one World Cup semi-final and a World Cup quarter-final under his guidance. The main reason is he got the best out of the players at his disposal. Big players responded to Southgate’s management.",
      "Harry Kane and Declan Rice are now titans of the game, class-leading global players. And they would have got there via their own determination and talent.",
      "But speak to both of those players and they will tell you what they see as the hugely important role Southgate played in their development as footballers, professionals and individuals. And they are not the only ones from the England squads of the past decade.",
      "For those of us who closely covered the long camps for his four major tournaments as national boss, it was obvious the admiration and respect from players was pretty much total. And the same goes for his staff - and his bosses.",
      "With his friend’s time in power at Old Trafford proving to be brief, the case for Southgate has lost a boardroom advocate. But just because Dan Ashworth is no longer there, that should not dissuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe from looking towards Southgate.",
      "Apparently, the two have spoken recently. I’m not sure Southgate’s politics would match Sir Jim’s but it would be a minor hurdle. There are, though, a couple of main planks to the counter-Southgate argument put forward by what seems to be a large swathe of the United fanbase.",
      "He was rubbish as Middlesbrough manager, for starters. True, but that was over 16 years ago and he has done a lot of management and coaching learning since then.",
      "And mainly, they say, his style of play is ultra-conservative. Well, it’s not buccaneering, that is for sure.",
      "But England scored 213 goals in his 102-match reign. At tournaments, they often played percentage football that is often seen in that context but at World Cup 2022, his team scored 13 times in five games.",
      "But no, maybe he is not overly adventurous. Maybe, though, organisation, a clear plan, and motivation are what this disparate and dysfunctional squad has desperately needed for a very, very long time.",
      "There have been suggestions that 55-year-old Sir Gareth might not want the stress that would inevitably go with such a pressurised role. But at the very least, Sir Jim should make it his business to find out.",

      "The powerbrokers at Old Trafford find themselves looking for a new manager for the second time in less than 18 months after dismissing Ruben Amorim on Monday. The Portuguese head coach was given his marching orders amid mounting tensions in the north west, with his explosive post-match press conference at Leeds proving to be his last act.",
      "Darren Fletcher will take charge in midweek against Burnley with the plan being to appoint a caretaker manager until the end of the season before pursuing a permanent boss in the summer.",
      "The likes of Oliver Glasner and Xavi have already been touted as options as speculation over United's next manager ramps up. And while Arteta, currently enjoying life at his old club, Arsenal, is not in the conversation, it was put to Ferdinand that Arteta would turn the Red Devils down - but the former United defender wasn't having it. \"Nah, I don’t buy it, I do not buy it,\" he said on the latest episode of Rio Ferdinand Presents. \"He’s never gonna say it, he would never say it out loud. But I’m telling you, Mikel Arteta would sit there [and consider it].\"",
      "Arteta has overseen a huge turnaround at the Emirates having taken charge more than six years ago. He is without a trophy since 2020 but has helped the Gunners re-establish themselves as a force, domestically and in Europe. His team boast some of the globe's best players, including Declan Rice and William Saliba.",

The Portuguese head coach leaves with the team three points outside the top four, but with performances remaining an issue.",
      "Amorim's outspoken nature also counted against him eventually. Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: \"I saw his last two press conferences and I was thinking, 'Something isn’t right here'… this guy, one of his best traits and most likeable things has been his ability to be quite punchy in his press conferences, upbeat, jovial.

      "Amorim ultimately left after tactical rigidity, particularly his insistence on a 3-4-3 system, caused clashes with the board and left players frustrated. Former player Darren Fletcher has been named interim coach, but the search for a permanent replacement is underway.",
      "With over £200million spent on signings last summer failing to deliver results, the next manager faces a club in urgent need of a clear plan. Foster argued United now need someone with a commanding presence to lift pressure off the squad and warned about the internal power struggles any new manager would face.",
      "He said: \"I get the impression they need somebody with a big character, a lot of authority and almost a bit of an aura to take ‎that pressure away from the players.",
      "\"I just think there's too many chefs trying to stir the broth of Manchester‎ United. There's too many people who are so unwilling to relinquish the bit of power that they have at United, whether it's chief execs or the director of football.",
      "\"No manager now will be able to come into United and just have full autonomy or the full say so and be able to do whatever they want to do.\"",
      "While Emery has impressed at Villa, considerable doubts remain over whether he would leave for Old Trafford. The Spaniard is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's most effective managers, having led Villa to consistent top-half finishes and regular European qualification.",
      "Emery appears settled at Villa Park, where he has enjoyed strong backing from the club's hierarchy and overseen a period of stability and progress. However, after mixed spells at Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, the 54-year-old may yet be tempted by another opportunity at one of Europe's traditional heavyweights.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim was his own worst enemy with repeated public criticism of those within the club. Players were often the direct targets, while his comments after the weekend draw with Leeds, hinting at dissatisfaction with the club's decision makers, proved to be the final straw.",
      "United sacked Amorim on Monday, with the team sixth in the Premier League. A return to the Champions League looked possible, with a three-point gap to fourth-place Liverpool after 20 games, and the club indicated the decision to dismiss the head coach was made with a view to securing \"the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\".",
      "In January 2025, the Portuguese suggested his United crop might have been the worst in the club's history. And his willingness to throw players under the bus resurfaced in August after the Premier League side were beaten by lower-league Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"To be really honest, every time that we have a defeat like that in the future I'm going to be like that,\" he said, refusing to apologise for saying his team looked \"completely lost\" during the cup tie. \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players. I think I cannot.",
      "\"This is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that at that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.\"",
      "Amorim was given several more months after that Grimsby game but the cracks started to appear before Sunday's draw away to Leeds United. The Guardian reports that a deteriorating relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox was a major factor, and the boss called out the higher-ups - albeit not by name - after what would prove to be his final game in charge.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United,\" he said. \"And that is clear. I know that my name is not (Thomas) Tuchel, it's not (Antonio) Conte, it's not (Jose) Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "The former Sporting boss didn't restrict his criticisms to experienced figures, either. Some of United's academy talents also came in for criticism in December, just weeks before Amorim's eventual departure.",
      "\"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said after youngsters Chido Obi and Harry Amass responded to his comments about their struggles. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.\"",

      "Later on Monday, Amorim was spotted leaving his Cheshire home with his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, looking surprisingly cheerful despite his recent job loss at Old Trafford. It appears the Portuguese coach took the news in stride, even managing to exchange friendly banter with photographers during a leisurely walk in the snow.",
      "The official statement from the club read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United.",

      "Ruben Amorim will have to part ways with nearly half of his severance package after being sacked by Manchester United. The ex-Sporting manager was shown the door on Monday morning, less than a day after he publicly criticised United's top figures in a heated press conference.",
      "Following the stalemate at Leeds United on Sunday afternoon, he seemed to challenge his superiors to let him do his job without meddling. His eyebrow-raising comments didn't go down well at Old Trafford, and Amorim paid the price by facing a swift dismissal.",
      "Due to the absence of a break clause in the contract he inked two years ago, the Red Devils will have to pay out his contract in full. Due to that, the 40-year-old is anticipated to pocket just over £10million.",
      "However, he won't be able to hold onto all that cash, with nearly half likely to be claimed by the taxman. As per OLBG, it would be subject to the additional tax rate in the UK, although the Portuguese boss wouldn't have to contribute towards National Insurance.",
      "This is because termination payments are typically exempt from National Insurance contributions, but United would have had to fork out an extra £1.5m as part of their own contributions as his employer.",
      "This will leave Amorim with just over £5.5m of his settlement to take home, with the UK treasury raking in more than £6m through tax deductions and United's contribution as his employer.",
      "Manchester United confirmed the dismissal of Amorim as head coach in a succinct statement. It read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "Enzo Maresca is one of the candidates to replace Ruben Amorim as Manchester United manager, having previously backed him to turn things around earlier in the season. Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, the day after he took aim at the United board with some provocative comments.",
      "The 41-year-old openly challenged the board over control behind the scenes at United following the 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday. United reacted swiftly by releasing a statement that announced his departure and the appointment as Darren Fletcher as interim boss.",
      "Attention has now turned to who could replace Amorim in the longer term, with the BBC reporting that the club wants to find a caretaker willing to take charge until the end of the season. That will then give them time to find a long-term successor to Amorim, who lasted 14 months in the hot seat.",
      "Maresca has emerged as a possible contender just four days after he parted company with Chelsea following a similar power struggle. The Italian had been in charge of the Blues since the summer of 2024 and had come up against Amorim's United side on a few occasions, coming off second best in the most recent meeting in September.",
      "Chelsea were beaten 2-1 at Old Trafford on September 20 in a match that saw both away goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and United midfielder Casemiro sent off. Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Maresca knew his team would face a difficult match, despite United's poor start to the campaign.",
      "\"The only thing I can say is that I really appreciate Ruben,\" Maresca said. \"I've watched Ruben games since he was in Sporting. He's a magnificent manager. Like all the managers, when you start a new project sometimes you can struggle a little bit more or a little bit less but at the end you're going to struggle. I don't have any doubt that he's a fantastic manager.\"",
      "Chelsea are now expected to appoint Strasbourg coach Liam Rosenior as Maresca's long-term replacement after the ex-Hull City boss flew into London on Sunday. United, meanwhile, will travel to Turf Moor to play Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday night.",
      "Depending on how fast chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox move, that could be Fletcher's only match as interim boss. Maresca has been linked with the role alongside fellow out-of-work managers Zinedine Zidane, Xavi Hernandez, Michael Carrick and Gareth Southgate.",

      "Amorim was sacked when the sun rose following United's draw against Leeds on Sunday, but he was true to his word from his first conference as he departed, pictured with a care-free look on his face hours after his dismissal.",
      "The 40-year-old has pocketed around £10million and will return to Portugal with his family. Now, the question at Old Trafford is who will be hired to replace Amorim on a permanent basis? Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are already of interest. Glasner has done a magnificent job during his stint at Selhurst Park, and his contract with Crystal Palace is set to expire at the end of the campaign.",
      "Iraola's contract at Bournemouth also expires in the summer, although are either of those coaches cut out for the United job? Glasner plays with five at the back - albeit the tactics within that system are different to Amorim's - while Iraola is hardly the flavour of the month at Bournemouth after a poor run of results.",
      "The bookmakers have priced Glaser, Gareth Southgate, Mauricio Pochettino, Unai Emery, Xavi, Iraola, and Zinedine Zidane as the most likely replacements, but United should consider the former Barcelona midfielder on that list, not the former midfielder who starred for Real Madrid.",
      "Although there is no standout candidate, Xavi makes more appeal than most. The Spaniard has been out of work since leaving Barcelona in 2024 and would be immediately available.",
      "Darren Fletcher will take charge against Burnley and United are considering hiring an interim manager to oversee for the remainder of the season, which could be Fletcher, but Ralf Rangnick's interim stint highlighted the risk of employing a coach who arrives with a short-term remit.",
      "Xavi took his second job in management at Barcelona in 2021, replacing Ronald Koeman, and he led Barcelona to their first La Liga title in four years in his first full season in charge.",
      "The 45-year-old took over at Barcelona during one of the club's most challenging periods due to financial issues, but he turned the team around and won the Spanish Supercopa alongside the league title.",
      "The manner in which Barcelona won their games was impressive. Xavi played with a 4-3-3, which was designed to be an attacking system, something United fans are crying out for after Amorim's tenure.",
      "Xavi reflected on his Barcelona stint and said that \"beyond trophies\", he was proud of trusting a new generation, promoting the likes of Lamine Yamal, Pau Cubarsi and Alejandro Balde.",
      "Several young players promoted by Xavi have had a crucial role in the success of his replacement, Hansi Flick. Xavi is a coach who understands the importance of believing in young players, which is another tick in the box when considering whether he would be a good fit for United.",
      "Xavi would not be fazed by managing at the biggest club in England. Barcelona are even bigger than United around the world, and the Catalan press are some of the harshest critics in global media.",
      "He would command respect in the dressing room as one of the finest midfielders to have ever played the game, and he learned from Pep Guardiola during their time at Barcelona.",
      "Mikel Arteta learned from Guardiola as part of his coaching staff at Manchester City and has significantly improved Arsenal. Enzo Maresca's reputation soared after working with Guardiola. Some clubs have looked for the next best alternative to Guardiola. Xavi might fit that billing for United.",
      "He speaks superb English and spoke warmly about United when in the press conference room at Old Trafford in 2023.",
      "This reporter attended Xavi's press conference that evening and couldn't help but think he could be a future manager of United. The cards have fallen into place to make that a reality.",

      "Oliver Glasner is a leading contender to replace Ruben Amorim as Manchester United head coach. The current Crystal Palace boss plays a back three but that isn't expected to count against him when Old Trafford chiefs consider who to appoint next.",
      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, with United sources expressing concern at the lack of progress under the 40-year-old and his failure to implement a more attacking style of play despite nearly 14 months in the job.",
      "Glasner is out of contract at Palace in the summer and could join without compensation then. United could make an approach for the Austrian this month, but given that Glasner threatened to quit in the summer when Marc Guehi was nearly sold to Liverpool, it is unlikely to go down well at Selhurst Park if he agitates to leave now.",
      "Nevertheless, Glasner is very keen on the Old Trafford vacancy and would be more than willing to make the switch in the summer. He has performed impressively in South London, guiding Palace to their first major trophy last year when they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final.",
      "They have been managing European commitments this season, and Glasner has made clear his dissatisfaction with Palace's recruitment. Thursday night fixtures in the Conference League have stretched resources, but although the Eagles have slipped to 14th in the Premier League, they are only four points behind Chelsea in fifth.",
      "United have handed Darren Fletcher interim control of first-team affairs and the former midfielder will take charge of the Premier League trip to Burnley on Wednesday and is likely to remain in the dugout for Sunday's FA Cup third-round tie with Brighton.",
      "By that stage, United's football structure, led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, will look to have decided on a course of action. They could look to appoint a caretaker boss until the end of the season, before reassessing.",
      "That would further strengthen Glasner's credentials. Although Palace would like to keep the 51-year-old, he has shown little appetite for extending his stay at the club.",
      "Before moving to the Premier League, Glasner was a Europa League winner with Eintracht Frankfurt and also had experience in his homeland and with VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Although he has favoured a back three system with Palace and a very similar shape to Amorim, his side have looked more comfortable in their formation than United often have.",

      "It was in October that Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to give Ruben Amorim three years to prove he is a \"great coach\". In the end, he didn't even get another three months. The man appointed as Manchester United's first head coach was sacked less than 19 hours after demanding to be the manager instead.",
      "What happened at Leeds looks to have been the final straw but conflict has been building for weeks, if not months. Amorim entered his press conference on Friday with a face like thunder and that stemmed from a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox earlier that day in which there was a clash between the pair.",
      "United's football structure had expected Amorim to adapt from his 3-4-2-1 system as the players became more settled but officials were starting to sense that the Portuguese head coach was never going to do that. In Friday's meeting, Amorim again reacted angrily when his system was raised.",
      "Amorim then poured fuel on the fire by refusing to answer questions as to why he had recently said he wouldn't get the \"time or money\" to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\".",
      "But United never promised him the cash to rebuild the squad in his image. When Amorim was approached to take over in November last year, it was agreed he would play his system at the start, with the team seen to be lacking a structure under former boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "The end of the Dutchman's reign had been characterised by end-to-end games with no control and the board felt Amorim's set-up could alleviate some of those issues. But it was agreed from the outset that he would adapt once he had his feet under the table.",
      "By Friday evening, club bosses had come to the conclusion he was never going to do so and felt they had no option but to make a change, with some fearing a slide down the table given the level of performances.",
      "It wasn't solely about Amorim moving from a back five to a back four, but more about the lack of an attacking evolution under the 40-year-old. His style of play has been passive and bland, and the draw with Wolves between Christmas and New Year went down particularly badly with the hierarchy at Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters demanded more attacking intent within that game but with the scores level Amorim replaced Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro. It was the kind of negative substitution that came to define his reign.",
      "The club had also been unimpressed with some of Amorim's comments in his media dealings. The criticisms of the academy and namechecking Harry Amass and Chido Obi went down particularly badly, but first-team players weren't immune either.",
      "There was disappointment internally at some veiled criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier in the season, as well as the reference to the anxiety felt when Patrick Dorgu had the ball back in November.",
      "Those issues contributed to the decision to sack Amorim on Monday morning, with Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada delivering the news personally. Although club chiefs have denied talk of a rift, it is clear there was conflict and this was a stunning breakdown in relations that left United's hierarchy with little choice but to axe a man they have all staked their reputations on in one way or another.",
      "Even when Ratcliffe made those comments in October, tensions were beginning to creep into working relationships at Carrington. Faith had ebbed away in Amorim's back three system and some of his emotional outbursts, particularly after games, weren't seen as being helpful.",
      "For Amorim's part, he was starting to show signs of frustration at working in a collaborative structure that didn't give him the power he craved. A £230million summer spending spree focused on players who could fit a back three or a back four, rather than signing specialists for the very particular roles in his system.",
      "If there was tension around transfers, that went both ways. Kobbie Mainoo has become a sticking point between Amorim and the structure around him. United were loath to lose another academy graduate, especially a player seen as one of the best to emerge at the club in recent years.",
      "But Amorim has made it clear he doesn't see Mainoo fitting into his 3-4-2-1 shape. He was tried as a No.10 last season, but the summer spending spree on attackers left him well down the pecking order there. The head coach harboured doubts about Mainoo's defensive work, particularly off the ball, and was reluctant to play him as one of the two deeper midfielders.",
      "This left United in a bind. Mainoo wanted to sign for Napoli on loan on deadline day but there was not enough time to bring in a replacement. United officials were also conscious of the optics of letting him go. But Amorim refused to hand him opportunities and Mainoo hasn't started a single Premier League game this season.",
      "The 20-year-old won't mourn the departure of his head coach and he looks certain to stay at Old Trafford now, rather than seek a temporary departure this month. He might also find chances easier to come by in a three-man midfield, a tactical approach Amorim refused to get on board with.",
      "There were concerns last season that his unique system wasn't translating to the Premier League and was too predictable. Those became sharper internally after the draw with Fulham earlier this season, when director of recruitment Christopher Vivell shared comments from Fulham boss Marco Silva that detailed how easy it was to prepare to face Amorim's United.",
      "When Rob Edwards made similar comments after the draw with Wolves last week, it set alarm bells ringing once again, particularly as that return to a back three came after Amorim had briefly considered a peace accord with Wilcox and co.",
      "His bosses had urged him to be more tactically adaptable and he duly played 4-3-3 against Newcastle on Boxing Day. It was a game from which conclusions were hard to draw, with United looking good in the first half and then hanging on in the second.",
      "Amorim had seen enough, however. He abandoned the flirtation with changing his system and decided if he was going down, it would be on his own sword. He had had enough of the interference from above and stuck to his own principles, with that tactical clash leading to some of the emotion he has shown in recent weeks.",
      "There was also conflict over transfers. United has sought to introduce a more integrated approach to recruitment since the Ineos takeover, but it has left Amorim unable to secure the players he really wanted. There was some tension of the identity of the striker signed in the summer, with United opting to move for Sesko, despite having a similar profile to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Those signings were players who United felt could play in a number of roles, but Amorim was sticking to his tactical guns rather than adapting as had been agreed.",
      "When he was asked about recruitment recently, he hinted that he and Wilcox didn't always agree but that every club should listen to the manager, because they know the style of play.",
      "Ultimately, Amorim's style of play wasn't winning anyone over at United, and his stubbornness eventually proved too much.",

      "Gary Neville has given his verdict on Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United, naming which match was the \"killer game\" for the club's former head coach. United announced on Monday that the club had parted ways with Amorim after 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was recently asked about the confidence he received from United's hierarchy, where the 40-year-old gave a lengthy explanation on his role at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything,\" Amorim said after United’s draw with Leeds on Sunday. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "\"Look, if there was a meeting on Friday morning about the performance against Wolves between the sporting director and the manager - I'd actually have been disappointed if there wasn't a meeting after the Wolves performance,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I think as a sporting director or owner of a football club, you should be entitled to go and speak to a manager when the team have played like they have against Wolves and basically Wolves have picked up a point at Old Trafford, only their third of the season.",
      "\"It seems to me that in the last week, Ruben Amorim has decided that he doesn't feel supported or he doesn't feel happy, he's called it out obviously in press conferences, decided to unleash at times and sort of be emotional and do what he does: I think he's always been honest, he's always done it with integrity, he's always speaking from the heart - we always enjoy his press conferences.",
      "\"But the reality of it is, when you turn on your bosses - it doesn't matter whether you're at a football club or you work in Morrisons - if you turn on your bosses, you're not going to keep your job very long.",
      "\"For me, the meeting between Jason Wilcox and Ruben Amorim after the Wolves game that took place, that absolutely would take place in every single football club.",
      "\"If Salford City had a game that they lost or drew that was bad, there would be a conversation between the sporting department and the manager, just like there would be from the manager to the sporting department if we weren't getting our targets in the January transfer window.",
      "\"These are conversations that have to happen, there has to be a level of honesty that occurs when there are disappointing results.",
      "\"Over the last five or six weeks, I've done probably every United game other than the Leeds and Crystal Palace games, and I've actually complimented United when I think they've performed well: against Bournemouth, when they drew 4-4, against Villa when they lost was a disappointing result but I thought there was something in the performance.",
      "\"But some of the performances in the last month... if you look at the Everton game, losing to 10 men when to be fair Ruben Amorim kept three at the back against one and they were basically trying to chase a goal against 10-man Everton.",
      "\"The performance against West Ham - everyone is beating West Ham and Manchester United drew at home and to be fair West Ham could've got more out of the game. Everyone is beating Wolves, Manchester United drew against Wolves.",
      "\"So if you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way.",
      "\"I actually thought against Leeds it was a decent performance, I thought it was a good point and he could have handled it differently after the game in the press conference but he didn't. The Wolves game to me seemed like the killer game, it was a bad one.\"",
      "Neville then turned to where United must go next after Amorim’s sacking, and why he was surprised by the departure.",
      "\"When a manager is sacked at any level - and obviously I'm a part-owner in a football club - it's a poor reflection on everybody; it means it's not worked, it means the decision-making all the way through has not been successful, it means the manager has not won enough football matches and that ultimately everybody loses,” Neville said.",
      "\"Particularly when you're sacking a manager part-way through a season it's difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"Manchester United have been here before. They're in a challenging position again. I am surprised it's happened this morning; I'm not surprised it's happened.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I think the last week or so, some of the press conferences that we've seen, it only ends one way. But I did think that they would get through another couple of weeks, try and work out what to do.",
      "\"But obviously it's become that challenging internally that they've decided to do it, which was a shock this morning at 10 o'clock when I heard the news.\"",

      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, less than 19 hours after a remarkable press conference at Elland Road in which he demanded more power and told director of football Jason Wilcox to \"do his job\". Tensions between Amorim and members of the football leadership team, including Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, have become public in recent weeks and Amorim laid them bare at Elland Road.",
      "His stunning remarks left nobody in any doubt that were issues behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Amorim's job came under immediate scrutiny and after what was essentially a 'back me or sack me' plea, his 63-game reign was brought to an end on Monday.",
      "But United sources insist that the decision was made solely on results and denied there had been any power struggles or that Amorim had laid down an ultimatum demanding more power. They insist the 40-year-old maintained the 'unwavering support' of everyone within the club but there hadn't been enough progress for him to continue in the role.",
      "Amorim had been frustrated at being told there was no money to spend in January and was keen to add a midfielder to his squad, with United initially showing interest in attacker Antoine Semenyo before tightening the purse strings.",
      "The decision was made to sign three attacking players last summer, in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, as well as goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and United insist Amorim was on board with that recruitment plan and happy with the decision to strengthen the attack over the midfield.",
      "In his press conference after the Leeds draw, Amorim had demanded to be the manager at United rather than the coach, even though his job title since his appointment in November 2024 was head coach. United have no plans to change that structure and their next appointment is likely to have to accept the same job title.",
      "United sources point out that the £250million spent since Amorim's arrival made the club one of the highest spenders in the Premier League in that time. Although the team have shown signs of improvement this season and sit sixth in the Premier League, the decision has been made to axe Amorim to give the squad a better chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season.",

Former midfielder Fletcher will officially take charge of United's Premier League trip to Burnley on Wednesday night and is expected to remain in the dugout for the FA Cup tie with Brighton on Sunday.",
      "The 41-year-old oversaw a smaller training session, mostly comprising academy players, on Monday morning, with those involved in the match against Leeds on Sunday going through a recovery session. Fletcher will take his first proper session on Tuesday before holding a press conference to preview the trip to Turf Moor. Although he has no senior management experience, he was part of Erik ten Hag's first-team staff and made 342 appearances for the club as a player.",
      "United sources contrasted that level of experience with Chelsea's caretaker boss, Calum McFarlane, who stepped up from academy football in the wake of Enzo Maresca's sacking.",
      "That is why there is faith in Fletcher to guide the club through a tricky period as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their options. Although a permanent appointment could be made now, there is a feeling that it might make sense to wait until the end of the season, when the field of candidates could be greater. That could lead to a caretaker being appointed until the end of the season.",

      "The Palace boss is also said to have threatened to walk away from Selhurst Park if they sold defender Marc Guehi on transfer deadline day this summer.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim became his own worst enemy through relentless public criticism of individuals at the club. Players frequently found themselves in the firing line, whilst his remarks following the weekend stalemate with Leeds, suggesting displeasure with the club's hierarchy, ultimately sealed his fate.",
      "In January 2025, the Portuguese manager claimed his United squad could be the worst in the club's illustrious history. His tendency to publicly criticise players re-emerged in August following the Premier League outfit's shock defeat to lower-division Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"To be really honest, every time that we have a defeat like that in the future I'm going to be like that,\" he declared, refusing to apologise for describing his team as appearing \"completely lost\" during the cup encounter. \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players. I think I cannot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"This is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that at that moment I was so frustrated and annoyed. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.\"",
      "Amorim was afforded several additional months following that Grimsby fixture, but tensions began to emerge prior to Sunday's stalemate against Leeds United away from home. According to The Guardian, a worsening relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox played a significant role, with the manager criticising senior figures - though without naming them directly - following what would ultimately be his last match in charge.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United,\" he said. \"And that is clear. I know that my name is not (Thomas) Tuchel, it's not (Antonio) Conte, it's not (Jose) Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "The ex-Sporting manager didn't limit his disapproval to seasoned personnel, however. Several of United's youth prospects also faced censure in December, mere weeks prior to Amorim's ultimate exit.",
      "\"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he commented, following the reactions of young players Chido Obi and Harry Amass to his remarks about their challenges. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.\"",
      "He further stated: \"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.\"",

      "An official statement from the club read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.

      "The United U18s head coach will step up to oversee the first-team's Premier League outing with Burnley on Wednesday. However, should he impress in that match, the Reds may give him free reign him to take control until the summer.",
      "The former Manchester United star has been out of work since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last June. He has previously provided support as a caretaker manager in 2021 in the wake of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's exit, and could potentially do so again given his relationship with the club.",
      "The Manchester United legend was at the wheel between 2018 and 2021, but failed to enjoy the same glory at Old Trafford which he did as a player under Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious tenure. The 52-year-old was sacked by Besiktas in August, and could be eager to pick up where he left off on English soil.",

      "The former Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Aston Villa defender hasn't been involved in the management game since stepping down from the England national team following Euro 2024. However, an interim role could give Southgate the opportunity to dip a toe once again without the need for a long-term commitment.",
      "The Dutchman took charge of United on a caretaker basis in the wake of Erik ten Hag's dismissal in October 2024, ahead of the arrival of Amorim. He managed three wins and a draw before moving on to Leicester City, where he left by mutual consent last summer."

      "The 44-year-old succeeded Erik ten Hag in November 2024 - a decision which forced United to pay a compensation bill of £10.4million to the Dutchman and his coaching staff at the time. And doubts over the future of Amorim emerged after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, with the Portuguese hinting he might depart when his contract expires in 18 months.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed he would \"put all my money on\" Oliver Glasner not being appointed as Ruben Amorim's replacement at Manchester United.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Glasner, 51, has emerged as a contender to succeed Amorim at Old Trafford after the club decided to sack the Portuguese head coach on Monday morning.",
      "Glasner has done a stellar job since joining Palace in February 2024, guiding them to FA Cup glory at the end of last season and then the Community Shield at the start of this campaign. During his time in south London, the ex-Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt boss has won 41 and drawn 28 of his 93 matches in charge.",
      "With United deciding to axe Amorim, Glasner has been linked with becoming the next United head coach. However, Ferdinand doesn't see the Reds appointing Glasner, due to the fact he uses a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "\"No way,\" ex-United defender Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents when asked about the possibility of Glasner taking over. \"There's no way, I don't think. I would be so surprised if Glasner gets an opportunity to be Man United manager given that he plays three-at-the-back.",
      "\"Based on how this team has performed and the narrative that has been surrounding the team since Amorim has been here: I would put all my money on it that he doesn't get that job.\"",
      "Amorim had faced pressure for sticking with his three-at-the-back system despite performances and results not improving at the race some were hoping for. Indeed, after using his tried-and-trusted 3-4-2-1 formation for most of last Tuesday's 1-1 draw against rock bottom Wolves, Amorim was scrutinised even more.",
      "Glasner, meanwhile, has enjoyed success with his 3-4-3 shape at Palace. Marc Guehi, Maxence Lacroix and Chris Richards are the three that have typically provided a solid foundation at the back, with Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell giving width as the two wing-backs. Adam Wharton and one of Will Hughes or Jefferson Lerma have been used as the midfield two, followed by a dynamic front three including Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "It's a system that has worked for Glasner, with Palace riding the crest of a wave in their first-ever European campaign and sitting comfortable in mid-table in the Premier League. Although the Eagles have lost four of their last five top-flight matches, they still sit just four points behind fifth-place Chelsea in the table.",
      "As for United, Darren Fletcher is set to take charge on an interim basis for Wednesday's trip to Burnley. They will be looking to return to winning ways after back-to-back draws against Wolves and Leeds United.",

      "Dan Ashworth would have known the end was coming at Manchester United when he was marched through the press conference room soon after the defeat to Nottingham Forest in December 2024. This was a public sacking for a figure who had gone from hero to zero in five months in the eyes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ashworth was the man Ratcliffe called \"one of the best sporting directors in the world\" during protracted negotiations with Newcastle to lure him to Old Trafford. However, within months, relations had soured. It reflected poorly on Ratcliffe at the time and now, with the dismissal of Ruben Amorim, the manager over whom Ashworth had so many reservations, even worse.",
      "Ratcliffe could have picked up the phone to anyone in the game and been told Ashworth was a structures guy, not the kind of sporting director who would hand over a list of the five most highly rated 30-something coaches in Europe. He was a sensible appointment for a club that needed reshaping. But his caution over the appointment of Amorim ultimately did for him.",
      "Ashworth could see the problems coming of parachuting in a head coach mid-season who had a distinctive playing style. This wasn't a squad built for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and neither did United have the cash to transform it.",
      "It was a sensible, pragmatic, common-sense approach, but didn't fit with the bravado and excitement of everyone else involved. Amorim was the shiny new toy, the up-and-coming coach who had built an excellent reputation at Sporting and when he guided his old club to a 4-1 win against Manchester City in November 2024, Old Trafford had fallen head over heels.",
      "In hindsight, now that the Portuguese has been unceremoniously sent packing after just 14 months at the helm, the concerns Ashworth highlighted were correct. Amorim might still be an excellent coach (or manager), and with the right players, his system might be a success somewhere. But these weren't conditions he was ever likely to encounter at United and it's been proven.",
      "Instead, he played his system without the tools to do and his team became too predictable as a result. Most of the best managers in the game have a fairly distinctive style of play, but it is often unstoppable because they have the players to execute it. Not at Old Trafford. Not for Amorim.",
      "When his bosses were telling him to change the system and that there was no money, it was hard to see how he would ever survive and create a successful team. That chance is now gone.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada are damaged by the episode, their reputations at the club linked to Amorim's appointment. This was their big call and it has gone horribly wrong.",
      "It will take some explaining away when there was at least one senior figure in the building sounding the alarm bells. They ignored that warning and pressed ahead anyway. The surprise is the nature of the unravelling. less than 14 months on, not that it happened.",
      "So now, does Ratcliffe trust Wilcox and Berrada to get the next appointment right? Ratcliffe himself has hitched himself to the success of a head coach he likes.",
      "The 73-year-old was desperate for his first appointment to be the right one, but that has not happened. Now, the past 14 months feel like a waste. United are no further on than when Erik ten Hag was sacked - and the Dutchman won trophies, in fairness to him.",
      "Ashworth might have advocated an appointment considered safer, maybe even a little more boring. He would have been panned for pushing Gareth Southgate's credentials and Thomas Frank has struggled with the step up from Brentford to Tottenham. But in pointing out the pitfalls of going for Amorim, he could see what was likely to happen.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is among those being touted for a move to Manchester United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim by Old Trafford bosses. Earlier this season, the Austrian's remarks suggested that United had made progress under the Portuguese coach's leadership, but his departure tells a different story.",
      "United had a dismal 2025, ending the season in 15th place with a mere 42 points in the Premier League and only nine victories - their worst performance in the competition's history. This season they've amassed 31 points from 20 matches and sit in sixth place.",
      "While there has been an improvement in terms of points gained, the team's performances have been lacklustre as they struggled to adapt to Amorim's 3-4-3 formation. A draw against relegation-threatened Wolves and a point at Elland Road last weekend led to a fiery post-match press conference from Amorim, where he criticised the club's management and former player Gary Neville.",
      "United issued a statement confirming Amorim's sacking, emphasising their ambition to finish the season as high up the table as possible.",
      "Glasner, who recently led the Eagles to FA Cup and Community Shield victories, is one of the names linked with the now vacant managerial role at United, and his tactical approach aligns closely with that of the now-departed Amorim.",
      "Speaking earlier this season about United's approach under the Portuguese manager, Glasner defended Amorim by highlighting the team's statistical performance.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said back in November.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and invested £200m - buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, that's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now.",
      "\"I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Glasner could represent an immediate solution to replace Amorim, whilst his own situation at Selhurst Park remains uncertain with his contract due to run out this summer. The Austrian is yet to sign fresh terms with the Eagles and might prove to be the solution to United's difficulties.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner said earlier this season when explaining the benefits of lining up in a 3-4-3.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",

      "After sacking Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a big decision to make.",
      "Manchester United have shown flashes of promise this season, but a run of disappointing results - coupled with a breakdown in relations between manager and ownership - led to the axe falling on the Portuguese coach after just 14 months in charge.",
      "Attention now turns to Amorim's successor. While the Red Devils will have no shortage of candidates, one manager Ratcliffe has previously admitted admiring may prove far harder to persuade.",
      "That man is Jurgen Klopp, who famously led Liverpool to both Premier League and Champions League glory. Ratcliffe has waxed lyrical about the German in the past, suggesting that Klopp could well be a dream target of his.",
      "\"Klopp has this ability to drive his players to a frenzy,\" he said back in March 2024, shortly after taking over footballing operations at Old Trafford. \"Total commitment on the pitch. And, you know, that's one of the things a good coach can do.\"",
      "Klopp is currently Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, having joined the company shortly after leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "He has previously insisted that his time at Liverpool would be his last in management. Combined with the fierce rivalry between the two clubs, a move to Old Trafford appears supremely unlikely.",
      "Instead, the Red Devils will have to turn their attention to other, more realistic targets. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner is thought to be among the favourites for the role, along with former England head coach Gareth Southgate - another man long admired by Ratcliffe.",
      "Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Aston Villa's Unai Emery and former United defender Laurent Blanc are also being linked. For now, however, U-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge on an interim basis until a permanent successor is named.",
      "In a statement on Monday morning, United confirmed Amorim's departure. \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Amorim's departure comes in the wake of United's 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday. Speaking after the game, the 40-year-old hinted at tensions behind the scenes, insisting he considered himself \"manager\" of United, rather than simply \"coach\".",
      "\"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change,\" Amorim said. \"That was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",

      "It was also confirmed in the statement that Darren Fletcher will take charge of Wednesday’s Premier League game against Burnley. United will head to Turf Moor sixth in the top-flight after a 1-1 draw at Leeds United yesterday afternoon.",

      "The Reds then kick-off February with a home game against Fulham. Following United’s 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday, Amorim delivered an explosive press conference in which he made a number of remarks.",
      "He insisted he is the manager, not the coach of United, and challenged his sporting director and scouting department “to do their job”.",
      "Amorim also hinted he could leave when his current deal runs out in 18 months time - if he wasn't sacked before then.",
      "He said: “Guys, to stop with that — and I noticed that you receive selective information about everything — I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.",
      "“That is clear. I know that my name is not Tuchel, it’s not Conte, it’s not Mourinho, but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",

      "“I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months. And then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "“Every department, the scouting department, the sports director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.”",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United have spent nearly £2billion on 75 players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. We’ve ranked them all.",
      "That is an absolutely incredible amount of money for having won no Premier League titles and to have consistently fallen in and out of the Champions League.",
      "The Red Devils finished 15th under Ruben Amorim last season and have now sacked the Portuguese, with some of his signings pretty high on this list, but none in the top 10…",
      "And now, with talk that Manchester United could have signed Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but instead plumped for Cristiano Ronaldo, Donny van de Beek and Jadon Sancho, we bring you the full updated ranking…",
      "",
      "The Red Devils signed one of the best players in the Premier League on astronomical wages and he seemed to become an incompetent footballer overnight. Nice piano, though.",
      "",
      "Time is up for Sancho at Man Utd. And Chelsea. They paid £5million so they don’t have to sign him permanently. Now at Aston Villa for a season before leaving United for absolutely nothing.",
      "",
      "Who? Exactly.",
      "",
      "Another player who joined with a huge reputation; Falcao failed to rediscover his FC Porto and Atletico Madrid form during his spell with Man Utd and then Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we wrote before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. In the end he exited for less than £22m and United felt lucky to get that.",
      "",
      "After signing Benjamin Sesko, United froze Hojlund out against his will. We feel sorry for him, but scoring four goals in 32 matches last season after costing over £60m is unacceptable. He’s doing a little better back in Serie A with Napoli.",
      "",
      "Joining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",
      "",
      "Wearing the No. 7 shirt has become something of a curse since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009; even for the Portuguese himself.",
      "Depay came in as a terrific youngster from the Netherlands and took on the famous number. The forward scored seven goals in 53 games and left for Lyon for a little over half of what Man Utd paid for him.",
      "",
      "Schneiderlin was great for Southampton, so Louis van Gaal brought him to Old Trafford where the Frenchman was nowhere near good enough. He left for £20m, so it’s not all bad. Bloody Everton.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "United fumbled a decent goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "When Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",
      "",
      "Brought in for the rest of the season in January 2022 after Dubravka’s loan ended. Butland did not make a single appearance for the club.",
      "",
      "Oh my, simply a shambolic signing. We thought Onana was a serious upgrade on David de Gea, but he was a disastrous downgrade. That says a lot as well, because De Gea was awfully error-prone in his last season at Old Trafford.",
      "Onana made some catastrophic errors for United and is now on loan at Trabzonspor watching his value plummet.",
      "",
      "That is an absurd loan fee for an average player.",
      "",
      "The Uruguayan right-back played four times in the Premier League for Man Utd.",
      "",
      "Van de Beek’s demise wasn’t completely down to his poor performances, but more down to the fact that he could barely get a kick. He spent a completely bizarre four years as a Manchester United player, making 62 appearances and scoring twice.",
      "",
      "Schweinsteiger is a Bayern Munich legend and a forgettable Manchester United midfielder.",
      "",
      "Fits the home-grown quota and joined Manchester United for no other reason.",
      "",
      "Yes, this happened. And yes, we forgot until now.",
      "",
      "Both player and club could have done without this move.",
      "",
      "See Lee Grant. But Heaton was a free transfer.",
      "",
      "Signed as a back-up goalkeeper. Is a back-up goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "There has to be a point when you put your neck on the line and say this guy might not be very good. PSG sold him after one year and then won the Treble, while his new club went from finishing eighth to 15th. Ugarte has looked off the pace from day one and needs to show remarkable improvement to win us, and many others, over.",
      "",
      "James was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",
      "",
      "Erratic and amusing, Bailly was signed for big money and was more comical than he was convincing at defending. Injuries didn’t help him, to be fair.",
      "",
      "He scored a decent amount of goals but didn’t do enough to merit a £76m transfer fee.",
      "",
      "Having paid no transfer fee for the young Dutch winger, Man Utd looked like they did pretty well. He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, where he did quite well.",
      "The Red Devils were right to sell Chong but definitely could have sold him for more.",
      "",
      "Fosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",
      "",
      "The Italian was bang average for United and was only sold for £2m.",
      "",
      "Often erratic, Rojo was box office at times but had an average spell at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Weghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "He cost an absolute fortune with only a year left on his Chelsea contract and even when fit, he has been very underwhelming.",
      "We all know the ability Mount possesses and we finally got a glimpse in the early stages of this season before, you guessed it, he got injured.",
      "",
      "Pogba left United for Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, only to be re-signed by the Premier League club for a world-record transfer fee, to then return to Turin on a free transfer in 2022.",
      "He was excellent in fits and starts but nowhere near consistent enough. Especially for a world-record transfer.",
      "",
      "The other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",
      "",
      "It’s going to be interesting to see how he’s utilised now that Amorim is gone.",
      "",
      "Bought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri joined Burnley permanently for £5.5m and helped them gain promotion to the Premier League as one of Scott Parker’s most important players.",
      "",
      "Malacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "We can’t do anything more than shrug and swiftly move on.",
      "",
      "The jury is very much out, but we suspect they are ambling towards a ‘Guilty of being massively overpriced’ verdict.",
      "",
      "The jury is most certainly out on this one. He has the work-rate and pace necessary to thrive in wing-back. Now that Amorim is gone, he could be screwed.",
      "",
      "Often the scapegoat and always mocked, the former Man Utd captain has put in many good displays for the club. He’s also made many high-profile errors. Definitely not worth the money he cost, but definitely not as bad as people say.",
      "",
      "Man Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "There was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m.",
      "",
      "Blind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "Telles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "This club and their extortionate loan fees…",
      "",
      "Lindelof was painfully average and nowhere near the levels required for a £31.5m defender signed in 2017. Now doing a job at Aston Villa after leaving for free.",
      "",
      "Fellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "Martial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He eventually joined AEK Athens on a free transfer.",
      "",
      "Wan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "Varane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "As far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "Yoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "It is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another. So far, so average.",
      "",
      "He is comfortably the best signing made in the summer of 2024. Low bar, mind.",
      "",
      "As far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "Competent. And that really is enough.",
      "",
      "Not quite delivered numbers-wise in the early part of 2025/26, but he has fire. And in a sea of sometimes looking like they don’t give a sh*t, that counts for something.",
      "",
      "David Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "A few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club. Still, £53m is steeeeeeep.",
      "",
      "Martinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. After emerging as the club’s most competent defender, he suffered some bad injuries. He’s back now, and is looking pretty good.",
      "",
      "The fact that Eriksen cost nothing carries lots of weight. We expected more, but still don’t feel massively underwhelmed.",
      "",
      "He might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "Immediately looks like a Manchester United player. Which is less of a compliment than it was 20 years ago, but still…",
      "",
      "Seventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "Dalot is a pretty inconsistent player. He definitely suits a back four more than he does a back five. So, he might become quite good now.",
      "",
      "After a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was pretty much written off. However, his Sunderland loan was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which now looks somewhat reasonable, when it looked frankly ridiculous for a long time.",
      "",
      "Herrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "There’s not a lot to say that has not already been said; £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "After spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was available and willing to join.",

Alternatively, it’ll be ‘someone like Yan Diomande, who could have significant interest, and they’ll need to move fast on them’.",

      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein was the first to reveal that Man Utd have made the choice to sack Amorim on Monday after his rant against the hierarchy on Sunday.",
      "Man Utd were sixth in the Premier League after a 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday but the Red Devils are still just four points off 14th-placed Crystal Palace.",
      "And the Red Devils later confirmed Amorim had left the club in a statement, which read: ‘Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "‘Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "And now Jacobs insists that sacking Amorim could cost Man Utd around £10m with ‘the whole package’ of Amorim at Old Trafford costing between £25m and £30m.",
      "Jacobs said (via The United Stand): ‘Under the terms of his deal and having to pay Ruben Amorim for the remainder of his contract, Man United, in theory, could pay as much as just over £10 million. Including compensation to Sporting and what’s been paid in his current contract, the whole package of Ruben Amorim at Man United is likely to cost around £25-30 million.’",
      "Reddy said on X: “INEOS kept on a manager they had no faith in, openly canvassing Europe for his successor but then armed him with £200m to spend on players he wanted, and changed the backroom staff before sacking him anyway.",
      "“They axed a sporting director, whose way of working was well established, because he did not fit in with how they wanted him to work. He warned them about selecting a head coach attached to a fixed style of play, which didn’t suit the squad and how expensive it would be to build a quality 3-4-3.",
      "“They didn’t listen, insisted they believed wholeheartedly in Ruben Amorim’s approach, but then wouldn’t fully back it in the transfer market and asked him to change the tactical principles that attracted them to him. Some ‘best in class’ decision-making…”",

      "Jordan added: “He’s a brilliant manager, that’s why I’m saying Man United, get a manager like him who’s a statesman, who can build, who knows how to manage properly and doesn’t do what these children managers do every time they don’t get what they want, which is scream in front of the media.”",

      "Few will be happier with the sacking of Ruben Amorim than Amorim himself.",
      "Being dumped rarely does much for one’s self-esteem but the now ex-head coach of Manchester United carried the air of a man regretting his life choices for most of 2025. The end for Amorim probably came as sweet relief.",
      "The board won’t resent being pushed into a corner from which they could only escape by swinging the axe. Amorim taunted them to sack him and Sir Jim Ratcliffe never needs an excuse to cut employees adrift.",
      "Few of United’s stars are likely to mourn Amorim’s exit. Who among them has much to lose from it? The players’ social media lackeys will post the usual generic platitudes but most, some now on their third, fourth or even fifth United manager, probably reacted to the news with a shrug of indifference.",
      "The fans? Shoulders will shrug wearier on the Stretford End in anticipation of being told for the seventh time that it’s their job to get behind the new manager. Whoever that might be. Does it even matter anymore?",
      "Whoever takes over from Amorim has to work with a regime that is yet to prove it has the faintest idea what it’s doing. If Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and co. faced a slither of the scrutiny Amorim or his successor faces, they’d surely shrivel.",
      "Not just at United is the director of football, sporting director or CEO the cushiest gig going. All the power, almost none of the accountability. But the size of the spotlight on Old Trafford makes it all the more remarkable that those between Amorim and Ratcliffe can shimmy from scrutiny so easily in the shadows.",
      "What faith can anyone have in the United hierarchy to identify Amorim’s successor?",
      "Many of the problems they encountered with Amorim could have been foreseen before they hired him. His dogmatic faith in his formation cannot possibly have come as a surprise.",
      "It was one of the reasons they hired him. Because they, like so many others, became obsessed with the idea of a philosophy. Something to make them identifiable (synonym: predictable), perhaps a shape to build a brand on. Despite the fact the best coaches in the world all possess enough self-awareness to know that adaptability is an asset. If Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t have such a low opinion of Ratcliffe, he might be more minded to educate him on that.",
      "For that reason, the man who follows the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the Moyes, has the easiest early tap-in of all those post-Fergie managers.",
      "All Darren Fletcher need do is set United up in a formation that suits the players at his disposal. What’s your fancy, Fletch? 4-3-3? 4-2-3-1? Whichever, just please remember that you can change your mind.",
      "Amorim refused to, even if he flirted with the idea, and that will be his legacy. A decent bloke who clearly wanted to succeed and shared many of the same frustrations the fans hold. But, when push came to shove as it inevitably has, Amorim craved validation of his methods above all else.",
      "AMORIM SACKED BY MAN UTD: MORE FROM F365",
      "That defiance along with a piss-poor record means Amorim will be forgotten quicker than even some of his predecessors.",
      "And we know what comes next: Fletcher, already a United hero, will win a few games with players invigorated by a functional formation. And that’ll be nice, won’t it? Then, eventually, an ex-Blackburn winger and former academy manager of Manchester City will anoint the new manager of Manchester United.",
      "Doubtless Wilcox and his cronies will be tempted to hire another up-and-comer without the seniority to overshadow the dubious credentials of those above him. And then we’ll all meet back here in 18 months to do this all again.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United bosses have already decided their top candidate to replace the sacked Ruben Amorim, sources understand, and while they will likely have to wait before getting their hands on the man in question – Oliver Glasner – club bosses do have several other strong candidates in mind, too.",
      "News broke on Monday morning that Manchester United have dramatically sacked Amorim after just 14 months, ending a turbulent tenure marked by tactical disputes and transfer frustrations. The decision follows Amorim’s explosive post-match comments after Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Leeds United, where he demanded full managerial control and criticised the club’s recruitment team.",
      "My colleague, Graeme Bailey, revealed in the aftermath of those comments that United chiefs were left stunned by the Portuguese’s outburst and ultimately felt they had no choice but to call time on his reign.",
      "That said, the Daily Telegraph’s Sam Wallace reports that the decision to axe the 40-year-old was actually taken on Friday after an explosive meeting in which he had a major blow-up with director of football, Jason Wilcox.",
      "Amorim, appointed in November 2024, oversaw only 24 wins in 63 games, and while there had been small signs of improvement this season – notably the memorable 2-1 win at Anfield in October – he leaves United with the club labouring somewhat in sixth place in the Premier League.",
      "His insistence on a 3-4-2-1 system clashed with Wilcox’s preferences, while limited January backing exacerbated tensions. Club legend Darren Fletcher has been named interim boss ahead of Wednesday’s clash at Burnley.",
      "The search for a permanent successor is underway, with Crystal Palace’s Glasner emerging as the clear favourite. The Austrian, whose contract at Selhurst Park expires this summer, has refused to sign an extension and will be available without compensation.",
      "Glasner’s impressive record – including an FA Cup triumph and consistent mid-table finishes – has won admiration from United’s hierarchy, including CEO Omar Berrada and Wilcox.",
      "However, as our sources can reveal, there are plenty of other names in the frame…",
      "Want breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola is also high on the radar, praised by Berrada for his progressive, high-pressing style that has elevated the Cherries to a level way above their station. And despite resource constraints and their current struggles that have seen the south coast side go 10 games now without a win, sources say he would be open to a conversation and would also prefer a summer move, should an approach be made.",
      "Former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has also been added to the shortlist. The Italian, who parted ways with the Blues just days ago amid a poor run of form and similar boardroom clashes to Amorim, brings recent Premier League experience, having guided Chelsea to trophies including the Conference League and Club World Cup.",
      "Bailey has also revealed that the Italian, eager to get back into football quickly, has considerable admirers at Old Trafford with Berrada knowing him well from their time together at the Etihad.",
      "It’s understood that it is felt Maresca has the right temperament to succeed, though there are notes of caution given the way he fell out with Chelsea and with United chiefs not wanting a repeat of the Amorim fall-out themselves.",
      "Other names mentioned by our source include Gareth Southgate and Unai Emery, though there are issues with both.",
      "The obvious one with Emery, who has led Aston Villa to third in the table this season, surrounds his contract at Villa, which currently runs to 2029. Given the costs needed to pay off Amorim, understood to be around £10m with 18 months left on his deal, club chiefs would prefer to avoid another sizeable expense.",
      "Southgate, meanwhile, may be overlooked owing to INEOS’s preference for a forward-thinking coach who aligns more with their vision.",
      "Any appointment could also include a second appointment at Old Trafford too, with club bosses particularly impressed by both Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna.",
      "While neither are likely to be considered quite having the profile for the top job, they do have admirers and would be welcomed in as part of any new set-up if the new man at the helm was open to it.",
      "Sources have also indicated Xavi Hernandez would be keen for a conversation with United, though sources are yet to indicate if the former Barcelona boss is a name they would strongly consider.",
      "Either way, we understand United will sit on a decision for some time, and could delay any decision on a permanent successor towards the back end of the season.",
      "But as the Red Devils seek stability after yet another managerial upheaval, Glasner appears the standout choice for a summer overhaul.",
      "Meanwhile, three reliable journalists have shared their insight into the precise and numerous reasons why the decision was taken to axe Amorim when they did.",
      "On the transfer front, sources have told my colleague, Dean Jones, that Manchester City are now ahead of United in the race for an £85m-rated midfielder following the sacking of Amorim as the manager.",
      "United are said to be ‘crazy’ about signing a winger currently lighting up AFCON, though he will cost an extraordinary amount in transfer fees.",
      "And finally, United are ready to offload an attacker for good in the January transfer window."

      "Another promising manager falls at the wheel of Manchester United. None of the other managers similarly cast aside since Fergie left ever recovered. Moyes is probably the best of them – back near enough to the level he was before his appointment. Mourinho is utterly gone from the elite. Van Gaal was basically retired by the job. Solskjaer’s not even a manager anymore. As for Ten Hag, he’s probably in an asylum somewhere after the most embarrassing attempt at a rebound job in history at Leverkusen.",
      "The players fare little better with promising stars like Sancho basically having their careers stop dead the second they pull on the jersey. Bruno Fernandes is basically Sisyphus – vainly pushing the club up the hill for all eternity only for it roll back down every time.",
      "David de Gea once famously said the club was cursed. Maybe he was joking but I’m not. I wrote in previously about how what Utd needed was a Shaman rather than a manager, an exorcism rather than a gameplan. Liverpool achieved this in 2015 when they finally cast off years of failure and banter to become a serious club again via the alchemy of Jurgen Klopp. Man Utd are in that position now. This isn’t about football anymore. It’s spiritual. They need to save their soul. Forget tactics and formations. Find a magic man, a Messiah who can lift the curse and purge their demons.",
      "Only one man on the market (other than Klopp) has ever done something like this. He brought the English national team back to a major final after decades in the wilderness. Even more miraculous was his lifting of the penalty shootout curse that guaranteed England’s exit from major tournaments up to that point.",
      "Southgate isn’t the manager to bring Utd back to the summit of football. But he is the man to wipe them clean, to placate whatever gods they have offended and then to hand them over to a manager who can, finally, start with a fresh slate like Tuchel with England.",

      "The sacking of Ruben Amorim highlights the total absurdity of the corporate mindset currently running Manchester United, regardless of whether your think Amorim is a good or bad manager, he was destined to fail.",
      "​Amorim was honest from the start. He was clear about his system and his identity. To hire him and then act surprised when he doesn’t want to play a 4-3-3 is like hiring a specialist and then being annoyed when they do exactly what is on their CV.",
      "​The real story here is the internal self-preservation. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox have spent months covering themselves by briefing about “predictable” tactics. They’ve essentially set up a “win-win” for their own job security: if Amorim fails, they say they warned him; if he changes and fails, they say he couldn’t coach the transition.",
      "​Look at Marco Silva. He didn’t even beat United in August, but he gave a clinical interview highlighting his tactical plan against the 3-4-3. This was immediately hijacked by the corporate people at United to claim the manager was “predictable.”",
      "For Vivell to then admit he bought players for a “modern dynamic system” at odds with what the manager uses is indicative of massive corporate overreach. It is people in offices thinking they understand every role better than the specialist they hired.",
      "​United are chasing a 4-3-3 template that isn’t even the modern system anymore—it’s an old idea they’ve rebranded as progress while the elite clubs have already moved on to positional fluidity. Real modern coaching is about the fluidity seen at City, Madrid, or Leverkusen, where fixed formations are replaced by “rotations”—centre-backs stepping into midfield and wingers becoming interior tens to create overloads.",
      "​While the best move toward being “unmarkable” through movement, United are still obsessed with the rigid lines of a 2019 system.",
      "They ignored the red flags Liverpool saw because they wanted a system manager, then spent months trying to strip away the very things that made him successful. It’s another manager chewed up by a club where the executives are more concerned with their own narratives than building a football team.",
      "As a Gillingham fan I’m not to fussed who they choose next to fail, but as accountability goes, there will be none and Utd will continue to lurch forwards to mediocrity.\nKif, Aldershot",

      "Anyway, the big challenge now is who comes in and the question is how do INEOS mess it up.",
      "If it was my money on the line, and I was making the selection, there’s three groups:\n– former United players (Ole, Carrick, Keane, Ruud)\n– PL managers (Iraola, Glasner etc)\n– big names from abroad (Xavi etc)",
      "I would suggest the squad needs some uplift and the fans need to see some Unitedness returned, so probably a caretaker for the rest of the season. But we know how that can end up becoming permanent (although only if they do well, and what more can you ask?).",
      "Asking a manager to come in half way can be a great chance to establish things but also there’s no time to get to know the club and, if they don’t align with the squad, we’ve seen (twice, with Rangnick) how bad it can go. Tricky.",
      "A big name is no sure thing. A former player may lack experience and/or ability.",
      "Based on our new approach to player signings, my guess is a PL manager is most likely, but will any want to leave half way?",
      "For me, I’d be picking between Carrick, Iraola (Glasner just made a big signing so I can’t see him leaving now, while Semenyo is off) and Xavi.",

      "What a great start to the year it has just become, thanks to my lot (Manchester United) finally getting rid of their worst manager in living memory. Some of the immediate discussions in the WhatsApp groups (hey, it’s the first Monday back at work – everyone’s looking for something else to do) were whether Amorim should’ve been given more time, based on United’s history of chopping and changing managers too swiftly.",
      "My opinion is that he was lucky to have lasted this long. I agree that managers, if they show signs of progress, should be shown some patience and allowed to develop the team and a playing style. But come on – anyone who’s watched United play in recent months will know how bad it’s been. The few lucky, narrow wins we’ve had have mostly involved clinging on for dear life (such as the recent Newcastle game, or at Anfield against what we now know to be a pretty hit-and-miss Liverpool) or against ten men. Failing to create any real chances against a ten-man Everton (who have just conceded four to Brentford) over the course of 80 minutes was akin to psychological torture. And there’s been no sign, more than a year in, that anything was going to improve. 17 points off the top, 17 points from relegation. Nobody’s asking for a title challenge, but ‘meh’ isn’t what anyone wants after investing so much in the squad.",
      "I watch an episode of Frasier each weekday morning with breakfast (my wife’s idea, started many years ago when she gave up on the news) and in the current cycle, we’re at the point where Frasier becomes increasingly desperate regarding his love life – even more so than usual – and starts dating god-awful colleague Julia, trying to convince himself that there’s some good in her somewhere. Despite all the evidence, he gives her lots of leeway and makes excuses for her, worried about giving up on her too quickly. After she’s unapologetically offended everyone else, he only finally breaks up with her after she insults his new Italian hand towels. Amorim was United’s Julia – a totally unsuitable choice, who was given too much time to prove this.",

      "So now we add Ruby to the scrap heap of post-Fergie Utd managers. 3 points off top 4 and playing the best attacking football we have in years (statistically anyway) even though he only had one summer transfer window. Not to mention fantastic results against Liverpool, Chelsea and City (last season).",
      "Terrible decision and terrible timing. Should at least have given him until the end of the season. Hounded out again by a narrative driven by ignorance and a belief that this is still 90s/00s “Manchester United we are talking about”. I despair.",

      "READ: Jason Wilcox is absurdly one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "",
      "So basically, Ruben has told Wilcox and Co to f off and also if they have the b..ls to sack him. It was evident that things were already downhill between the manager and the board. But this seems the final straw and only an unbelievable U-turn of stance and ego will keep him in his job.",
      "While the general consensus is that Utd have improved this season and slightly better on the points table, problems of formation, set-up and tactics have persisted. Also he’s been inconsistent in his in-game changes and substitutions. Even yesterday against Leeds, he didn’t make changes bar one because he simply didn’t have CBs or other defenders to bring in. They were all in the playing XI.",
      "Also while our form as compared to last season seems better, we need to understand that this is one hell of a PL table wherein with a couple of bad results Utd could go below tenth in the standings. And with the upcoming games against City and Arsenal, it is rather uncomfortable for us to be in bad form and shape heading into those matches.",
      "We are missing 4 key players from the starting XI and also 4 other players who have featured regularly from the bench. Any team with so many players missing is bound to suffer and especially when quality from the squad is lagging, this was bound to happen. Yes, we are unsure of bringing in new players and additions to the squad but only time will tell on where we are headed in that regard.",
      "But Ruben should also help himself by adapting to the situation and rather be versatile in his team selection and tactics. Why bring on Josh only after Leeds score? Why not look at the bigger picture and go for it in the games against teams down in the bottom half? These dropped points will definitely not help him in the long run.",
      "All said and done, now is not the time to look for a new manager and especially with what happened last season after the change mid-season, I’m not sure how it is going to help the club achieve our ambitions and objectives. With our main players expected to come back and also the team showing better resilience than earlier it is time to stick to Amorim and everyone at the club stick together and show determination not only on the field and also off it as well.\nVasanthan (Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India).",

The Europa league win was glorious but 17th in the table is grim… Something had to change. And that change was Thomas Frank.",
      "With my logical hat on, I said this would work. We’d become a solid, sensible team, adapting to each game and opposition, tighten up at the back, and actually appreciate set pieces. Back to 5th we’d go!",
      "But look at us now. One position worse off than this time last year – with no Europa League salvation on the horizon.",
      "I’m generally the one who says managers should get patience: But that patience has got to be based on something. Some sign that there is something to be built, even if that process will take time.",
      "Unfortunately with Frank, right now, I can’t see it.",
      "And unfortunately this leads me back to a very unhelpful conclusion: I should have stuck with my heart, not my head: Spurs should’ve kept Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Tactics, signings, formations, set pieces. They’re all very important factors of football, but none of these are as important as belief. Teams that believe they are winning teams, and play with that confidence… tend to be the ones that win. Look at Arsenal, as much as it pains me to say. Arteta’s biggest achievement so far has changing the culture of that team to think of themselves as *winners*. Yes, you can mock them for not getting over the line, but you can’t deny the culture change over the past few years.",
      "Ange came to Spurs, and for better or worse, he said Spurs won’t be bridesmaids any more. No more shrinking back – Spurs were going to win, and they were going to do it playing attacking, exciting football. Yes, it went wrong plenty of times… but when it worked it was glorious. And yes, by the end, much of ‘Angeball’ had disappeared… but he still turned that Spurs team into winners for the first time in 20 years. Even lately, players like Micky Van de Ven have spoken highly about the belief Ange instilled in the team.",
      "Thomas Frank, he seems like a good manager and a great guy… but I don’t see the same belief in those Spurs players. Right now, those Spurs players don’t know what they are – and they are playing like a team with no identity. They’re a rudderless ship, moving from one dull 1-1 to the next.",
      "With Ange, even in the dark times, there were enough bright spots that you could see the possible bright future. With the current Spurs team… I just don’t know.",

      "I feel I must slightly disagree with Minty’s post from the morning.",
      "Whilst I do agree that the football has been awful recently, I also feel that Slot has been rather hamstrung by the decisions made above him. I am of course referring to the wonderfully quaffed and stylishly stubbled, Richard Hughes.",
      "Minty asks, why does Slot always seem to play Gakpo. It is quite simple, it is because Diaz was sold, and no replacement (shy of a 17YO) was identified. Last year, Diaz was the release valve, a player capable of direct running at pace, either from the left or central, but he was able to move the ball up the pitch quickly. Gakpo isn’t that player. Ekitike might be, but he is only half a season into his LFC career.",
      "Nunez was capable of the same, but he was also not replaced. Isak, I am sure will be a success, but he is more of a poacher and not as creative, direct or robust on the ball as Diaz or Nunez.",
      "Couple this with the tragic loss of Jota, again another direct player, and Harvey Elliott going, we lost four attackers and replaced them with two stylistically different players.",
      "Add into the mix Salah’s strange drop off, something that I am sure no one expected to be this dramatic, and you have the perfect storm of shiteness we are sitting through each week",
      "We all remember the trident of Mane, Firmino and Salah in their pomp. They were an indestructible force of pressing, creativity and scoring. However, I am sure that, that level of 3 players playing for one team is a generational thing. AFCON aside, I don’t really remember Mane and Salah missing too many games.",
      "Wirtz, again, I feel, will be a success, as he is now scoring and creating. But without a settled team, how is he able to understand and link with those players around him? This team is building the plane as they are flying it.",
      "And this leads me back to my starting point. The executives, who make decisions, appear to be coated with Teflon in these matters. Hughes at Liverpool, Wilcox and Man U and the 5 Sporting directors at Chelsea make the signings and agree sales and say to the coach, make a team play. However, buying the hot new thing does not guarantee success. Liverpool bought Robertson, Gini W and Shaqiri from relegated teams, and they turned out alright.",
      "I remember Rafa Benitez saying of the directors when he was at Valencia (winning titles), “I asked for a table and they bought me a lamp”.",
      "I am sure that Slot did not want Diaz to go – recent subtle leaks confirm this – so whilst I do hold him responsible for some of this concerning drop-off, I think that others hold equal, if not more, responsibility and need to look at their own actions before considering swinging the axe.",

      "Can we all just take a moment to fully acknowledge that Jason Wilcox becoming one of the most powerful men in English football is really bloody strange?",
      "We’re not having a go. We’re not even saying it’s wrong, although our gut feeling is that Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s five bullet-point list of demands for and impositions upon any new Man United manager, which were written up pre-Amorim but will presumably be similarly forced on his successor, was a(nother) needlessly restrictive self-limiting and self-defeating bit of willy-waving.",
      "At first glance, it appeared to be the latest piece of evidence that inside every ferociously intelligent and wildly successful businessman there is a really, really stupid and petty idiot desperately trying to get out. Things have calmed a little since but every leaked email about untidy desks and pronouncement about resignations from the new United regime set alarm bells ringing initially.",
      "And while we don’t doubt Sir Jim’s business success it did seem worth noting that his forays into sport are not uniformly successful; Team Sky dominated professional cycling for a decade and you don’t hear so much about them since INEOS took over, do you?",
      "It might all prove to be genius, of course. Maybe applying the Leonardo Di Caprio Girlfriend Principle to the purchasing of professional footballers is a great idea and nobody else had the big brilliant brain to come up with it refusing to sign anyone over 25.",
      "But we’re getting off the point. And that’s the fact that those five unbreakable rules at Old Trafford are inextricably tied to one man, who ultimately made the call to sack Amorim after a communication ‘breakdown’.",
      "Amorim’s decision to publicly call out “the sporting director” as one of those who “needs to do their job” was pointed, and enough for Jason Wilcox to, hours later, feel the need to sack a coach who ‘blew up’ during a ‘positive’ meeting the prior week over his beloved 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Wilcox felt Amorim had not evolved his approach enough, and was empowered to dispense with Amorim as the man charged with dictating the playing style for all levels of Manchester United from youth to first team.",
      "Step back a little, and that is pretty wild, no? Wilcox has done excellent work at Manchester City and Southampton and, again, we’re not saying he doesn’t deserve this chance or even that it won’t eventually work.",
      "It’s just the sheer amount of power and control that now rests with a figure who exists behind the scenes and out of the limelight that feels so difficult to square.",
      "It’s not new and it undoubtedly reflects on a media-led obsession with the personalities and main character energy provided by managers.",
      "But we still marvel at the fact that at no point since he was a solid if forgettable Blackburn winger in the 90s has there ever been any sense of any narrative that ‘Ah yes, there’s a man destined to become one of the most powerful and influential figures at Manchester United without ever being a first-team manager anywhere at all along the way’.",
      "That lack of management experience or success is the thing, isn’t it? While he’s been grafting away and building his career, we’d hazard that you, like us, had given him barely a second’s thought unless he happened to pop up whipping in a cross for Chris Sutton on Premier League Years. And again, it’s on us and the media framing of who’s important. That’s what’s wrong here, not Wilcox and very possibly not even Manchester United, hard as that is to accept.",
      "In the same way that you don’t need to have been a great player to be a great manager, why would you need to be a great manager to be a great sporting director? They’re different jobs.",
      "But we’re still conditioned to see the first-team manager as the most important single footballing figure at a club. The temptation here is still to shake our heads and go ‘What would Fergie make of being told his style of play is set by a former Blackburn winger who’s never been a manager, eh?’",
      "But things have changed. There’s an old saying in journalism: to reporters the glory, to sub-editors the power.",
      "The idea is that while it’s reporters who get their name in the paper and get the attention, it’s the subs who control the overall product. Senior editorial roles were far more commonly recruited from the subs’ desk than the reporters’ pen.",
      "There’s a bit of that here. Not in journalism, not anymore; the industry f***ed subs off as an unnecessary luxury once bosses realised that nobody actually cares if a newspaper is good as long as it reassuringly confirms all their existing biases and fears every morning. But it still holds true in football’s current direction of travel.",
      "Your Wilcoxes and the Dougie Freedmans of this world will never get the attention that managers get – nor are they expected to face the cameras and questions a fraction as often – but they are increasingly the people holding the levers of power.",
      "READ NEXT: Who will be the next Man Utd manager after Ruben Amorim sacking?",

      "A United chief said the club want to make the ‘right’ signings after an improved showing of form in the league.",

      "READ: Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "He added: ‘Wilcox had intended the meeting to be a positive look at the evolution of the team but when the system was raised – Amorim’s go-to 3-4-3 formation – the Portuguese coach “blew up”, according to sources.’",
      "Before Wallace continued: ‘The feeling at the club was that as soon as Amorim found himself under pressure he went back to his favoured system – whether it was suitable or not for the opposition. His angry reaction to Wilcox’s observations indicated to the club hierarchy that he had taken United as far as he could. ‘",
      "The Athletic journalist Oliver Kay has criticised INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe for continuing the “muddled” approach associated with the previous decision-makers.",

      "“It’s been more of the same. Reactive. Slow to spot trends. Making appointments without really appearing to know what they’re doing.",
      "“To suddenly be questioning internally the Amorim strategy rather than just results… They seemed to accept his formation, his adherence to a three-man central defence for most of the past 14 months.",

      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. So we’ve come up with 20 reasons why they have finally parted ways with Ruben Amorim…",
      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it ages ago if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintained, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it was not the system that was the problem. This is despite the clear recent evidence suggesting otherwise.",
      "Performances did slightly improve as Amorim made tweaks to cope with injuries, but Man Utd went backwards again before his demise as he reverted to his ineffective formation.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably saw a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats were far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager after Ruben Amorim sacking?",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That was not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles were? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",
      "",
      "Of the ever-present Premier League teams since Amorim’s appointment, only Spurs, West Ham United and Wolves have a lesser total…",
      "",
      "Like a p*ssed up bloke down the pub going nose to nose with you looking for any excuse for a rumble, he’s f***ing asked for it.",
      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continued to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed, but he opted to stick around for his £12m compensation.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirety of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates were ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker was “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too was Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in September’s defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim felt he was “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must have been similarly confused as to why he’s not played in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He was told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It was not a good look.",
      "",
      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably have been out of the job earlier if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses were too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we could not fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "",
      "Some reports suggest sacking Amorim is going to cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund now has 12 goal involvements in 21 games.",
      "He has showcased that he is a Proper Striker this season, with the Napoli loanee producing finishes that many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from him when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim made life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he came up against as they knew exactly how United were going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is also in the running favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim had United playing was so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club are no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at a possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there were plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day…",
      "",
      "Amorim was an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if it was not for Amorim, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, contributing a stunning total of eleven goals and seven assists.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim, they made another in not sacking him for so long.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported in September that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea would have outweighed a Brentford defeat (and subsequent lows) in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they have been over the past 14 months. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January or the summer and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim was not solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really was no one more to blame for this mess. He has been a “disaster”.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "Seven pundits, including Rio Ferdinand, have reacted to Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim, with two standout replacements named…",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim issued a ‘sack’ ultimatum to INEOS before being dismissed, while Manchester United could make a January signing.",
      "Reliable journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed that the true cost of the “whole package of Ruben Amorim at Man Utd” is around £25-30m.",
      "Ruben Amorim had to go. But little will change while the powerbrokers at Manchester United fear hiring a manager who might highlight their own shortcomings…",
      "Ruben Amorim is “not surprised” by his Man Utd sacking and felt that the Red Devils “needed one or two experienced signings this window”."

      "After buying his stake in Manchester United almost two years ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted he and his INEOS team had “made a lot of cock-ups” in his other footballing ventures, Lausanne and Nice, presumably in a bid to convince the Red Devils fans that they had learned lessons from those mistakes that would not be repeated at Old Trafford.",
      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest – and worst – post-Ferguson Manchester United manager to be sacked, seemingly for slightly challenging Jason Wilcox and the board rather than sustained underperformance on the training ground and pitch.",
      "In their official statement on Amorim’s departure, it was said only that ‘the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.’",
      "There are no quotes from Ratcliffe, Wilcox or Omar Berrada. Those might come soon. But also going by their track record of only really speaking when results are on the up, perhaps not.",
      "In any event, those who made the call to appoint Amorim and have ultimately swung the axe on him ought to be held accountable for that and myriad other questionable strategic calls and ill-advised comments in interviews that are among the mistakes we’ve listed here, including some that the Ratcliffe advocates will claim weren’t his decisions, but – despite his clear ethos of passing it wherever possible – the buck stops with him.",
      "Anyway, strap yourselves in: Ratcliffe’s mistakes ranked from minor to major.",
      "",
      "It doesn’t seem all that unreasonable for a struggling organisation not to hand out £100 Christmas bonuses and instead give members of staff a £40 M&S voucher, and the employees themselves may well have been fine had it been explained to them properly and hadn’t been part of a widespread cost-cutting scheme that’s seen many of their friends and colleagues made redundant while what we assume is now half-ply loo paper is on hand the toilets.",
      "“At least the Glazers prioritised families,” said one staffer. “And anuses,” said another, probably.",
      "",
      "We suspect the Manchester United fans were delighted to hear about Ratcliffe and Ineos’ plan to conduct a ‘thorough strategic review’ of the football club when the British billionaire took charge of all football operations. After years of Glazer family negligence, on and off the pitch, it was necessary.",
      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £12bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",

      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper is weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield or that Casemiro still has it in him. They also know, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "They are quite clearly f***ed and will continue to get f***ed without one. And we know Ratcliffe probably isn’t involved in transfer strategy, but a huge fan as he purports to be, with the chequebook in hand, should be insisting on a midfielder as the priority. Don’t have another £100m? Fine. Don’t use all of your cash on three forwards. Absolute madness.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must have spent the subsequent 14 months p*ssing himself as that disruption continued unabated until and beyond the Portuguese manager’s demise.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation and games coming thick as well as fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’. Boy are they regretting that now.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim has, and that it cannot counter well over a year of underperformance, even with hundreds of millions spent.",
      "Amorim told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, both parties would definitely choose the latter.",
      "But ultimately the failure of Amorim can be tracked back to Ratcliffe and his peers in the boardroom. They rushed through appointing him in November 2024 and sacked him in January 2026, spending pretty much every intervening second trying to convince themselves publicly and privately that they had cracked it while actually writing off at least a couple of seasons and likely far more considering how so many of their decisions on the playing squad alone were inextricably tied to suiting the ideals of an obstinate head coach who is no longer there.",
      "Add it to the extensive personal list of Ratcliffe’s football ownership “cock-ups”. Someone get him a copy of Football Manager so he can get all this out of his system.",

      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",

      "Manchester United sack Ruben Amorim in wake of rising tension at Old Trafford; Amorim dismissed after meeting with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox; Darren Fletcher to take charge of United for Wednesday's game at Burnley; Amorim departs after 14 months in charge",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 21:42, UK",
      "Manchester United have sacked head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim was subsequently dismissed following a Monday morning meeting with Wilcox and Omar Berrada, United's chief executive.",
      "United are understood to have concluded that Amorim's position had become untenable.",
      "Neville said that he was \"stunned\" that during the course of Amorim's reign, Man Utd continued to play so poorly in his back-three system. \"That's a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.\"",
      "He has called on Man Utd to now seek out a replacement who can play in the traditional style of the club.",
      "\"The experiments have got to stop. Man Utd have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "Amorim sacked - more reading and in-depth analysis:",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, is understood to feel he was not getting the backing of the club hierarchy and is frustrated by what has happened.",
      "The repeated use of the word \"manager\" in his final news conference was significant.",
      "Amorim accepts that the results were not good enough and acknowledges that he had the worst win rate of any manager at United since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "But he also felt confident that he could achieve Champions League football this season if he remained in charge and that their form would improve with the return of players from Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "Amorim felt United needed one or two experienced signings this January transfer window, in particular an experienced Premier League striker.",
      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",
      "Amorim felt that if he were given more resources now, that would guarantee Champions League football and even bigger financial returns. United's hierarchy have always been adamant they would not take that risk and will shun any return to short-term transfer decisions.",
      "Amorim has told friends he struggled to cope with the noise from outside the club, which he feels undermined the job he was doing.",
      "Whilst he is adamant that the job wasn't too big for him, he was surprised by how political and difficult the role is at Manchester United, and feels it is an impossible job to prepare fully for, because no one understands the unique challenges until they are in place at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese coach feels he had less and less input into footballing decisions as time went on. Whilst he feels he always tried to be true to himself, he accepts that his often emotional response in front of the media was to his detriment.",
      "Amorim departs after 14 months in charge, with his final game the 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's dismissal was announced by Man Utd shortly after 10am on Monday.",
      "In a statement, United confirmed \"the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Man Utd then return to Old Trafford on Sunday for an FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton.",
      "Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract, which was due to expire in June 2027.",
      "But in an apparent pointed message to the Old Trafford hierarchy following Sunday's draw at Leeds, he said he saw himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\"",
      "That outburst followed cryptic suggestions to the media just before Christmas that he had not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three for the dismal 1-1 draw against Wolves.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card.",
      "These are the contests that shape relegation battles. It's going to be ugly and full of tension. And one you won't want to miss.",
      "West Ham's Nuno Espírito Santo versus Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche is a matchup that doesn't exactly scream 'bring your popcorn'. When these two managers have crossed paths across their careers, goals have been at a premium. That is the betting angle here. Across nine previous meetings, there have been just 19 goals in total, with seven of those games finishing under 2.5 goals.",
      "The managerial matchup here, when added to the likely cup final nature, quietly points toward another low-scoring chapter in the Nuno vs Dyche playbook. The 10/11 with Sky Bet for under 2.5 goals is the obvious play.",
      "Cristian Romero likes to defend in a manner that can quickly tip over from assertive to reckless. It's why referees know his name. Eight yellow cards and a red already this season tells its own story.",
      "Bournemouth are very good at inviting chaos that leads to cards. Andoni Iraola's side want to play quickly, get the ball into feet between the lines and force centre-backs to make decisions they don't want to make. That's where Evanilson comes in - a striker who is a genuine card magnet.",
      "Since the start of last season he's drawn 21 cards from opponents - only Bruno Guimarães has drawn more.",
      "Romero is 2/1 with Sky Bet to be carded. It's a bet.",
      "Robin Roefs has been nothing short of sensational since his £11.5m move from NEC Nijmegen in August. Seven clean sheets bagged already this season, including three in the last five games, tells the story. His save ratio of 78.4 per cent is the best in the league.",
      "Roefs leads all goalkeepers for xG prevented at +4.9, meaning he's conceded almost five goals fewer than expected and only Martin Dubravka has made more saves this season (70). Away from home across his last nine games, he's averaging 4.3 saves per 90 where those backing his 4+ saves line have landed the money in seven of those games.",
      "Brentford arrive in great nick, having taken 10 points and scored 10 goals in their last four games, and are turning games into ones where the opposition goalkeeper is constantly called into action. Roefs to make four or more saves at 10/11 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "This fixture is all about the dugout dynamic.",
      "Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner seem to know exactly how to play Aston Villa and Unai Emery. The record is startling. Palace are unbeaten in the last six meetings, winning five of them, with an aggregate score of 19-4. Pure domination.",
      "And when patterns like that persist across different game states, venues and moments in the season, it's fair to declare that Glasner has Emery's number. It's a system Villa have repeatedly struggled to solve. Every time they try to step on Palace, they get pulled into transitional chaos, exactly where Glasner's side thrive.",
      "At Selhurst Park, with Palace's recent dominance in this fixture and a manager who repeatedly outmanoeuvres his opposite number, the fact Palace are the outsiders at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy angle to attack.",
      "Defensively, Wolves look transformed.",
      "Across their last five Premier League matches, Wolves have posted an expected goals against figure of just 1.01 per 90 - it's the second-best defensive record in the league over that sample size. And context elevates it further. This run includes games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool - fixtures that usually inflate defensive numbers rather than squeeze them. West Ham found that out on Saturday.",
      "They were restricted to scraps in terms of attacking return while for the first time this season the Wolves attack found a ruthless streak in the 3-0 win. Similar results may follow in recent weeks.",
      "Everton could struggle to find a way through making the double chance option on the away win a bet to play at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Whether it's Joao Pedro dropping in and rolling defenders or Liam Delap playing on the shoulder and inviting contact, Chelsea's forwards are excellent at turning physical battles into card parties. Fouls get drawn. And cards tend to follow.",
      "Eight centre-backs have been carded against Chelsea in their last 15 games, so Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca could be walking into a proper examination here.",
      "Cuenca's recent record suggests he's not immune to catching the referee's eye. He's been booked in two of his last four games and historically he carries a fairly punchy card profile. A 0.28 cards-per-90 ratio from his time in La Liga tells you he's a defender who plays on the front foot, happy to engage early rather than drop off. The 7/2 with Sky Bet for a Cuenca card has a chance.",
      "Brighton are not your average mid-table Premier League team when visiting the elite, and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shot bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 12 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under Fabian Hurzerler's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 14.5 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.5 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output and one which deserves full respect in this fixture where City could be without their first-choice defensive duo in Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.",
      "The markets are behind on this shots curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet - something they have landed in their last three head-to-heads with Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore.",
      "Newcastle have scored at least twice in each of their last 11 home matches. That attacking consistency was on show again last time out when they delivered exactly what was expected by this column against Crystal Palace, where the 10/11 for a home win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals landed. No need to change a winning formula then.",
      "Expect goals, expect control and expect Newcastle to deliver in front of their own fans yet again. The 4/5 on offer through the Sky Bet BuildABet function for Newcastle to win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals remains a bet to follow.",
      "According to the Premier League title-winning odds, it's never been more likely this season than now that Arsenal will land the outright prize. After Chelsea's late salvo at Manchester City, the 1/4 on offer with Sky Bet on Arsenal for the title is the shortest price they've been all season. Only Arsenal can stop Arsenal now.",
      "For this game the under 2.5 goals line is worth a look at 11/10 with Sky Bet. Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot are cut from a similar cloth. Territory matters. Risk management matters. Neither wants a basketball match",
      "When two managers are this obsessed with control, the game often eats itself. In big games between elite managers of this nature, it often promises drama and delivers tension instead. One goal either way could be enough.",

      "The decision to sack Ruben Amorim became inevitable once the Portuguese coach made it clear this was no long-term project but the unravelling of his Manchester United reign damns the decision-makers as well as the coach, writes Adam Bate",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 14:15, UK",
      "The end of yet another error. Manchester United’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim midway through the season leaves the club in rebuild mode for a second consecutive campaign, their commitment to this latest project unceremoniously abandoned.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe had boldly claimed that Amorim was doing a great job. Omar Berrada, the club's chief executive, argued that come the summer the worst would be behind them. As both are belatedly learning, things can always get worse at United.",
      "August brought defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in their history, Amorim unable to watch as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby. Fiddling with his tactics board that night, he became the face that launched 1,000 memes.",
      "September brought defeat at Brentford, a game which ended with Amorim repeating his experiment of playing Mason Mount at left wing-back. Only October brought some relief, an unexpected win over Liverpool at Anfield and the manager of the month award.",
      "But, in November, they were beaten by Everton at Old Trafford, losing a Premier League home game against 10 men for the first time. In December, they somehow contrived to allow a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches to leave with a point.",
      "It ends in January after a draw at Leeds, conceding in 15 consecutive away games for the first time in Premier League history. Not because of that result but because the relationship between Amorim and those above him had become broken beyond repair.",
      "The realisation of how much work remained was a source of tension. Amorim had been given a new £200m forward line but still wanted more there and in almost every other area of the pitch. His demands came from a weak position as faith in him faded.",
      "Berrada talked of a \"very clear identity\" but even that was being compromised by the end. Having moved on his wingers, he finally switched to a back four - inexplicably suggesting the reason he had not made the change earlier was because of the media.",
      "Even then, after limping to victory over Newcastle in that system, he reverted back and failed to beat Wolves. Gary Neville was frustrated. That Amorim name-checked him after his final game in charge suggests those frustrations were shared within the club.",
      "United's decision-makers will be criticised for this folly and rightly so. The award of a new contract to Erik ten Hag only to sack him in October of last season did not present the best conditions for Amorim to take the job - something he was acutely aware of.",
      "It always came with risk. Liverpool opted against Amorim because of the incompatibility of his formation, going with the greater continuity afforded by appointing Arne Slot and being rewarded with the Premier League title. But Amorim was on their radar.",
      "His reputation had been well earned, having had nothing but success at Portugal, building the best Sporting side for a generation, a first title in 19 years. And there were very good reasons why United were more amenable to change than Liverpool.",
      "Having finished outside the top seven under Ten Hag, there was an appetite among supporters for something more than mere evolution and Ratcliffe was happy to sell that idea. He wanted to disrupt things at Old Trafford and Amorim could be his instrument.",
      "But few could have anticipated it being quite so fraught.",
      "Amorim was afforded extraordinary levels of patience and Ten Hag's own struggles only partially explain it. The Portuguese picked up fewer points in his first six games than the Dutchman had mustered in his last six - and things actually got worse from there.",
      "Amorim averaged a point a game last season across 27 matches, putting them 16th in the table during that period - which is where they finished. Worth a reminder, perhaps, that while United were meandering when he arrived, they were only four points off third.",
      "Failing to qualify for Europe changed the financial picture, slowing the pace of change and making it more difficult for Amorim to overhaul the squad. Although, his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo had some fans questioning his plans for it anyway.",
      "There were grumbles when he refused to change shape when chasing games, making like-for-like substitutions in the devastating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The familiar sight of swapping centre-backs late on bewildered many at Old Trafford.",
      "And yet, United's match-going supporters are a loyal bunch and few will be celebrating his exit. They had hoped against hope that this would work after more than a decade of disappointments. They were willing to trust that all this was actually going somewhere.",
      "It is why, for all his failings, Amorim was undone by his comments as much as the results. Speaking about his relationship with the club in that press room in Leeds, he concluded: \"[It] is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on.\"",
      "That laid bare to everyone the fact that this new path that Amorim was on was not leading to a new era, the next United dynasty. In his own words, even if the club were to let him to see out his deal, this project was already nearer to the end than the beginning.",
      "Framed in that context, it was only natural to question the point in proceeding down said path. And so, having tried the big characters, the club heroes, United's investment in this tactical bright young thing has been aborted too. The end of yet another error.",

      "There was an awful lot of optimism when he first joined - both from the Manchester United bosses and from supporters.",
      "But in truth, he never seemed comfortable in the job.",
      "The United hierarchy were desperate to give him a full season in charge before judging him - partly because of the cost of sacking him, which will now be £12m, but also because of the recurring instability that inevitably happens if you regularly change the man at the top.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, Amorim was the 10th manager to be appointed. But results were so poor, they never afforded the club's bosses, or Amorim, the luxury of time.",
      "Despite spending over £200m on attacking talent in the summer, despite the Portuguese coach having a full pre-season to get his message across, despite many of the statistics pointing to improved performance levels from the team, despite the man himself coping well with the media scrutiny and being well-liked across the board at the club…the results were awful.",
      "Amorim is a decent, honest, hard-working guy. But he had to go.Rob Dorsett",
      "Stubbornness forms the very basis of where many fans will feel Amorim got it wrong. But could the Portuguese head coach's downfall be pinned on a specific decision? Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United goes without saying.",
      "His 100 goals for the club tell a story of the level of consistency and performance he's displayed since arriving at Old Trafford nearly six years ago.",
      "Ask anyone who United's best player is and the majority will reply with Fernandes. However, in the summer, there was an opportunity to move away from him.",
      "Rightly or wrongly, representative of an era at United, Fernandes had an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, which would have seen United potentially make £100m from his departure. That money could have been reinvested to plug United's overstated midfield holes.",
      "Instead, the player became a symbol of Amorim's hard-headed approach. Amorim's insistence on deploying him as one of his two midfielders has hampered United.",
      "As captain, Fernandes is Amorim's go-to in midfield and for the former Sporting coach, he contended for the position with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "That's a scenario that has seen the England international and a favourite among fans find minutes hard to come by, which hasn't helped Amorim's case with the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "Stubborn by nature, Amorim would tell you he'd make the same decision to keep Fernandes, knowing what would ultimately be his fate. However, it is now clear that Fernandes was the catalyst for Amorim's United demise.William Bitibiri",
      "Amorim has had an uphill task since day one - and that is down to Manchester United's dithering over Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman looked set to leave after salvaging an FA Cup win at the end of a disappointing 2023/24 season. It was a chance for him to leave on a high and for the club to move on. But instead, after sounding out various alternatives, United decided they could find no better option, so handed Ten Hag a contract extension - and a heap of money in the transfer window.",
      "He was also given a say on who to bring in. \"He did have a voice, which is why there were one or two Dutch players,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe memorably said. Players Ten Hag had coached at former clubs were also added to the squad.",
      "In summer 2024, Man Utd signed Netherlands internationals Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee, along with Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui - who played for Erik ten Hag at Ajax - and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Nine games into the new 2024/25 season, the United decision-makers changed their mind again and sacked him before installing Amorim.",
      "A new manager in a new league, trying to implement a new system with players signed for a different manager… what could go wrong?",
      "It now looks like folly not to have given Amorim a full pre-season and transfer window in the summer of 2024 to shift the style of play and approach at the club. The good feeling from the FA Cup win could have provided a welcome launch pad.",
      "\"It was the wrong decision,\" Ratcliffe concluded about the whole Ten Hag mess.",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment, there were reports he would have preferred to have waited until the end of the season before leaving Sporting for United. If he had been given a full run-in to his first campaign, the transition could have been a whole lot smoother and successful.Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United scored just 44 league goals in 2024/25 - their lowest recorded total since 1973/74, when they were relegated from the First Division - so this summer was about putting a new forward line and in came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "An impressive triple capture, and one that cost £207.2m. It represented a huge outlay for a club without European football, but illustrated just how keen they are to ensure the absence from Europe lasted one season and one season only.",
      "But how costly was it that the midfield was, on the face of it, not treated with the same urgency? Amorim did not sign a single midfielder during his time in charge.",
      "Fernandes is one of the first names on the team sheet, and rightly so, but the options for partners are limited.",
      "It is a similar story in goal. Andre Onana played only three of the last seven league games last year before being loaned out to Trabzonspor. Amorim initially persisted with Altay Bayindir despite the £18.2m arrival of Senne Lammens. Eyebrows were raised with the signing of Lammens, with just 54 league appearances to his name, but he has been United's No 1 since October.",
      "One problem area has been remedied, but a lack of similar work elsewhere has played its part.Dan Long",
      "Amorim, INEOS, the Manchester United squad - nobody comes out of this mess looking good. But spare a thought for 3-4-3.",
      "The mere mention of the formation is likely to induce cold sweats among United fans. The depths their side have plumbed in a bid to get to grips with the system have been so low that some pundits have insisted it can never work in the Premier League.",
      "But that isn't true. Chelsea won the Premier League in 2017 playing 3-4-3. Crystal Palace have enjoyed remarkable success under Oliver Glasner with the system. And let's not forget Amorim's exploits at Sporting using 3-4-3 earned him the Old Trafford job.",
      "The issue was not the system - it was the United squad's inability to perform within it, and Amorim's bizarre refusal to adapt that doomed his reign.",
      "As Adam Bate pointed out here, data analysis suggested 3-4-3 was a long way down the list of formations that suited the squad Amorim inherited. The system requires athletic wing-backs who can contribute in both boxes, versatile No 10s and an effective No 9.",
      "The squad that Amorim took over barely had any of those, yet he ploughed on. Mainoo up front? Fernandes as a No 6? Mason Mount at wing-back? All in service to the system.",
      "Should United's players have done a better job adapting to their head coach's demands? Certainly. Should INEOS have foreseen Amorim's incompatibility with the squad he was being handed? No doubt. And Amorim's refusal to change had long since passed the stage of being self-defeating.",
      "But the 3-4-3 formation has worked before and will work again - just don't expect to see United using it any time soon.Joe Shread",
      "Amorim now joins an ever-growing list of names who have tried - and failed - to drag Manchester United back to their former heights.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag and now Amorim.",
      "A list compiled of names with differing levels of experience and success but there is a common theme from their time at Old Trafford. It ultimately did not work.",
      "Rangnick spoke of the \"open heart surgery\" United needed during his time at the club from December 2021 to May 2022 - but what else can be done?",
      "The ownership structure has changed, new head coaches arrived with their own ideas and fresh investment was inserted across all areas of the squad over the years. But the same issues persisted.",
      "At some point, you have to question whether it is possible to replicate Sir Alex Ferguson's success in Manchester almost 13 years ago.",
      "Their former glory, although historic and woven into English football history forever, casts an immediate shadow on those who fill the hot seat and the expectations that come with it, albeit outdated, set them up for failure regardless of formation, signings and results.Patrick Rowe",

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Benjamin Sesko's issues in front of goal for Manchester United. Plus: John McGinn's touches in the box for Aston Villa, Jhon Arias' reinvention at Wolves and Max Kilman losing aerial duels for West Ham",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 11:41, UK",
      "Benjamin Sesko delayed his shot in the first half and saw it blocked. He badly mistimed a header from an offside position early in the second half, then side-footed the ball the wrong side of the post from close range. It was a difficult day for the striker at Leeds.",
      "Statistically, he finished the 1-1 draw at Elland Road as the player with the game's best chances but once again failed to find the net. It is perhaps the story of his Manchester United career so far, one that has not yet ignited since his big-money move from Leipzig.",
      "Having started each of the last four games, this is his joint-longest run in the side and Sesko can expect to make it five in a row at Burnley on Wednesday evening.",
      "International commitments have robbed United of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in this busy period, but the fixture list was inviting for Sesko. Instead, they have won only one of the last four. Had they beaten Wolves at home and won at Leeds they would now be fourth.",
      "Sesko has had 12 shots in these matches without scoring. The other four men to have had this many shots in the Premier League during this period have each scored at least twice. In terms of non-penalty expected goals, of the top dozen he is the only one not to score.",
      "All of which suggests that Sesko is getting service. There were six attempts on goal against Wolves without seriously testing the goalkeeper. He ranks in the top 12 for non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "Of the top 20, only three players have underperformed in front of goal by a wider margin than the Manchester United man. Whether that poor return from the chances that he has had is an encouraging sign or a reason for concern is a matter of perspective.",
      "These expected goals numbers are in line with his two seasons in the Bundesliga. In that sense, United are getting what they bought, it is just that those shots have not been going in as often as they did in Leipzig, where his conversion was impressive. That can change.",
      "Perhaps the worry for United is that they hoped for more not less. An investment in potential, Sesko's size and speed meant that he was seen as someone on an upward trajectory who could build on hauls of 14 and 13 in those two seasons as a Bundesliga player.",
      "Instead, as with the admittedly older Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, the Premier League has exposed some limitations. Sesko has time on his side and the underlying numbers too. But if this winter was an opportunity for him to step up, it has not yet been seized.",
      "John McGinn is a beloved figure at Aston Villa and at 31 there are not many tricks for him still to be taught. Unai Emery trusts his captain. But that does not mean that the Villa manager cannot demand more. Those demands won the game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In truth, McGinn did not need to venture into the Forest box to score the points-sealing third goal, finishing from long distance when John Victor went walkabout. But he still had to make the run - just as he did for his first goal, that one coming from inside the penalty area.",
      "McGinn had five touches in the opposition box during the game. That is more than in any other Premier League appearance this season, beating his high of four registered against Brentford back in August. He had settled into a rhythm of staying a little deeper.",
      "What a response. McGinn had not scored twice in a game in the Premier League before, achieving the feat in an Aston Villa shirt for only the second time in all competitions - the other also coming against Forest back in the Championship almost seven years ago.",
      "Emery's reputation for improving players is well established and that ability to coax more from his squad has been a feature of Villa's success under him. McGinn, 311 games into his career with the club, still adding new elements to his game only underlines the point.",
      "Mateus Mane has been the star performer for Wolves of late, the catalyst for their improved performance levels as they picked up their first win of the Premier League season against West Ham. But the recall of his new midfield partner Jhon Arias has been key too.",
      "Arias was an unused substitute in the game prior to Rob Edwards' arrival but has featured in every game under him. He came in to start the draw at Manchester United and then scoring the opening goal - his first in a Wolves shirt - in the defeat of the Hammers at Molineux.",
      "His improved form has come in a new role. Having been signed as a winger, he struggled playing with his back to goal, unable to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. But injuries and suspensions forced Edwards to look for a new solution at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed centrally alongside Mane, with Joao Gomes providing protection behind, Arias has been able to find much more space when getting on the ball in deeper areas rather than being restricted to the flank. It has helped him to show more of what he can do.",
      "It has helped Wolves too. The Brazilian duo of Gomes and Andre have Premier League class but as a pair they are not attack-minded enough to threaten the opposition centrally. Neither has scored this season. Arias and Mane, as twin eights, both managed it in one half.",
      "Speaking to Edwards in the press conference after the game, he confessed to having had a sleepless night wondering whether to recall the available again Andre. He opted to stick with Arias and was rewarded. Now he is wondering if he has hit upon something.",
      "\"Potentially,\" acknowledged Edwards. \"I mean, his last two performances have been really good in that more of an eight role, in that deeper role. I think he covers the ground really well. And obviously, he has got a real calmness in possession with the ball.\"",
      "Few expect Arias to stay at Wolves long term and, unlike Mane, it may be that his name will remain synonymous with the club's failings this season. But this belated reinvention is a reminder of his quality. How Wolves will wish they had been able to unlock it sooner.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo said afterwards that he could not remember a worse day on a football pitch in his long career. Maximilian Kilman might well agree. The West Ham defender endured a miserable game on his return to Molineux, booed by his own team's supporters.",
      "The catalyst was the second Wolves goal. Kilman's clearance was an ugly one, contorting his body into a strange position in failing to deal with the ball into the box. It led to West Ham conceding a penalty from which there proved to be no way back for his team.",
      "But the dissatisfaction with Kilman runs deep. A £40m signing in the summer of 2024, his seven-year contract is now seen as emblematic of West Ham's flawed recruitment strategy. Now 28 years of age, the hope was that Kilman would be a dominant figure at the back.",
      "On Saturday, he was outmuscled by Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare. Kilman lost eight aerial duels to the Nigerian, the most that he has ever lost in a Premier League game for West Ham - although his three worst displays in this regard have all come this season.",
      "At his best, Kilman can be calm and competent in possession but he has never been the most demonstrative of defenders. A popular figure in a mid-table Wolves side, the expectations were rather different when he was a bargain buy from Maidenhead United.",
      "At West Ham, he has become a lightning rod for fan frustration, unable to convince with his body language, sparking accusations of timidity. If Kilman is ever to win over those supporters, he will need to win far more of his aerial duels than he did at Molineux.",
