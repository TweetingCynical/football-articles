      "Tottenham will soon seal a coup over Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, following their earlier setback with Bryan Mbeumo. The Red Devils are still keen on landing the Brentford striker, who prefers Manchester over North London, but have missed out on Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White and West Ham's Mohammed Kudus to Spurs.",
      "The Europa League victors have kicked off their summer spending, having only signed Japanese prospect Kota Takai before this week, and sealed a £55million deal for the Hammers' Kudus on Thursday evening.",
      "Spurs are also nearing a deal for Gibbs-White after meeting the Forest playmaker's £60m buy-out fee, and he is set for a medical at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Friday, with his arrival imminent.",
      "Red Devils head coach Amorim has been handed a double blow in light of these moves, as he has shown admiration for both players in the past. Spurs have gotten their revenge after their efforts to sign Mbeumo were rebuffed, with the Cameroonian expressing his preference for United.",
      "Earlier in the year, United's interest in Gibbs-White was exposed by ex-chief scout Mick Brown, who disclosed Amorim's admiration for him, speaking to Football Insider.",
      "\"United have been looking at Morgan Gibbs-White. He's a player who is highly mobile, works very hard, and has this sort of dynamism to his game,\" he revealed.",
      "\"That's something Ruben Amorim likes and needs in the system he wants to play. I'm told Amorim is a big fan of Gibbs-White from what he's seen.",
      "\"He's spoken before about Mason Mount, who's been injured, but is not too dissimilar to Gibbs-White in terms of the role they would play. I think that's a move United will be interested in if they can tempt him to leave Forest.",
      "\"Whether they'd be able to get it done, because of their financial situation, is unclear. Nottingham Forest won't let Gibbs-White go cheaply. It will be a huge fee to tempt them into selling.\"",
      "The Guardian also reported just last week that Kudus was on Amorim's list of potential attacking summer recruits, but the Ghanaian evidently chose Tottenham.",
      "While United's initial intrigue in Gibbs-White and Kudus waned as they pursued other offensive reinforcements, the club has successfully acquired Wolves ace Matheus Cunha for a lofty £62.5m and are still in negotiations over Mbeumo, whose price tag remains a sticking point, reports the Express.",
      "There are murmurs that Brentford may have underestimated Mbeumo's worth, particularly after Forest accepted a whopping £55m bid for Anthony Elanga and with Chelsea's Noni Madueke set to join Arsenal for more than £50m.",
      "According to the Evening Standard, after a 20-goal haul in last season's Premier League, Brentford believe their £63m valuation of Mbeumo might be on the low side. This spells potential trouble for United, who are eager for a team overhaul but must stay within PSR parameters.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "For a while, it was an open secret but during the last international break, Thomas Tuchel confirmed one of the main reasons why Jordan Henderson is a key member of his England squad. Tuchel is satisfied 35-year-old Henderson can still do a job on the pitch at elite level but, just as importantly, he believes the former Liverpool captain is a leader off the field.",
      "“He is a very important addition to this group,” Tuchel said. “Especially when we talk about setting standards and keeping the group up to standards.”",
      "Those remarks came after a painful 1-0 win over mighty Andorra and a 3-1 loss to Senegal, so judgement on how Tuchel’s reasoning is working out should be put on hold. But Tuchel is not the only manager to value Henderson’s attitude to dressing-room culture.",
      "“What makes a footballer?” Jurgen Klopp once asked. “Is it talent? Or is it the attitude? Well, it is having the perfect mix. And Hendo is the answer to that.”",
      "That was some time back and, since then, Henderson left for Saudi Arabia before going to Ajax. The move to Al-Ettifaq was a deeply ill-advised one, professionally and personally.",
      "Seemingly a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, that was one obvious reason why he should have resisted the move and, on a playing level, it was too early to leave elite European football. His time at Ajax has not been without controversy - there was a tale about him wanting to walk out for a move to Monaco, which he denied - but he has played to a decent level, appearing 57 times and captaining the club.",
      "And while Tuchel has been pilloried by many - including myself - for starting Henderson in some of his line-ups, you have to be fair and say the veteran has done okay in his international second coming. But does 35 count as 'veteran'? Not in modern football. You all know the examples - no need to list them.",
      "Henderson looks fit and lean and gets about the pitch as well as anybody in an England shirt. And now, he is available without a fee, Ajax having agreed to terminate his contract.",
      "Someone, somewhere, is going to get a great free transfer. It won’t be Manchester United.",
      "There is the deep Liverpool connection, for a start and even if Ruben Amorim liked him, imagine how it would go down with the fans. But perhaps Amorim needs someone like Henderson to sort out a dressing-room that has been plagued by under-performing prima donnas.",
      "Imagine how Henderson would have dealt with the tantrums of Alejandro Garnacho or how he would have tried to sort out Marcus Rashford if he thought he was not pulling his weight. It is not going to happen but Henderson is the sort of character the Manchester United dressing-room needs.",
      "If he ends up at a Premier League club, Henderson will not be an automatic starter, no matter which one of the 20 is his destination. And he will know that.",
      "But you won’t just be getting a very decent squad player, you will be getting a leader who stands for no nonsense on the training pitch or in the dressing-room. And if you don’t believe that, ask Thomas Tuchel.",

      "Manchester United have completed their third signing of the summer transfer window - but it is not Bryan Mbeumo. The club remain in talks to sign the Brentford star, but discussions are continuing after two bids were rejected.",
      "However, United did announced a signing on Thursday. France youth international Enzo Kana-Biyik has signed with the club, following in the footsteps of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "But there is still an awful lot of work to do for United, who are keen to overhaul Ruben Amorim's squad entirely following a miserable 2024/25 campaign which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "They are still trying to sell Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho in deals which will bolster their budget for new signings. There are now just five weeks until the start of United's Premier League season, on August 17, meaning the clock is ticking. Here are the latest headlines involving the club.",
      "United have signed Kana-Biyik and immediately sent him out on loan. The 18-year-old forward is considered one for the future after scoring nine goals in 18 games for Le Havre's under-19s team last season.",
      "He will play his 2025/26 season in Switzerland, with United confirming in a statement: \"Following the signing of his contract, the emerging talent has secured a loan switch to Swiss Super League side, Lausanne-Sport.",
      "\"Everyone at United would like to welcome Enzo to the club and wish him the very best of luck for his loan.\"",
      "United have seen two bids knocked back by Brentford for Mbeumo and talks are still going on. The Bees rejected United's initial offer of £55m, then knocked back a second bid worth £62.5m. They reportedly believe their valuation of the Cameroon international is more than fair, given the £55m Newcastle are paying Nottingham Forest for Anthony Elanga.",
      "Mbeumo is set on a move to Old Trafford, but the transfer fee remains the sticking point. United may want to get a move on, with Tottenham's planned move for Yoane Wissa potentially affecting things.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Wissa had an outstanding campaign in 2024/25 and Brentford may be reluctant to let both of them leave in the same window, especially after they lost manager Thomas Frank to Spurs. \"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen,\" Rio Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?\"",
      "United are locked in talks with Napoli over the potential departure of Garnacho. Napoli failed with a £60m bid for Garnacho in January, but are still keen on the Argentina international winger.",
      "The Serie A champions want to pay £45m for Garnacho this time, but United value him higher. The question will be how long United are willing to drag out negotiations, given they want his future sorted and want the money to reinvest in the transfer market.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis reckons Garnacho will become an even better player once he leaves United. \"Garnacho's got pace, flair and potential,\" he said. \"But that's not even why we want him. We want him because he's at United. Get him out and he becomes twice the player. There's a fault at United that I can't explain.\"",

      "Brazil forward Cunha, 26, said it was a “privilege” to wear the shirt and hopes it can inspire him to match the exploits of his illustrious predecessors at United.",
      "“I can mention many players that used this shirt.” said Cunha. It's so easy for me.",
      "“Of course, I think the one that I always think about when I see this number in this shirt for me was Rooney. He was someone that I grew up to watch him play and I have watched many games now.",

      "“We were joking when I went to the locker room, we’re talking about some games, especially with Maz [Noussair Mazraoui]. I think it's always with him, my [individual] battle. But, of course, we’re talking about the games, we’re talking about the seasons and then, yeah, I think everyone was very lovely with me. It was a very warm welcome.",

Brazil's style-masters of the 1970 World Cup complete the prestigious top three, staking their claim as another unforgettable international powerhouse.

      "The domestic game also tugged at supporters' heartstrings, with 36% opting for their club team to win a trophy over 26% who would choose their country's success if faced with the decision. Fans predict a tight contest in a hypothetical match between the best international team and the top domestic 11, with the club side narrowly winning the vote (41% vs 39%).",

      "Manchester United have discovered what it'll take to finally sign Jarrad Branthwaite. Branthwaite, 23, was the subject of two bids from United in 2024, with the Red Devils' second offer worth a total of £50million.",
      "Everton rejected both proposals, valuing the defender much higher. After helping the Toffees soar away from the relegation scrap and cement their Premier League status last season, Branthwaite has signed a new five-year contract, putting him among the Merseyside club's highest earners.",
      "The deal keeps him at Everton's new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock until 2030. But they'll be powerless to stop Branthwaite from leaving if a club actives his release clause and agrees personal terms - as United reportedly did a year ago before they turned to Leny Yoro.",
      "According to the Mail, his new contract includes an exit clause worth more than £70m which becomes active next summer. Branthwaite is happy working under Toffees manager David Moyes but has ambitions of playing Champions League football and breaking into the England squad.",
      "The 23-year-old made his senior debut for the Three Lions in June of last year before missing out on Gareth Southgate's squad for the European Championship. Branthwaite is yet to receive a call-up since Thomas Tuchel was appointed.",
      "But the centre-back's stock has remained high, with Tottenham said to have considered making an approach earlier this summer. The former Carlisle United prospect was also linked with a sensational move to Real Madrid during ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti's tenure which ended in May.",
      "For now, though, Branthwiate is firmly focussed on helping the Toffees get off to a successful start in their new home after leaving Goodison Park. \"I'm over the moon. It's been something we've been talking about since the end of the season and to get it signed now is something I'm really excited about,\" he told club media.",

Spurs have since focused their attentions on Wissa, who scored 19 goals in the Premier League last season - one less than Brentford team-mate Mbeumo.",

Since then, United have failed to challenge for the Premier League and ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish since they were relegated in the 1973/74 campaign.",
      "Former United defender Nemanja Vidic reckons his old club have been held to ransom by players who do not have the character to succeed there – but were only too happy to take the money.",
      "Asked if envisaged United not winning the Premier League for 12 years, Vidic said: “No chance. My feeling is that Sir Alex Ferguson left but so did David Gill as well – that’s two big personalities who had been with the club for 25-years.",
      "“They’re difficult to replace and Ed Woodward taking that position, I think was above his knowledge and his capability – that’s my opinion. Obviously, he did fantastic for the club in terms of the marketing and bringing money in, but dealing with agents and players, that role needs someone with experience.",
      "“Even having some ex-footballers around to understand how the players think and how the agent thinks [would have helped]. At the time, the club didn’t help themselves in terms of not bringing in the knowledge of ex-players like Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, or Ryan Giggs – someone who has experienced talking with agents.",
      "“I think sometimes with the salaries and the money we’ve paid to certain players, we’ve been cheated. That for me is the problem. Recruitment is the biggest thing, bringing in good football players, coaches, medical staff, and I think that they should be careful with what kind of people they bring into certain places.",
      "“To be at Manchester United you have to be one of the best in the market, and you have to invest in that – maybe even more than in the players and I think that we haven’t done that well.",
      "“It’s difficult to be at United now, to be a football player or the owner – whatever you do, it’s difficult so if you want to change the club, the club has to bring in the characters. If the characters aren’t in the club, it is difficult, and you will go through this situation.",
      "“If you bring in people who are going to be nice, smiling, and saying things that you want to hear, I don’t think that’s the way forward. You need people who will take responsibility and be strong enough to say the things they see, even if they have to deal with the consequences.”",
      "Vidic, who took his coaching badges while playing for United but who has so far resisted the lure of returning to work in football, claimed players have too much power these days, which makes it even harder for managers.",
      "“Football players have too much power and because of the money involved, the owner respects the opinion of an agent and player more than the manager,” said Vidic. “That’s the issue we have now. If you have a strong character and personality and have a conflict with a player now, I think the coach will be the one to leave the club.",
      "“This is the era of a new generation of a manager who needs to be careful with how they talk to players – to be a psychologist. You cannot treat all players the same, or owners, and fans. Sir Alex Ferguson was great at this, but it’s even more difficult now.”",

      "However, the journey to securing Mbeumo's services has been far from plain sailing, given United have already seen two initial bids for the 25-year-old rebuffed by the Bees after failing to meet their valuation. Now the Old Trafford top brass are set to launch an improved third offer exceeding £60million to finally get a deal over the line - although there's no guarantee Brentford will agree to sell at the new price.",
      "Ferdinand, whose time at United spanned an impressive 12 years from 2002 to 2014, has labelled securing Mbeumo an essential move ahead of the upcoming campaign to stave off potential ridicule. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the ex-defensive stalwart said: \"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United.",
      "\"So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn't seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",

      "\"It's gone public, they've allowed that to happen, and they're in a position now where they've got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.\"",
      "On why Mbeumo is a top fit for the club, Ferdinand added: \"He fits the bill for me physically. He's dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.\"",
      "Regarding Brentford's stance, the club reportedly want at least £65m to let their star winger leave this summer. Director of football Phil Giles has said on the matter: \"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised. He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer. If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Mbeumo had a stellar 2024/25 season with the Bees, netting 20 goals and setting up eight more in 38 Premier League games. As his contract with the club runs until next summer, with an option for Brentford to extend it for another year, the board are not under pressure to sell unless they receive an offer that meets their valuation for the Cameroon international.",

      "Manchester United have taken steps towards revamping their scouting department as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s push to change the way the club operates. Ratcliffe has been on a crusade to cut costs since taking control of the club in February 2024 and views recruitment as one of the areas that most needs addressing.",
      "Since INEOS took control of the club, there have been a huge number of redundancies across the board – and the scouting department is no exception. The idea is to streamline the previously bloated department by better utilising data, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell at the helm.",
      "Vivell joined in February last year and has won support of the INEOS decision-makers through his work behind the scenes. Director of scouting Steve Brown, who was hired in 2016 by ex-football director John Murtough, has now left the club, with many other scouts following suit.",
      "Just a few years ago, United used to use around 140 scouts. That number dropped to 80 earlier this year and is expected to be reduced even further, with a change in structure being implemented from the top down.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that ‘sports intelligence agency’ Sportsology is now working on United’s behalf to find new hires. The London-based consultancy is looking for a head of senior recruitment, a head of emerging talent and several other senior roles, who will report to Vivell.",
      "A report from earlier this year showed that United have racked up a staggering net spend of €1.3bn (£1.08bn) since 2015 – more than any other club in the world – without seeing the benefits on the pitch. They have not won the Premier League since 2013 and will be without any European football in 2025/26, having finished 15th and lost the Europa League final.",
      "They have already splashed out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and are negotiating the transfer of Bryan Mbeumo, who will cost north of £60m. A squad overhaul is planned, with the departures of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho helping to fund further arrivals.",
      "Ratcliffe has been open about making the “difficult” decisions he believes are necessary to turn things around at United. \" Manchester United has become mediocre,\" he told the United We Stand fanzine earlier this year.",
      "\"It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.”",
      "He added: \"I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.\"",

      "\"If I was Eddie Howe, Mbeumo would be one of the first I’d want through the door. By signing him, you’re harming Manchester United, you’re taking a brilliant player away from Brentford, and you make your squad better too. There’s three ways to win by signing him, even though I do think he’ll still go to Manchester United. He’ll be a brilliant signing.\"",
      "It would be a huge blow for those at Old Trafford, after all their efforts, they missed out on Mbeumo. Currently the only player they've signed this summer is Matheus Cunha. Mbeumo and Brentford have become frustrated with the slow progress of a potential deal involving the Manchester outfit. The Bees are holding firm over their asking price and are open to other offers for Mbeumo as United weigh up a third bid.",

      "His exit brought to an end a two-decade association with the club having progressed through their academy to make over 250 first-team appearances. McTominay’s sale was thought to have been a boost to United’s PSR calculations given any fee they received would have represented pure profit.",
      "Despite the circumstances of his departure, McTominay has said that he does not harbour any ill feelings towards his former club. He said: “I always want the absolute best for Manchester United. It’s been my life for 22, 23 years so for me, I wish the club all the success in the world.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last term, United went into this summer's window knowing the scale of the changes that needed to be made. They have prioritised attacking signings and the prospect of heading to the US with Cunha and Mbeumo in the bank would be fantastic.",
      "In addition to trying to sign Cunha and Mbeumo, United also want a centre-forward. But after Liam Delap joined Chelsea last month, their striker search is yet to provide an answer.",
      "There is a strong chance United's search for a No.9 will still be active by the time the Premier League season starts in mid-August. United had to wait until the final day of last summer's window to recruit Manuel Ugarte, who was drafted in to fix their biggest problem position.",
      "With their pursuit of Mbeumo still ongoing, United are highly unlikely to get him and a striker through the door ahead of the opening game of the Premier League Summer Series against West Ham United in New Jersey on July 27.",
      "It means the responsibility of leading United's attack in the US is likely to rest on the shoulders of either Rasmus Hojlund or Chido Obi. The former has not had a full pre-season at United after arriving too late in August 2023 and getting injured in the first game of last summer's tour.",
      "Obi, too, has not had a pre-season since joining United. He joined the club last September and had to go through what was essentially an individual pre-season before being unleashed for the Under-18s and later graduating to the first-team.",
      "Hojlund scored just ten goals last season, meaning justifiable doubts have been raised about him leading United's attack in 2025/26. The Reds are open to selling him and Inter Milan have expressed interest in his signature.",
      "Hojlund has regressed since joining United and a lot of supporters have given up on him. There is no doubt the club needs to recruit a new starting striker this summer.",
      "But until United oversee a crop of sales, they will be unable to fund the addition of a No.9 amid the £62.5m signing of Cunha and the ongoing pursuit of Mbeumo. United will also owe £89m on signings from previous windows this summer.",
      "With patience required, Obi will be looking to make his mark in pre-season and potentially leapfrog Hojlund in the pecking order in the race to become Amorim's first-choice No.9 in the US.",
      "The talented 17-year-old ended last season on a positive note, scoring two goals in United's 3-1 win over Hong Kong on the post-season tour. It goes without saying the outcome of that match meant nothing and the second half goals Obi plundered have not even made the record books.",
      "However, the Danish youth international demonstrated in that second half that he has the natural instincts all good strikers need to have. His opener saw him swivel inside the box and fire home an instinctive finish before he anticipated a Mason Mount cross to head home his second.",
      "His movement to ensure he was in the right place at the right time was down to his natural instincts, which is something that can be rarely taught on the training ground.",
      "It must be stressed that this is not an argument for Obi to become United's main striker come the start of the season. There is an obvious need for the Reds to recruit an established goalscorer to spearhead their attack this summer.",
      "But with their striker search no closer to being solved, Amorim could throw caution to the wind in pre-season and look ahead to United's long-term future by giving Obi the nod.",

      "Kana-Biyik is following in the footsteps of Paul Pogba, who also joined United as a teenager from Le Havre.",
      "The arrival of Kana-Biyik comes shortly after the signing of Diego Leon was confirmed. Leon, 18, completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and the club believe he is another talented young player with potential to reach the first-team."

      "Hello and welcome to our live blog on the very latest Manchester United transfer news on Friday, July 11.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men are back in pre-season training at Carrington as preparations for the 2025/26 get underway. However, there remains a big focus on United's transfer business.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves for £62.5million but the Reds have struggled to get a deal over the line for Bryan Mbeumo. Two bids have been turned down by Brentford and a third bid has been tipped.",
      "Alongside the 25-year-old, United are also exploring the possibility of signing a new striker. A move for Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres has been mentioned for the majority of the summer but Amorim is facing being short on options.",
      "Free agents Jamie Vardy, Callum Wilson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin have all reportedly been offered to United. A move for either is expected to only be sanctioned closer to the end of the window, if other top targets aren't signed.",
      "Keep across all the latest United transfer news and analysis in our live blog updates below...",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford drove into Carrington on Thursday to train on his own again. Rashford, 27, arrived at Carrington at 4.47pm, eight minutes after Ruben Amorim had departed.",
      "United sources have denied Rashford was attending Carrington to discuss his future and said the 27-year-old has been training in the afternoons on an individual basis this week.",
      "Rashford arrived through the back gate entrance at Carrington, and Amorim used the front gate.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United are considering a summer swoop for Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is available as a free agent after leaving Everton at the end of last month, according to CaughtOffside.",
      "Calvert-Lewin, 28, scored just three goals in 26 Premier League appearances last season and it's claimed he is a 'serious' target for United, but wages could prove to be an issue.",
      "Calvert-Lewin is expected to ask for around £100,000 per week - a demand that could come as too expensive for the Reds.",
      "Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi is Manchester United's top target for that position, according to reports in Italy.",
      "He made 44 appearances in all competitions last season and kept 18 clean sheets - 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League.",
      "However, any deal for Carnesecchi may be dependent on Andre Onana's future and a move for the Cameroonian.",
      "According to 90min.com, Juventus are keen to offload Dusan Vlahovic this summer and Manchester United are showing interest.",
      "It's added that United may have the edge after opening talks over a swap deal involving out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Vlahovic, 25, scored 17 goals in 44 appearances during the 2024/25 season and netted against Manchester City at the Club World Cup.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer news blog on this fine Friday morning.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest throughout the day from Old Trafford...",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United transfer blog tonight.",
      "We will be back again bright and early tomorrow bringing you more updates from Old Trafford.",
      "Until then, take care of yourselves and good night.",
      "After a cryptic post on social media of himself on a private jet with the simple caption: \"Coming,\" it appears Garnacho is free to train with the Reds' first-team.",
      "Despite being told by Amorim that he is free to find a new club this summer, ESPN understands that the Argentine will not be blocked from training with his teammates when he returns to Carrington.",
      "Garnacho is one of five players who informed United that he wished to sign for another club in the summer transfer window. He was therefore given an extended break to try and facilitate a deal elsewhere.",
      "It is hard to argue against what Ferdinand is saying about Mbeumo.",
      "United have got themselves too deep into this saga not to sign the Cameroonian now.",
      "Not signing Mbeumo would be a huge come down for the Reds and risks being a very bad start to the summer transfer window.",
      "Tomorrow, there will be 37 days remaining until the start of the Premier League season and United have only made one major signing...",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Rio Ferdinand has insisted that United have little choice but to meet Brentford's valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "United need to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. The proposal doesn't seem to be enough for Brentford, but Manchester United need to get this done. It's been in the news for far too long, to get to a situation to get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen, I think that will be an egg-on-the-face situation for Man United unless they go and get someone else. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? We haven't heard any names that are close.",
      "Despite these reports of a delay in negotiations between Napoli and Galatasaray for Osimhen, it seems this ship has sailed for United.",
      "The Reds are still focused on Mbeumo and that could be to their detriment.",
      "Osimhen will be given a hero's welcome back to Istanbul should he complete this move and you have to think that United could have missed a trick.",
      "According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Napoli have paused transfer talks with Galatasaray for Victor Osimhen.",
      "It is understood that there has been a delay to the move due to Gala's current inability to provide 'bank guarantees'.",
      "As such, the talks have been halted until these guarantees have been met.",
      "United confirmed this afternoon that young defender Sonny Aljofree has left the club to join Notts County on loan.",
      "The 20-year-old made 25 appearances for Accrington Stanley last season in League Two and he returns to that level with the Nottinghamshire club.",
      "In 2022, Aljofree starred alongside Garnacho and Mainoo as the young Reds won the Youth Cup.",
      "According to Sport, Antony has a burning desire to sign for Real Betis in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is understood that there is currently no agreement in place with the Seville club at this stage.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Antony is one of five players who has told the club he wants to leave this summer.",
      "Real Betis are reportedly confident enough that Antony wants to sign for them that they are willing to drag the saga into the final stages of the window to force United's hand.",
      "According to Cameroon's assistant Ashu Cyprian Besong, Mbeumo is growing increasingly frustrated by the lack of movement in the switch to United.",
      "Speaking to Telecom Asia, Besong said:",
      "Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on. But of course, he’s already told them he wants to go to United. He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he’s very grateful for the opportunity that he’s been given by Brentford in his career.",
      "It is being reported this evening that Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White is set for a medical at Tottenham after Spurs activated his release clause.",
      "With that, David Ornstein reports that Forest have renewed their interest in Brentford's Yoane Wissa and with money coming in for both Gibbs-White and Elanga, the east Midlands club have money to spend.",
      "Yesterday we brought you news that the Bees are only willing to allow one of Wissa or Mbeumo to leave this summer.",
      "At the moment, there has yet to be a breakthrough in negotiations with Brentford for Mbeumo so Forest's interest in Wissa could be a concern.",
      "Hello and welcome to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the rest of the evening with all the latest United news as and when we get it.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with several potential new signings as the summer transfer window rolls on.",
      "One area of the pitch that has become the centre of the transfer speculation is at centre forward. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are the current striker options at United, but there are rumours that there could be new additions to the position at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha has been signed from Wolves, with the £62.5million new addition also capable of performing in a centre forward role.",
      "United had hoped to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town this summer, but the striker instead chosen to join Chelsea in a £30million deal.

Rashford is reportedly keen on a move to La Liga side Barcelona, who are looking to bolster their forward line.",
      "Barca's recent move for Nico Williams appeared to end any pursuit of the United forward, only for a dramatic twist which saw the Spanish international agree new terms with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "It's re-opened the door for Rashford, who is still pushing for an exit from United, though recent reports may have handed him yet another blow. Hansi Flick's team have also been linked with a move for Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, along with Bayern Munich and clubs in Saudi Arabia.",

      "There is still plenty of time for United to complete their transfer business for the summer, while it seems another deal has emerged as a possibility. And should the deal prove to be genuine, it would see United needing to enter negotiations with Brentford once again.",
      "Caught Offside have reported that Yoane Wissa is now a concrete target for United this summer. The report has claimed that United will battle Tottenham Hotspur for the signing of the 28-year-old - who scored 20 goals in all competitions last season.",

      "Manchester United are still planning to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford in around five years.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the project could be completed by 2030.",
      "Club sources say the project has progressed well in the past few months. The feasibility work on land assembly and financing continues, which will inform the pace at which the project will move, but United are still planning to realise their vision in the initial timeframe.",
      "That update came as the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, announced a 10-year growth plan for the region.",
      "The Old Trafford Regeneration project is a part of the growth plan and Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as the Chair-Designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) to oversee it.",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO of United, reacted to the update and said: “This is an exciting decade for the region, and we warmly welcome the inclusion of the Old Trafford Regeneration project at the heart of the Greater Manchester Strategy.",
      "“We are also delighted by the appointment of Lord Coe as Chair-Designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation; the continuity it brings for the wider project will be a huge positive. In addition, Lord Coe’s proven leadership and track record in delivering transformational projects will be invaluable as we work together to turn our collective vision into reality.",
      "“In March, we announced our ambition for a new stadium and since then we have been progressing those plans. Today’s announcement is a significant step forward in our shared vision for the revival of this area of the city that requires investment to thrive again.”",
      "United have conceded they cannot deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone, which has seen the club work closely with national and local government, as well as Trafford Council.",
      "The club and city region are also said to be aligned with the aim of bringing significant fixtures at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final, as much of the regeneration of the area will be complete.",

      "When Manchester United appointed Ruben Amorim as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, few players in the squad stood to benefit more than Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The midfield enforcer, who had joined United from Paris Saint-Germain just over two months earlier, worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, racking up 85 appearances under his stewardship during his time in the Portuguese capital.",
      "Ugarte had arrived at Old Trafford from the Parc des Princes with the task of providing United's midfield with some much-needed defensive nous.",
      "Despite an excellent debut season at United in 2022/23, Casemiro regressed the following season, making the addition of a defensive-minded midfielder a leading priority for the 2024 summer transfer window. United spent several weeks in negotiations with PSG and eventually signed Ugarte on deadline day last August.",
      "After confirming Ugarte's arrival for an initial fee of £42.3million, former United sporting director Dan Ashworth said of the Uruguayan international: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer. He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.",
      "\"His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "Evidence of that was on show in the latter stages of Ten Hag's tenure when he appeared reluctant to select the former Sporting midfielder. He played just seven times under the Dutchman prior to his exit on October 28, making just three starts, of which only one of them was in the Premier League.",
      "It meant the appointment of Amorim felt significant in Ugarte's hopes of nailing down his place in the team. Many anticipated he would join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",
      "Despite playing 34 times between Amorim's arrival and the end of the season, Ugarte's omission from the starting line-up for the Europa League final and the Premier League finale against Aston Villa felt telling.",
      "Casemiro got the nod against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, starting in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes. Ugarte failed to make it off the bench that evening.",
      "Throughout his debut season at Old Trafford, United fans saw the good and the bad of Ugarte. They witnessed how he has the credentials to maintain order in midfield out of possession, helping United keep their shape and win possession back, but they also witnessed flaws in his game when in possession.",
      "Unlike in France and Portugal, Ugarte is not blessed with as much time on the ball in the Premier League. The division is played at a frantic pace and you need eyes in the back of your head.",
      "As a defensive shield and midfield battering ram, Ugarte offers all of the varying qualities you need to fulfil that duty. On the ball, though, he is far from perfect, meaning it is easy to understand why United want to sign a midfielder this summer who can offer a little bit of everything.",
      "However, amid United's desperate need to strengthen their attack, the addition of a midfielder might be put on the back burner.",
      "Fernandes is poised to occupy one of the two No.8 spots and he will need a defensive-minded operator alongside him to ensure United maintain a sense of balance in midfield.",
      "Ugarte is best qualified to offer that defensive nous, but he must raise his game if he is to make one of the two central midfield spots his own. As a result, pre-season will be vitally important for him this summer.",
      "He joined United on August 31 last year, meaning he was thrown in at the deep end. Adjusting to a new club is hard enough, but when you join a club of United's stature, and are tasked with the challenge of fixing the team's biggest weakness, the job becomes even harder.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt this summer, Ugarte should be all the better for it. If he makes the most of it, there is no reason why he cannot reach his best levels under Amorim again."

      "The rhetoric surrounding the club this summer has been the need to sign a centre-forward. Hojlund has been linked to the exit door to make that happen despite insisting that he expects to stay at United this summer.",
      "Whether he leaves or not, a new centre-forward is certainly needed. Joshua Zirkzee clearly plays better in the No.10 role and even if Amorim is going to persevere with him as a striker, at least one new centre-forward is needed to provide decent cover to the team.",
      "On Friday, there are just 37 days remaining before the start of the Premier League season. Before then, United will face four Premier League opponents and Fiorentina to prepare for that opening day against Arsenal.",
      "During this timeline, Hojlund will need to prove to Amorim that he can be trusted to be the main striker. If he can do that, the Portuguese could save himself £60m or more in transfer fees.",
      "Strikers at the top of their games this summer have all been valued around this mark. Ollie Watkins, Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres could all improve United but will cost a king's ransom.",
      "However, if Hojlund proves himself to be capable of being a main striker who can reliably score, a move for a free agent could be seen as viable for Amorim. Signing a player like Callum Wilson or Jamie Vardy could be ideal for United and provide the Dane with a valuable partner to learn from.",
      "But these are all big ifs at the moment. Based on last season, Amorim will feel as though he needs to spend big to strengthen his attack.",
      "Only Hojlund can change his mind."

A whole host of rumours have already been circling which have claimed to provide updates on the players that are of interest to United.",

      "United sold Carreras to Benfica, last summer, in a deal worth £5million. United also included a sell-in clause in that agreement 12 months ago, although it remains unclear what exact percentage of any future fee they'd be entitled to as and when his switch to Real is formalised.",
      "Reports have speculated that Carreras could be set to join Madrid for €50million (£43million), the value of the left-back's release clause at Benfica. If this was to be the case, United could be entitled to as much as £4.3million with a 10 per cent sell-on clause or £8.6million with 20 per cent.",
      "If United are merely entitled to a percentage of any profit, that would see the figures decrease marginally. A 10 per cent sell-on clause would see United given £3.8million - and a 20 per cent clause would result in a £7.6million bonus for United.",
      "If Carreras does go on to join Madrid and United receive a sell-on clause value, it could be part of a double transfer windfall for the club. Ex-United winger Anthony Elanga is reportedly close to joining Newcastle in a £55million deal.",
      "United sold Elanga to Forest last summer for £15million - but did include a 20 per cent sell-on clause for any future profit. That means United could receive as much as £8million if Elanga does go on to complete a move to St James' Park.",
      "Combined, it's possible that United may receive as much as £16.6million from two deals that don't involve any of their own players. These funds could go a long way to helping the club complete their own transfer business this summer."

      "The success of ‘Welcome to Wrexham’, the Disney+ show that has charted the rise of Wrexham under Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney is something many clubs want a slice of, with the popularity of the Welsh side having soared across the Atlantic in the United States and positively impacted revenues to the tune of millions.",
      "Birmingham City, who count NFL legend Tom Brady among their ownership group, will launch their own documentary later this year on Amazon Prime Video, while Amazon’s ‘All or Nothing’ series has been hugely popular in recent years, featuring the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "On Monday it was reported by The Athletic that Manchester United had turned down the opportunity to become the latest stars of the small screen for Amazon, with the call being made to end the talks after boss Ruben Amorim expressed his dissatisfaction.",
      "The report claimed that United executives had been in talks with Amazon for several months with the idea being to produce a documentary on what is set to be a hugely important season for United on the back of their worst in the Premier League era in 2024/25. The money on offer was set to be ‘significantly more’ than £10m and the most money that any team had ever received for an ‘All or Nothing’ documentary.",
      "Despite the on-pitch struggles in recent years for United, the club retains its status as one of the most iconic brands in world sport, and after such a period of tumult, the potential to film what comes next was an enticing prospect to the streaming giant.",
      "In saying no, the club not only misses out on the millions from the deal, but it also reduces its global exposure to audiences at a time when they are going to find themselves out of the European football spotlight. In terms of what that can deliver for the club, it can attract new fans, who build a lifelong connection with the club and become active customers during that period. But the upside wasn’t enough to convince Amorim, and that might not be the worst thing.",
      "By virtue of being Manchester United, every element of what the club does is scrutinised. For Amorim, the 2025/26 season will be one where he has to return the club back to basics to try and address the alarming decline, and for the sake of £15m or £20m, money that could be accrued through player trading, of which United have many saleable assets they can book a profit on, the potential intrusion and impact that may have caused to a squad where plenty have already shown the weight of history and expectation to hang heavy, wasn’t deemed worth the risk.",
      "This was likely a pretty easy no to take for United and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, particularly if it was felt that it would hamper the club’s chances of returning themselves to European football’s elite Champions League group by the end of this season, a feat that would yield far greater financial gains that a documentary would.",
      "But storytelling is only going to become more prevalent, and clubs are going to find more ways to try and find a narrative that has broad appeal, especially as the game continues to become more global and when traditional domestic broadcasting rights are being squeezed.",
      "United know they have reach, that has never been a problem, the issue that they have had for some time is a negative perception of the football club, and that isn’t great for fans, current or future, or commercial partners. The lack of competitive success has come at a time of a succession of PR disasters, such as mass redundancies of non-playing staff in a bid to cut costs.",
      "They will need to present a better image in the coming seasons and it should be no surprise if a documentary forms part of that. But for this coming season, the overriding need for the club to get its house in order behind closed doors and have that reflected through improved performances on the pitch is paramount."

Just as they had done with Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in previous years, they wanted to produce an access-all-areas documentary to offer an insight into what goes on behind the scenes at one of the world's biggest sporting institutions.",

      "As a result of losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as what it would have otherwise been, meaning they are having to box clever in this summer's window. Progress has been slow thus far, reflected in the Reds' tally of just two new arrivals, and player sales are key to funding new additions.",
      "With that in mind, the chance to bank more than £10m would have had United's decision makers licking their lips. Every cash injection, however big or small, will be welcomed with open arms this summer.",
      "However, United find themselves walking a fine line between the financial side and the sporting side of the operation. The club's hierarchy knows Amorim has got to oversee a serious improvement next season and it is evident the Portuguese chief believes his players will have a better chance of helping the club climb the table without a TV crew following their every move.",
      "To have adhered to Amorim's request shows that United's decision makers are in full support of the former Sporting Lisbon boss. They have put plenty of trust in him and this decision only strengthens their case to show they are backing him in every possible way.",
      "Ensuring everyone is on the same page is a strong recipe for success, and it is vital for any head coach to have the backing of those above him in the chain of command.",
      "The fact United's top brass have backed out of a deal that would have brought in much-needed funds, to ensure Amorim is more comfortable with hopefully overseeing a season of progress, can only be considered as a positive on the sporting side of the operation.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Zidane Iqbal has detailed how being left out of the starting line-up for the 3-0 win over Charlton Athletic in the Carabao Cup in January 2023 convinced him to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Iqbal was the breakout star of United's 2022 pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia, producing some eye-catching performances that did not go unnoticed.",
      "He was rewarded by making the bench for all six of United's Europa League group games and it felt as though a full debut was inevitable after the Reds were drawn at home to Charlton, who were a League One side at the time, in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals midway through the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Instead, former United manager Erik ten Hag handed a debut to Kobbie Mainoo, who was a relatively unknown figure at the time, meaning Iqbal had to settle for a place on the bench much to his disbelief.",
      "The Iraq international, who now plays for Dutch side FC Utrecht, has revealed how he was in line to start the cup win over the Addicks, admitting his omission from the starting line-up marked the moment he realised he needed a change of scenery.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton Athletic from League One,\" Iqbal told The National. \"I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training.",
      "\"I was starting as a No.10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'.",
      "\"It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted.",
      "\"Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing.",
      "\"That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "The 22-year-old, who was signed by United at the age of eight, left Old Trafford later that year, joining Utrecht in June 2023 on a four-year deal. He has since made 40 appearances, scoring one goal.",
      "His only appearance for United was handed to him by former interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who introduced him from the bench as a late substitute in a 1-1 draw with Young Boys at Old Trafford in December 2021."

      "So the pity is out of the way let’s stick the boot in, a year ago before you came 16th I said that you were just a poor team, it’s still true, you have next to nothing in terms of players that are “Man United” standard, Bruno is the best of a bad bunch and sadly he wouldn’t get into a lot of Prem sides because he’s a bit sh*t.",
      "I really hope that this is the year you get relegated, last year was a close call and Ruben is going to keep his terrible form because he’s not that good, they’ll sack him before Christmas as they should but which idiot will take the poisoned chalice, a lot of managers have taken the United job and none have come out of the other end smelling of roses (maybe the little Norwegian but his other jobs were Molde and Cardiff), you won’t get a good manager and even if you do it won’t matter because you’re poor and will come close to the bottom 3 again (hopefully Leeds spends this mystical £300 million so they can overtake you).",
      "This team is on par with West Ham just 10 times more expensive, it’s not an insult, West Ham are okay, the problem that Man U have is, coming back to the start of this e-mail, your owners have created a toxic atmosphere, every player that has been brought in the last 5 years has been rather good at the club they were at before joining United, Onana looked like he had hands when playing for Ajax, Sancho was in German team of the season, Mason Mount wasn’t constantly injured from embarrassment and Antony was touted as a world beater.",
      "They then joined United and became terrible, this is due to the horrible place that Old Trafford and Carrington has become, it wouldn’t matter if United bought prime Messi and Ronaldo, they would go to United and fall out of love with football and turn poo, you did this to yourself.",
      "Don’t think of relegation as a problem, it is freeing, it is the only way you are going to be sold to someone who may actually like the club more than money, one of your owners has a Chelsea season pass for God’s sake, you should be protesting every match but it doesn’t matter, it won’t get the club sold, just hope for relegation and that someone nice takes over you.",
      "So please stop hoping it’s your year or that you can make a splash in the market (the Mbeumo thing is really funny, even if he came he’d be terrible for you, also Cunha is going to flop), you should hope to get relegated, its the only thing that will save your club otherwise you’ll just be Everton, forever in 17th.\nRich Jennings, Hull (I just looked at United’s full squad on Wiki and it’s p*ss funny)",

They have of course been very close and had a few minor things gone differently they would have won a title, nevertheless there is logic in suggesting the team that finished second just need a few tweaks to finish first. In the same way that there is logic suggesting Liverpool are one of the favourites this year, which you did, rather hypocritically after pointing out that everyone starts on zero points.",
      "There is also logic in people suggesting that the reasons for failing to do better than they have are being addressed could see them become more successful. Yes Liverpool were the best team last season and deserved the title, but Arsenal struggled without a recognised striker and should they get one, then their chances of going one better than second place are increased. That’s all people are saying. Don’t jump on the Liverpool victim train this early me old mate.\nAndrew",

We do all start on zero points in August but the bookies probably won’t have all 20 teams at 25:1. Some of the teams will probably even have kept some of their players from last year.

      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",

      "",
      "22) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "21) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",

      "19) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",

      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",

      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",

      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",

      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",

      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",

      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mohammed Kudus are desperate to take a step down to complete dream moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United."

      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern were looking for a wide forward even before Jamal Musiala’s injury at the Club World Cup. Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",
      "",
      "13) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nMadueke appears to be the most achievable left winger target, assuming Eberechi Eze is a separate pursuit. Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and have agreed a fee with Arsenal. £52m, says Orny. Worth it?",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one is moving fast. Who knew Gibbs-White had a £60m release clause in his contract? Because we sure didn’t. He’s set for a medical on Friday.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

      "8) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders but their business might be almost done now.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £96.76m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has told the club that they have “got to” secure the signing of a Premier League star as they’ve waited “far too long” with no “alternative” in the wings.",
      "United have spent a lot of the last month or so focussing on Bryan Mbeumo. They have already improved the final third with Matheus Cunha, and having Mbeumo in the other No.10 position",
      "United legend Ferdinand feels the saga has been going on too long for United to fail, as he suggested it’s unclear where they’d turn if they didn’t get Mbeumo.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “David Ornstein, who’s a friend of the channel, has reported that he [Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he’s told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford’s valuation.",
      "“I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn’t seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it’s been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn’t happen.",
      "“I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",
      "“We haven’t heard, really, any other names that it seems to be getting close with. So, I’ll be surprised if this deal doesn’t go through, because Man United have been adamant. It’s gone public, they’ve allowed that to happen, and they’re in a position now where they’ve got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.”",
      "Ferdinand is clearly a fan of Mbeumo’s profile, though, stating: “He fits the bill for me physically. He’s dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.”",
      "A recent report suggested United are positive about their chances of landing the Brentford forward before their tour of America.",
      "That begins on July 22, so the Red Devils are ‘confident’ that they’ll have Mbeumo in under two weeks.",
      "Indeed, discussions are continuing and the club feels, though there is currently a gap in valuation between United and Brentford, that they will be able to get their man in time to see him bed in on the tour.",
      "Nottingham Forest have reportedly made a bid for Brentford striker Yoane Wissa, which could have implications for Man Utd’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘confident’ that they will not miss a set deadline as they pursue Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has set a new deadline to complete a deal to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are not sold on their potential deal to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer as “they’re worried” he’s not the “answer”, according to one pundit.",
      "Man Utd transfer target Bryan Mbeumo is ‘growing increasingly frustrated’ at the lack of progress between the Red Devils and Brentford.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price."

      "A Manchester United flop has been told by a broadcaster to return to his old club, as they “love him” as there may not be a chance of “winning something” at a proposed destination.",
      "United have a number of players who they are looking to push out the door this summer. It was recently revealed that Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho had all asked to leave.",
      "For various reasons, it’s unlikely that the club will stand in the way of any of them going.",
      "Sancho has spent the last season and a half out on loan, with Borussia Dortmund and then Chelsea, but the former couldn’t pay his wages permanently, and monetary reasons contributed to the Blues sending him back to United.",
      "He is now being pursued by Juventus, who seem eager to land the winger, if they can finance a deal.",
      "But talkSPORT broadcaster Alan Brazil feels a return to Dortmund – where Sancho scored 50 goals and chipped in with 64 assists in his spell as a permanent player there from 2017 to 2021 – is the best course of action.",
      "“I think he had his best time at Dortmund. If I were him, I’d go there because they love him there, he feels comfortable,” he said.",
      "“Are Juve going to be up there? You want to go there with a chance of winning something.”",
      "But interest from Dortmund is not currently evident, while Juventus are clearly eager to land the winger. Interest from the European giants has been reported for months, and there are various avenues being followed for them to land him.",
      "It has been suggested that there are a couple of potential swap deals in the works, with Juventus pair Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic both separately having been offered to United.",
      "Whether that is the avenue which will land Juventus Sancho remains to be seen, but it seems he’s open to the move.",
      "Reports have suggested that he’s willing to take a pay cut to land in Turin, with a £115,000-per-week (€133,000) contract is being discussed, which would see Sancho’s wage cut by more than half.",
      "It is said he has taken ‘drastic action’ in terms of lowering his demands in order to ensure that move happens.",
      "As a result, it’s stated ‘everyone is waiting’ for him to sign, and all parties are ‘almost at a virtual handshake. Should that happen, a Dortmund return would have to wait, and there’s a distinct chance it never comes.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is ‘closer’ to securing an exit after ‘taking drastic action’ to secure his desired transfer.",
      "Man Utd will welcome any suitor for their band of misfits and here are eight possible reunions which could aid what currently looks like a woefully inadequate summer rebuild.",
      "Former Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bring Jadon Sancho to Besiktas this summer and has made enquiries, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘agreed’ to sell Jadon Sancho to Juventus, but wage demands and transfer terms are proving tricky.",
      "According to reports, the ‘latest development’ at Manchester United has angered four ‘unhappy’ players as INEOS look to cash in on several unwanted talents.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window."

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal is a done deal. Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "Arsenal have announced that they have completed their third summer signing, while Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that another transfer is “absolutely on”.",
      "Arsenal continue to make moves in the summer transfer market with their third signing set to be confirmed this week.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "United have scoured Europe for different striker targets this summer. They know a move for Viktor Gyokeres now won’t be possible, and attempts to land Benjamin Sesko could go the same way.",
      "As such, a move for Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic is being pursued. The Serbian striker cost £67million when Juve signed him in 2022, though it’s recently been suggested that he could be available for as low as £25million.",

      "Juve are eager to get rid of the high wages of Vlahovic, while United just want rid of Sancho in any way possible.",

      "9) Cristhian Mosquera (Valencia)\nAvailable for around £17million, Mosquera is only 21 and out of contract next year, prompting Arsenal to make an offer to sign him this summer. Valencia said no, but personal terms are already in place for the Spaniard to move to the Emirates.",
      "The one-cap Spanish international played in 37 of Valencia’s 38 La Liga matches last season. In the one game he missed, Carlos Corberan’s side lost 7-1 to Barcelona. He probably knew what he was doing with that 94th-minute suspension-clinching yellow card the week before.",
      "Mosquera is one of the most promising central defenders in Europe and it’s no surprise to see Arsenal interested. He’d be outstanding right-footed cover for William Saliba.",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joins Real Madrid.",
      "Still only 21, Silva has played 140 times for Benfica. Extraordinary stuff.",
      "MORE ‘BEST AVAILABLE’ FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Arsenal targets second and third in ranking of the best available strikers this summer\n👉 Best available attacking midfielders: Arsenal-linked Premier League stars in top two\n👉 Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd, Man City outcasts and Spurs captain Son…",
      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often. For my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t prise Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",

      "Including Scandinavian starlets Oscar Bobb and Chido Obi, these 10 Premier League youngsters are ready to go out on loan to a domestic rival this season.",
      "",
      "Oscar Bobb (Manchester City)\nA serious injury robbed Bobb of the chance to establish himself at Man City, and now he’s further down the midfield pecking order than his ability and potential deserve. We can’t think of a Premier League player more in need of a summer loan. He needs to play to realise that incredible potential, which will benefit both City and Norway in the long run.",
      "He’s a special player and needs regular first-team football. There’s a strong chance Pep Guardiola looks abroad. Borussia Dortmund seems an excellent fit, though they’ve just signed Jobe Bellingham, while Bayer Leverkusen could also be an option.",
      "In the Premier League, a mid-table side like Everton, Bournemouth or West Ham would make perfect sense. There’s no doubt Bobb improves those teams, and obviously any of those expected to finish below them. If a newly promoted club like Leeds United manage to get the 21-year-old for the season, they’ll be bloody delighted.",
      "",
      "Tyrique George (Chelsea)\nEvil Saka is a cracking player. Effective on the left, right and even through the middle, the 19-year-old winger could hang around and get insufficient minutes at Stamford Bridge, or get regular minutes elsewhere in the Premier League.",
      "From just 10 starts across all competitions, George has scored three goals and made five assists — a pretty impressive return. He started up front against Manchester United in the Premier League after impressing Enzo Maresca in earlier appearances off the bench.",
      "George would be a real attacking asset for a bottom-half Premier League team; we’re thinking Wolves or Burnley.",

      "The 18-year-old would surely benefit from being as far away as possible from the Old Trafford dumpster fire. They can learn from the Alvaro Carreras mistake by properly developing Amass and ensuring he doesn’t slip through their fingers with measly buy-back options. They really screwed the pooch there, with Carreras off to Real Madrid as the perfect left-wing-back in Xabi Alonso’s system. Ruben Amorim will be raging.",
      "",
      "Mikey Moore (Tottenham)\nA very positive and confident player who’s ready for more minutes than he’s going to get in this Spurs team. It’s maybe a case of quantity over quality, but there’s a lot of competition for places in wide areas, which makes a loan move a sensible option.",
      "Moore is only 17 and someone Spurs rate very, very highly. Loaning him out at such a young age isn’t crucial for his development, but if it goes well, the upside is gargantuan.",
      "",
      "Vitor Reis (Manchester City)\nCity aren’t completely sold on loaning out Reis, just six months after signing him for £30million from Palmeiras. But it does make sense, doesn’t it, lads?",
      "City have so many centre-back options, and if Reis isn’t loaned out, Abdukodir Khusanov surely will be. The players above the two January signings in the pecking order are Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Ruben Dias and Manuel Akanji.",

      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea)\nHopefully this guy isn’t another Lesley Ugochukwu, who Chelsea are desperate to sell after two years and ends up on loan at a historically s**t Premier League team.",
      "Essugo has joined from Sporting for £20m and it’s difficult to envision him getting sufficient minutes in a Chelsea midfield that has several options ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "He spent last season with Las Palmas in La Liga, playing 27 times, and that experience stands him in good stead to consistently feature in a Premier League team next season.",
      "",
      "Chido Obi (Manchester United)\nIt’s anyone’s guess who takes on young Obi, but he has incredible potential and United might view a season of regular first-team football as the best thing for his development. Whatever they decide is best will ultimately turn out to be the worst.",
      "Similarly to Moore, Obi is at an age where it makes sense to keep him around playing youth football and the occasional first-team minutes. But with no Europa League, there won’t be minutes against clubs from Kazakhstan or a Thursday-Sunday schedule that demands rotation.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\n“My plan for Josh Acheampong is very clear. I want him to stay with us. He’s absolutely part of our project,” said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca of the 19-year-old defender, who can play right-back, left-back and centre-back.",
      "A permanent transfer is off the table, but surely Chelsea would be open to loaning Acheampong to another Premier League club to pick up some vital experience before selling him next summer for £25million.",
      "Crystal Palace have reportedly enquired, which could see Acheampong follow in the footsteps of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher by spending time at Selhurst Park on loan from the Blues.",
      "",
      "Tom Watson (Brighton)\nThere’s more chance of Watson going to the Championship than another Premier League club, unless he returns to Sunderland for the season.",
      "The 19-year-old scored the goal that got the Black Cats promoted, netting in injury time in the Championship play-off final against Sheffield United. His only post-season minutes came in that Wembley showpiece — and he made them count.",
      "",
      "Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)\nWe were reluctant to include players who’ve already spent time on loan in their short careers, but Kroupi is more a new signing than a returning loanee. Signed from Lorient in January, the teenage striker stayed where he was for the remainder of the campaign and helped the club win Ligue 2.",
      "The 19-year-old scored 22 goals in 30 appearances last season to help Lorient win promotion, after scoring five in just over 1,000 minutes in the top flight in 2023/24.",
      "He’s one for the future, and Bournemouth know it, having spent around £10m to sign him in the winter transfer window.",

      "Manchester United are really paying for previous mistakes which has left them unable to copper up for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Send your views on this and all subjects to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Man Utd paying for years of incompetence\nThe chickens are really coming home to roost this summer at United. The problems are too well known and widespread to warrant another yet another email about them but this summer’s transfer struggles are hopefully the natural end point of all of the nonsense of the previous 12 years.",
      "Firstly, United have no cash. Despite a relatively healthy PSR headroom for last FY (which must be healthier now we haven’t bought Mbeumo as expected), by all accounts United are running out of actual money to spend and need to sell to buy. This is a result of what now must be considered generational incompetence in the transfer market and a willingness to hand out extreme wages to players of a questionable age or suitability for Our League.",
      "The result of all this is that we can’t simply go around slapping £5M (add extra 0s where appropriate *cough* Anthony *cough*) extra on the table for any player we are interested in. We also can’t afford to take on big, big wages even where a transfer makes good sense for all involved (Osimhen).",
      "Basically haggling every deal within an inch of its life is the reality for United now. There is clearly frustration that United haven’t agreed or walked away from the Mbeumo deal but it seems to me he’s one of two players the club identified and went for early and were working on a deal that we can afford. There’s no way we’ve been speaking to Brentford for a month and we don’t know what the cost is. No, I think we’ve got our backs to the wall and we’re counting the pennies.",
      "I wonder also if this is holding up sales as well. Sell Garnacho for instance and there’s suddenly not quite as much need to be tight on Mbeumo. Brentford will know that and, to quote Van Der Sar, will challenge us to go as high as we can. That’s the right time to walk away.",
      "And on the subject of sales, that’s a massive clusterf**k. Naive from Amorim and the club to think they could publicly exile these players and expect that teams would still be lining up to sign them. The scarcity of cash and Ratcliffe’s wish to monetise everything at the club should mean that these players are treated like assets.",
      "If you want to get rid then fine but lower the price and move on. If you want to maximise your profit, make them look better than you have. Obviously none of the players have really done themselves any good in a United shirt and their loan spells have been a mixed bag. At the moment, everyone knows they’re overpaid and United are desperate to get rid. Not great conditions for a quick sale.",
      "But of course all these issues stem from past mistakes at the club: the distribution of excessive wages after short term performance (Rashford), terrible planning/negotiating (Anthony) and poor man-management (Sancho – all of them?). As with everything United, it’s systemic.",
      "We’re not going to see a United in the transfer market buying predatorily or selling efficiently until we fix the performance of the squad which we can’t do quickly until we’re better in the market. So it’s going to painful for some time.",
      "Be prepared this summer for no striker, centre mid or goalkeeper. This is just the reality for United now. I can live with it if in five years things have very much improved.",

Ridiculous.",
      "I’ve seen it insinuated so many times lately. I’m not saying they wont be challenging again – I’m sure they will be up there – but every year every team starts afresh. The league starts on zero points. Being 2nd the previous year doesn’t give you some sort of points advantage going into next season.",
      "Arsenal have not won the title the last few years simply because other teams were better than them and they were never as good as they and many others portrayed them to be. Liverpool won it last year because they were the best team from the kick off. And there is nothing to suggest they wont be the best team again next season. But they like everyone else are starting afresh (though obviously for tragic reasons theirs will be a strange and unusual campaign to start with).",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",

      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
