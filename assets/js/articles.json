      "Alejandro Garnacho has been a transfer target of Italian side Napoli for the better part of a year. The Serie A winners saw a £40m bid for the Argentina winger rejected in January.",
      "Then, they were targeting the 21-year-old to replace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, the Georgian star who had just moved to Paris Saint-Germain - where he would become a Champions League winner just five months later.",
      "United of course said no, elected to keep Garnacho despite issues with his attitude and social media posts. After being benched for the Manchester derby victory in December he looked on the way out.",
      "But Garnacho knuckled down, became an important part of Ruben Amorim's side and featured heavily in the second half of the season - until the final weeks.",
      "His Europa League final snub and subsequent reaction were the final straw for Amorim, who duly told Garnacho he had to leave this summer. Now he is one of five players whom the club have told not to return to pre-season training as they seek opportunities away from Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are the others.",
      "Of the quintet, Garnacho is the one for whom United can charge the most. He's youngest of the five, has shown he can cut it at United and doesn't command a £350k-a-week salary like Rashford.",
      "Indeed, his deal is increasingly key for the club's accounts, because his sale equates to pure profit. The current issue however is that while there's been plenty of speculation around potential suitors - Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Napoli and Juventus to name four - none have come forward with an offer.",
      "Indeed, they're looking elsewhere. Chelsea have turned to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund as well as £60m Brighton striker Joao Pedro in recent days, Juventus like Jadon Sancho and have landed Jonathan David in forward positions and now Napoli have turned to £24million PSV Eindhoven star Noa Lang, with an agreement finally reached between the two clubs.",
      "As such, the door on a move to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium for Garnacho appears to have been firmly closed.",
      "United must keep searching for a buyer to give them what they want. But selling Garnacho across Europe this summer is starting to look harder than it previously did.",
      "And if the player was thinking of being the next Scott McTominay, he may need to think again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

He has excelled since moving to The City Ground and, after amassing 17 goal contributions for Forest last season, is now on the verge of another move.",
      "Newcastle are long-term admirers of the Sweden international and have been chasing his signature for weeks in their search for a new right winger.",
      "And with a deal now agreed in principle, United stand to profit from a clause they inserted in the initial deal that took Elanga to Forest two years ago.",
      "As per ESPN, United stand to bank a percentage of any profit Forest make on the amount they signed Elanga for, which is understood to be around £15m.",
      "The Magpies want to strengthen ahead of the 2025-26 campaign after qualifying for the Champions League again and Elanga will give Eddie Howe more frontline options.",
      "Ironically, United's interest in Bryan Mbeumo - and the player's subsequent preference for a move to Old Trafford - drove Newcastle back to Elanga in their search for a new attacker.",
      "Mbeumo is a wanted man after breaking the 20-goal barrier in the Premier League last season but only has eyes for Manchester United. A deal has yet to be finalised for the Cameroon star, though, despite weeks of talks with Brentford.",

Rashford didn't return for pre-season training on Monday like the bulk of United's squad, as he's been granted additional time off to explore a move away.",

      "The Spaniard, who currently plays for Australian side Western Sydney Wanderers, added: \"I saw his first training (session) with us. I love him.",
      "\"As a kid, I called him 'the wonderkid'. The way he played was fearless, you could feel he could win a game by himself at any time when he was playing at his best.\"",

      "Which club should sign Marcus Rashford? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",

Ashworth was a prime target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who had to patiently wait over four months for him to officially commence his role due to being placed on gardening leave by his previous club, Newcastle United.",

While United endured a lacklustre season under Amorim, the Dutchman gradually found his rhythm in defence, sparking hopes among United fans that he will remain a key figure in their backline for years to come.",

I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride.

      "They have a wealth of forwards with Nicolas Jackson also on their books and his disciplinary record - having been sent off at the end of the Premier League season and in the Club World Cup - has made him something of a liability.",
      "Brazil star Pedro can play as a centre striker or wide and his arrival has only increased the likelihood of Nkunku’s departure.",

Victor would certainly be a more affordable option for the Red Devils given he has a £5.8m release clause written into his contract with his current club.",

      "\"There has been interest from clubs in England, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, but John would prefer to play in the best league in the world – the Premier League.

      "After seeing a £45m offer turned down, the Magpies have come back with a £50m bid with up to £5m in add-ons. If Newcastle can finalise an agreement with the Tricky Trees, United could reap the benefits of the sell-on clause they put in place two years ago.",
      "The Red Devils sold Elanga for £15m in 2023 and the Sweden international has thrived since. The Forest winger featured in all 38 Premier League games in 2024/25 and scored six goals and providing 11 assists as the club qualified for the Conference League.",
      "United are reported to hold a clause that entitles them to 15 per cent of any profit Forest make on Elanga. That would see Ruben Amorim's side rake in around £6m if their Premier League rivals do earn a £55m fee.",
      "Personal terms are unlikely to be an issue between player and club, per the Mail. Though Newcastle may yet find rivals for Elanga's signature, with Aston Villa also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "Newcastle, who can offer Elanga the opportunity to play in the Champions League, have a long-term interest in the player. The club failed to land the 23-year-old last summer when an approach was knocked back.",
      "On that occasion, the Tyneside team were willing to pay £45m fee which included an initial £30m payment, a swap deal for Miguel Almiron and two potential further £5m payments. Newcastle could find more success this summer however, and a greater fee for United.",
      "“ There is a lot of talk,\" Elanga said while on international duty last month, per Sport Witness. \"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",
      "“I guess there will always be scouts wherever I play,\" he added. \"As long as I stay focused and do my best in the match.",

      "A total of 15 players reported back to Carrington on Monday morning, including new signings Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, but those who represented their countries on international duty at the end of last season are not expected to return until Thursday.",

      "Onana was linked with a move to French club AS Monaco recently, but has returned to Carrington under the impression he will start the new season as United's No.1.",
      "If that is to be the case, his performances between the posts must improve. Amorim wants a new keeper to compete with the Cameroonian, meaning that should motivate the former Ajax man to raise his game.",
      "With less than 12 months left on his existing deal, it remains to be seen if Casemiro will still be a United player come the end of the transfer window. He has made no secret of his desire to stay, but the absence of European football in 2025/26 could force United's hand.",
      "Casemiro's Europa League performances were excellent in the second half of last term, but his domestic performances left a lot to be desired. He struggled with the speed and the intensity of the Premier League.",
      "No club has so far submitted an offer for the Brazilian. His pre-season performances may also have a decisive say in United's thinking regarding his future.",
      "Signed from Paris Saint-Germain almost a year ago, Ugarte was expected to fix United's midfield woes. Instead, he is not guaranteed a regular starting berth ahead of the new season.",
      "As good as he often was defensively, his ability on the ball was frequently questioned. The Premier League is played at a much quicker tempo in comparison to what he had been used to in France and Portugal.",
      "At the age of 24, Ugarte still has time to improve and adapt, and a first full pre-season at United could help him. But if he is to occupy one of the two central midfield spots come the start of the season, a solid pre-season feels imperative.",
      "It is no secret just how much Amorim admires Mount, meaning there is every chance he could play a very important role in the Portuguese's plans for 2025/26. His United career has been plagued by injuries thus far and he will be determined to make up for lost time.",
      "He offered glimpses of his capabilities towards the end of last season and scored twice in the Europa League semi-final second leg triumph over Athletic Club at Old Trafford. The question everyone will be asking will be can he stay fit? If he can stay injury-free there is every chance he will have a big role to play.",
      "After joining United last summer to operate as a No.9, it quickly became clear that Zirkzee had never been a natural goalscorer. Fortunately for him, he was able to flex his muscles as a No.10 in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "That role suits him down to the ground, so much so he was just getting into his stride when he encountered a hamstring injury in April. However, United have signed Matheus Cunha and hope to add Bryan Mbeumo, meaning United's No.10 options could soon be stacked, limiting Zirkzee's game time.",
      "He is unlikely to have a long-term future at Old Trafford, meaning a sale this summer cannot be dismissed. His pre-season performances may dictate United's thinking.",
      "With the addition of a striker United's top priority this summer, they are prepared to sell Hojlund. He has generated interest from Inter Milan and has also been linked with a move to Napoli.",
      "After a solid first season at United saw him score 16 goals, he regressed last term, scoring just 10. Patience is wearing thin and United desperately need a new No.9.",
      "However, the Dane has not had a full pre-season at the club since arriving from Atalanta nearly two years ago, meaning this summer could be a make or break period for him."

      "Youngsters being sent out on loan is often a staple of any Premier League club's work in the summer transfer window, and it will be no different at Manchester United this summer.",
      "Despite all of the focus naturally being on incomings right now, United cannot lose sight of their long-term future as well.",
      "For all of the club's recent struggles at first-team level, their academy continues to thrive. It has been the birthplace of countless careers down the years and United currently have a conveyor belt of talent looking to follow in their footsteps.",
      "With that in mind, it is crucial United give their next wave of young talent the best possible chance of making the grade. No European football this coming season means fewer games and fewer opportunities for youngsters to potentially catch Ruben Amorim's eye.",
      "It means the club should attempt to arrange a handful of loan moves for some of their most promising youngsters this summer. With that said, MEN Sport has picked out four players who could benefit from getting some first-team experience under their belt.",
      "Goalkeeper Harrison joined non-league side Chester on a season-long loan deal last August, providing him with the opportunity to get some first-team experience under his belt, but it was cut short and he was recalled by United in January.",
      "He impressed during his time at the National League North outfit, keeping seven clean sheets in 18 matches. United recalled him so he could spend the second half of last term training with the first-team and playing for the academy.",
      "He made the bench for the first-team on eight occasions, highlighting that Amorim felt he was ready to step into the breach if required. But with Andre Onana poised to continue as the club's No.1, Tom Heaton tied down to a new deal and a new goalkeeper being targeted, the 19-year-old could struggle for opportunities in 2025/26.",
      "Having impressed in non-league at Chester, Harrison will be hungry to try and prove himself at a higher level, meaning a loan switch to a League Two club, for example, could be in his best interests to aid his development.",
      "Scanlon was nothing short of outstanding for United's Under-18s and Under-21s last season, scoring a combined total of 22 goals across both age settings. He also contributed a respectable seven assists.",
      "Already a regular for Gibraltar's senior team, earning 14 caps, Scanlon is approaching a point in his career where he needs regular first-team football at club level to try and take his development to the next level.",
      "Turning 19 in September, the attacker, who predominantly plays on the left-wing, has trained with United's first-team and was on the bench for the 4-1 Europa League win over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford back in March.",
      "His impressive performances last term could earn him a place on this summer's pre-season tour. Beyond that, though, a loan move would be a sensible idea.",
      "Moorhouse will be attempting to make up for lost time in 2025/26 after a difficult time with injuries last season. Renowned as one of the brightest and most exciting talents in United's academy, the 19-year-old is one to watch.",
      "He featured in both of United's post-season tour friendlies in May, starting the 1-0 defeat to the ASEAN All-Stars, and he offered evidence of being an excellent ball-carrier. He operates in central areas, making him a potentially ideal fit for one of the two No.10 roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Having played just 12 times for the Under-21s last season because of injury issues, United may decide to keep a closer eye on Moorhouse and allow him to continue for the Under-21s at Carrington. But in the event of them being open to sending him out on loan, he would be a smart signing for a number of lower league clubs.",
      "Moorhouse is excellent on the ball and he has the ability to make things happen inside the final third.",
      "Few players in United's academy generated as much attention as Biancheri last season. The striker scored 25 goals for the Under-18s and Under-21s combined, meaning he was the academy's top goalscorer.",
      "Formerly of Cardiff City, the 18-year-old spent time with the Canadian national team at a training camp earlier this summer amid his qualification to represent both them and Wales at international level. However, he is yet to represent Canada at any level.",
      "As far as his club career is concerned, he has already admitted he is open to heading out on loan this coming season and getting some experience under his belt. However, the fact he does not turn 19 until September could mean United keep him for the first half of the season before considering a loan exit in January.",
      "Nevertheless, his goalscoring record at youth level will be appealing to clubs lower down the pyramid, meaning they could be willing to take a punt on him."

      "Manchester United could soon be in line for a timely cash injection as interest in former academy graduate Maxi Oyedele continues to mount.",
      "Oyedele left Old Trafford last August, sealing a surprise permanent switch to Polish club Legia Warsaw. He enjoyed a stellar debut campaign in Poland last term and is now being linked with clubs right across Europe.",
      "The 20-year-old made 24 appearances in his debut campaign at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time. He also helped them reach the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League.",
      "Having made such a telling impression, the former Forest Green Rovers loanee is now being linked with a cluster of clubs, including German outfits Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen.",
      "The defensive midfielder, who can also operate at the back, was sold by United last summer for a small initial fee, which included a substantial future sell-on clause to ensure profit in the event of him making a name for himself in Poland.",
      "It is understood Oyedele has a release clause in his Legia contract worth €6million (£5.18m at the current exchange rate). It has been widely reported that the sell-on clause United inserted into the deal was worth 40 per cent, meaning they stand to bank just north of £2m.",
      "In a summer in which sales are crucial for United to generate money to raise funds for new arrivals, every penny they secure will be welcomed.",
      "United improved their success rate in the seller's market in last summer's transfer window, offloading a crop of players they felt had either run out of time at Old Trafford or were unlikely to ever make the grade.",
      "As was the case with Oyedele's switch to Legia, United inserted sell-on clauses into a several deals that saw youngsters offloaded. Any funds the Reds bank via sell-on clauses will assist them in their efforts to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United also inserted a buy-back clause into the deal that saw Oyedele move to Poland, meaning they have the option to re-sign him. He has also been linked with a return to England amid interest from unnamed Championship clubs."

      "No club should be pressured into getting deals done for the sake of it, especially United, who have been criticised in recent years for paying over the odds for countless players.",

      "If anyone thought Manchester United reaching an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window was a sign of things to come, they have been forced to think again.",
      "After signing Cunha on June 1, United's interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo emerged just over 24 hours later.",
      "It was an early indicator of just how fast the Reds wanted to move at the start of the window and it immediately improved morale among the club's supporters after a forgettable 2024/25 campaign.",
      "But just over a month since they lodged their opening bid for the Brentford attacker, United are yet to reach an agreement with the Londoners for the Cameroon international, who has made it clear that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "After seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down at the start of June, United lodged an improved offer in excess of £60m a few weeks later, and it was understood the deal was close to being finalised.",
      "However, almost a fortnight has passed since then and United are yet to reach a full agreement with Brentford, despite maintaining a degree of confidence that the deal will be done.",
      "United wanted to have Mbeumo signed and in position for the start of their pre-season training preparations. Instead, Diego Leon and Cunha were the only new arrivals present at Carrington on Monday.",
      "United will head to the US for their pre-season tour later this month and head coach Ruben Amorim will be hoping to have the bulk of his transfer business done by the time he and his players fly across the Atlantic. In reality that feels unlikely.",
      "United have prioritised strengthening their attack this summer and news of their interest in Mbeumo was almost immediately applauded. He scored 20 Premier League goals last season and would be an excellent addition.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to occupy the right-sided No.10 role in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after making a habit of drifting inside off the right flank during his time at Brentford. It is believed Cunha has been drafted in to operate in the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "Although it is currently impossible to predict just how United might line up for their season opener against Arsenal next month, Amorim is not short on options in the No.10 positions. Cunha's arrival is expected to see Bruno Fernandes drop into the centre of midfield, leaving Mason Mount, Amad and potentially Mbeumo squabbling over the right-sided No.10 berth.",
      "Amad has proven he is equally effective as a right wing-back or a right-sided No.10 in Amorim's system, but Mount is restricted to one role in the head coach's preferred system. Fortunately for the former Chelsea man, he is held in very high regard by the Portuguese boss.",
      "Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount throughout his United tenure. He shared his admiration for him before even taking charge of United for the first time last November.",
      "If Mount can put his injury struggles behind him, Amorim will have plans to make full use of him this coming season. However, if Mbeumo eventually seals a move to Old Trafford, regular starts may become difficult for the England international to attain.",
      "But with the opening game of United's pre-season campaign now a little over a week away and the club's pursuit of Mbeumo lacking any sort of pace, Mount could find himself in pole position to start against Leeds United in Sweden and attempt to nail down a starting berth ahead of the US tour.",
      "After being consistently lauded by Amorim and bagging a start in the Europa League final in May, Mount will fancy his chances of becoming a key player in his third term at Old Trafford after his first two were ravaged by injuries.",
      "The longer United's pursuit of Mbeumo takes, the stronger Mount's chances of becoming a starter in Amorim's first-choice XI will become."

      "United suffered a bitterly disappointing defeat to Tottenham in May’s Europa League final, failing to capitalise on a last-ditch chance to secure European football for next season. A 15th-place finish in the league also marked the club’s worst showing of the Premier League era.",
      "Still, there are reasons for optimism. Wolves forward Matheus Cunha has become the first new arrival of the summer, and with Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo also a key target, the Red Devils could be set to unveil a completely revamped attacking line next term.",
      "Attention is also turning to the midfield, with GOAL Brazil reporting that Atalanta’s Ederson is once again drawing interest from United’s hierarchy, who have made enquiries about the 26-year-old’s availability this summer. However, the Manchester club are not alone in their pursuit, with both Inter Milan and Juventus also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "The report adds that Atalanta will demand a fee in the region of €60 million (£51.6m) for Ederson during this transfer window and appear more open to selling him than in previous years. Last summer, United were rumoured to be among several clubs, alongside Chelsea and Newcastle, linked with the Brazilian, but the Serie A outfit were unwilling to sanction a move at the time.",
      "Now, after three seasons in Bergamo, Ederson could finally be on the move. Since arriving in Italy in 2022, he has made just shy of 140 appearances for Atalanta in all competitions, scoring 13 goals along the way."

      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived for a fee thought to be in the region of £62.5million, with Ineos set to pay his fee in three instalments over the next three years. Mbeumo's deal from the Bees seems a little more complicated, with Brentford happy to allow the former Troyes man to leave the club, but only for the correct fee.",
      "Having scored 20 goals, last season, what is interesting is exactly how much it will take to see a deal over the line, especially given the increase in his value over the past 12 months. According to Transfermarkt, Mbeumo was priced at just €40million (£34.4million) last summer, with his cost having now skyrocketed to €55million (£47.3million).",
      "It is worth noting that player values provided by the popular data-led site are determined by a community-based system, not an algorithm. Various pricing models are considered, which may not always be accurate, but do give a rough guideline based on multiple factors.",
      "For example, a highlighted fee may be specific to how much a team values the player in comparison to how much he is actually worth in the real-world market. United have been criticised for \"giving in\" to agent fees and club demands over the years, but this is something Ineos, along with sporting director Jason Wilcox, are working hard to avoid moving forward.",
      "Two bids, as mentioned, have already been swatted away by the Bees, ranging from £55million and £62.5million. Now, it remains to be seen if United continue to press on with a third bid in the next week.",
      "All things considered, it does appear likely the Cameroonian will join United this summer - but where Wilcox and even Omar Berrada decide to draw the line on his market value remains unknown."

      "If an agreement for Elanga to join Newcastle does get completed - for the aforementioned price - it would see United receive £8million owing to the £40million profit that Forest would get from the transfer.",

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",
      "He will receive a brilliant reception and it's great to see him enjoying his football again."

      "Manchester United were ostensibly on the up under Erik ten Hag, ending their trophy drought in the Dutchman's first year at the helm and securing a third-place finish in the Premier League. Champions League football was set to return to Old Trafford and there was reason for optimism.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester City were sitting pretty as the kings of England and Europe, with the world crown soon set to follow. A lot has changed since then.",
      "City are in the midst of a squad rebuild having been dethroned as Premier League champions. Pep Guardiola's side are struggling to get back to their imperious best, having scraped qualification for the Champions League and been knocked out of the Club World Cup by Al Hilal.",
      "And then there's United. 15th in the Premier League last season, no European football to look forward and a mishmash of a squad that needs gutting.",
      "The summer transfer window represents a crucial time for two sides looking to send a message to the rest of the Premier League. Outgoings will be as important as incomings, and the two clubs may find themselves in direct competition.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish both enjoyed superb 2022/23 seasons, with the former bagging the first 30-goal haul of his career and Grealish playing a vital role in City's historical treble. Their stock has fallen dramatically since then and both could be on the move this summer.",
      "Rashford has told United he wants to leave and City are searching for a buyer for Grealish. While Rashford and Grealish are two very different players, both forwards will command hefty wages and their respective clubs won't be willing to let them leave for pennies - United want £40m for Rashford and that same figure is claimed to be enough to sign Grealish this summer.",
      "Moving them on isn't going to be easy, and the task will only be made tougher by a club on the other side of the city looking to sell a player who will undoubtedly be linked with the same clubs.",
      "Few could have envisioned Rashford and Grealish being sold a few years ago. Both players needs to find new clubs this summer, but that's easier said than done."

      "“It depends on how bad the manager wants him,” he told Express Sport with Razed. “If they want him that bad, they will end up paying the price and he brings goals at Brentford in what is a tidy side but not a top of the table or top four dominant team that will create more chances than the opposition.",
      "“His record speaks for itself with plenty of goals, chances created, and he has lots of pace to trouble defences in behind. His work rate is really good and he is happy to track back and do the ugly stuff. He will be hungry and is young which is what United need at the moment.”",

However, last month, Sporting Clube de Portugal president Frederico Varandas made it clear that the striker wouldn't be departing for €60million (£51m) plus €10m (£8m) in add-ons, as was previously rumoured.",

      "Sporting are understood to be holding out for a fee in the region of €80million (£69m) for their star player.",

      "Portuguese newspaper A Bola has now suggested that Sporting might be open to negotiating the €80m asking price with 'realistic variables', hinting at a possible €70m (£60m) upfront payment with an additional €10m (£8m) in performance-related bonuses.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to return for pre-season training on Monday, July 7, yet whether he will show up remains uncertain amid speculation in Portugal to the contrary.",

      "‘Upon being informed of the potential arrangement, Amorim — who has experienced a difficult start to life at United — made clear he did not believe such a project to be appropriate or beneficial to the first team at present.

      "Their struggles to sign players is only outstripped by their inability to sell them, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho all so obviously available that no club in their right mind would make an offer this early in the window in the knowledge that United will get desperate as the days tick by.",
      "The only reason to persist with Ruben Amorim after his first few months was to give him a proper pre-season. But Manchester United have failed to deliver.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Manchester United flop Rasmus Hojlund ‘doesn’t want to leave’ the club amid interest from Inter Milan",
      "The Red Devils have so far only managed to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.5m from Cerro Porteno, and are said to currently be focused entirely on prising Bryan Mbeumo away from Brentford.",
      "They’ve seen two bids rejected for the 25-year-old, the latest of which is said to have matched the fee paid for Cunha, with the Bees holding out for £65m for the Cameroon international, who is keen on the move to Old Trafford but perhaps not as desperate as the United bosses would like.",
      "The United bosses missed their own ‘internal deadline’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo on Monday when the players returned to pre-season training, though transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims the Brentford star is still ‘giving priority’ to the move to Old Trafford as ‘talks continue’.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Manchester United’s absolute focus remains on Bryan Mbeumo deal with talks set to continue this week.",
      "‘No agreement with Brentford last week but #MUFC keep working on it and Bryan also keeps giving priority to United move. Deal on.’",
      "But there have been rumours of United interest in other potential new players, with a striker thought to be high on Ruben Amorim’s wish list after Hojlund’s awful return in 2024/2025.",
      "The £64m man managed just ten goals and four assists in 54 appearances for the Red Devils, prompting the club to listen to offers for the striker this summer, with Inter Milan most interested in signing him.",
      "Romano hasn’t ruled out his transfer, but claims it would require United to push for his exit as Hojlund ‘doesn’t want to leave’.",
      "Romano tweeted: ‘Rasmus Højlund doesn’t want to leave Manchester United this summer, his desire is to stay. The only possibility for sale is in case United decide to advance in talks and proceed with his exit. Inter, keen for weeks but deal now in stand-by.’",
      "United have reportedly held talks with Aston Villa over a possible move for Ollie Watkins, though aren’t thought to be willing to pay their £60m asking price, while it was claimed over the weekend that the Red Devils were ‘making a shock move to sign free agent’ Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "The striker has left Goodison Park on a free transfer and the report claimed Amorim ‘wants to snap up Calvert-Lewin as Red Devils chiefs juggle their finances and try to build a new forward line’.",
      "But GIVEMESPORT claim that move is off before it ever really got going as ‘influential figures stopped short of engaging in prolonged discussions due to identifying his injury record as a major red flag when going in search of fresh firepower’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Manchester United have not held talks over the terms Calvert-Lewin is seeking despite being long-term admirers, GMS sources have learned, and they are unlikely to up the ante while there are other targets on the market even though Amorim has been open-minded about securing a goal-getter with a proven Premier League track record.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "Man Utd will look to sell Joshua Zirkzee this summer if their attempts to offload Rasmus Hojlund continue to remain stale, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘politely declined’ the chance to sign a striker who scored just three goals last season, as his club attempted to secure a swap deal for Rasmus ...",
      "Ruben Amorim has chosen between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if Man Utd must sell one. He is also targeting a midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Ethan Nwaneri – Arsenal to Chelsea\nArsenal would be right to be concerned about the prospect of losing Nwaneri given the academy graduate is a year from having his pick of clubs as a free-agent. Nwaneri’s preference is to stay at Arsenal but he wants more minutes. The obvious solution for the teenager is to stay put and reassess over the course of the coming season.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. And Madueke will certainly be cheaper.",
      "",
      "18) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nThe Spain Under-21 midfielder has a release clause worth £87million but United – and other clubs – reckon he’s attainable for a quarter of that sum. Apparently, Guerra is ‘close’ to joining United but we’re not buying it – yet.",

      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nWe’re not sure how many offers West Ham have rejected, but the latest was reportedly worth £50million plus £12.5million in add-ons. West Ham need to sell but they also need to squeeze Spurs for as much as they can given what they make is what Graham Potter can spend.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern were looking for a wide forward even before Jamal Musiala’s injury at the Club World Cup. Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "12) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars who, as expected, are proving stubborn to shift.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nSancho is refusing to leave any of the final year of his United salary on the table, which is making things awkward for everyone. The winger is perfectly entitled to the money in his contract, but Juventus feels like an opportunity he shouldn’t miss if he has any intent to get his career back on track.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were looking for clarity over what a deal for Nunez might involve but, understandably, the transfer market has been the last thing on Liverpool minds over recent days. One of their alternative targets, Ange-Yoan Bonny, has joined Inter so Napoli’s options are more limited.",
      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £20million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year. This will go for as long as Valencia are stubborn.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe noise around this one is increasing, with Madueke perhaps the most achievable left winger target, assuming Eberechi Eze is a separate pursuit. Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and they are expecting an offer from Arsenal. Given the Gunners’ lack of haste this summer, we suggest the Blues don’t hold their breath, but we would certainly keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before this week, with a chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. Having missed their own deadline, there is talk they could walk away, but even United wouldn’t come this far just to ditch it.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man. Lord knows they need a win in the transfer market.",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nReports suggest that Arsenal have made progress but they are yet to reach an agreement with Sporting. There is, apparently, a desire for all parties to get a deal done but for everyone to be satisfied, Arsenal will have to get to £70million. This feels like a saga but, in fairness to the Gunners, what was the hurry before pre-season? That time is now upon us, though…",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry, who bagged 11 goals last season, was flying somewhere prior to the weekend, we assume into Merseyside.",
      "",
      "1) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nArsenal are taking their sweet time to get deals done this summer and Norgaard seems to be the next cab off the rank since a medical is apparently done following a deal being struck worth in the region of £10million.",

      "Arsenal are closing in on the signing of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres. Will he be more Islam Slimani or Bruno Fernandes? We’ve ranked the biggest Premier League signings from the Portuguese top flight.",
      "To avoid a colossal list with every single Liga Portugal signing, we made the cut-off point 20million euros on Transfermarkt, and anyone who turned out to have cost less than £15million after a quick Google search was ditched. That conveniently left us with 30 names, which was pleasing…",
      "30) Fabio Silva (Porto to Wolves, £35.6m)\nWhat a very expensive mistake. Signing Football Manager wonderkids isn’t always a great idea. And yes, he’s still technically a Wolves player.",
      "",
      "29) Lazar Markovic (Benfica to Liverpool, £20m)\nLiverpool were supposed to be signing a wonderkid, but Markovic was anything but; he’s now 31 and without a club after leaving FC Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "",
      "28) Adrien Silva (Sporting to Leicester, £22m)\nLeicester famously missed the deadline to sign Silva in the 2017 summer transfer window by 14 seconds.",
      "He never scored for the Foxes in 21 matches, left for AS Monaco after three years, and didn’t score in 40 matches for the French club. Leicester should have taken that 14-second failure as a sign.",
      "",
      "27) Giannelli Imbula (Porto to Stoke, £18.3m)\nImbula is best remembered for tweeting things like ‘New season how many goals for Imbula’ or simply posting photos of himself playing for Stoke with his name as the caption. He gave Victor Wanyama and Wayne Rooney a run for their money on Twitter.",
      "On the pitch, he couldn’t get anywhere near the dizzy heights of Wanyama. He’s been without a club since February 2024 and as far as we’re aware, Imbula hasn’t yet called time on his career. Despite joining the Potters as one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe, he only played 28 times, scoring twice.",
      "",
      "26) Islam Slimani (Sporting to Leicester, £29.7m)\nSlimani scored 61 goals in 123 games for Sporting – an impressive record but not so fantastic that Arsenal fans should fear Viktor Gyokeres will be just as poor in the Premier League.",
      "In my head, he was awful, but seven goals in 23 Premier League games in 2016/17 says otherwise. That’s hardly an outstanding return, but the fact he didn’t put up numbers to match Niclas Fullkrug in 2024/25 is surprising.",
      "",
      "25) Eliaquim Mangala (Porto to Manchester City, £32m at least)\nAnother iconic Twitter moment is when an Everton fan said this to Mangala during his time on loan: ‘seriously mate no joking please just don’t play again prem not suited to u pal your crap no hard feelings just not worked out @ Mangala’.",
      "Yeah…he wasn’t great. For City or Everton. He’s another one currently a free agent.",
      "",
      "24) Darwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64.2m plus £21.2m in add-ons)\nIt’s just not worked out for poor Darwin at Anfield. The word ‘raw’ has been associated with him since day one, and at 26 years of age, you don’t want to be tagged as ‘raw’. He will almost certainly leave Liverpool this summer after scoring seven goals in 47 matches last season.",
      "MORE: Benfica are the greatest salesmen in football; even Brighton cannot touch them",
      "",
      "23) Nico Gonzalez (Porto to Manchester City, £50m)\nThere’s talk of Nico leaving City already, having only joined for a huge fee in January. If that happens, his ranking will tank.",
      "",
      "22) Fabio Vieira (Porto to Arsenal, £34.2m)\nVieira’s poor physical attributes have caused him to struggle in England. He spent last season on loan back at Porto and it’s anyone’s guess what happens now. Eberechi Eze joining would surely mean the end for him at the Emirates.",
      "",
      "21) Marcos Rojo (Sporting to Manchester United, £16m)\nRojo was quite entertaining, but only because he was a classic, chaotic Argentine. Like a taller, more unhinged, less talented Lisandro Martinez.",
      "",
      "20) Javi Garcia (Benfica to Manchester City, £15.8m)\nTwo-cap Spanish midfielder Garcia joined from Benfica for a respectable fee as Roberto Mancini sought more physicality in his title-winning midfield. He played 76 times for the Cityzens and was a real ‘does a job’ player.",
      "",
      "19) Victor Lindelof (Benfica to Manchester United, £30.7m plus £8.8m in add-ons)\nThe Swedish centre-back was simply ‘meh’ for United, which is not exactly what you want for close to £40million.",
      "",
      "18) Jose Bosingwa (Porto to Chelsea, £16.2m)\nIt’s hard to see Bosingwa’s name without thinking of his studded assault on Yossi Benayoun that didn’t even result in a yellow card. That, and the fact he had a monobrow.",
      "",
      "17) Anderson (Porto to Manchester United, £20m)\nAfter his first season at Old Trafford, Anderson won the 2008 Golden Boy award. He’s a weird one, really. It’s obvious that he didn’t reach the heights expected, but he wasn’t a bad player. Sitting near the middle here feels right.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes (Sporting to Wolves, £38m plus £4.2m in add-ons)\nWolves winning the race to sign highly-rated young midfielder Nunes wasn’t overly surprising given their Portuguese ties through Jorge Mendes, but it was still a coup.",
      "He wasn’t as good as expected but they still sold him for a profit to Man City.",
      "",
      "15) Diogo Dalot (Porto to Manchester United, £19m)\nOverall, this has been a pretty decent signing, and Dalot sitting middle of the road is a good indication that Liga Portugal signings have been pretty successful in Our League.",
      "",
      "14) Evanilson (Porto to Bournemouth, £31m plus £8.5m in add-ons)\nReplacing Dominic Solanke was always going to be tricky, but Bournemouth nailed it with Evanilson. He’s very different, but just as effective up front. The Cherries will hope to repeat the trick when replacing Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "",
      "13) Raul Jimenez (Benfica to Wolves, £30m)\nJimenez’s horrific skull fracture understandably hindered the second half of his Wolves career. His form was never the same, but overall, he was a very good signing.",
      "",
      "12) Ricardo Pereira (Porto to Leicester, £17.5m plus £4.3m in add-ons)\nPereira hasn’t been the same since suffering an ACL injury in March 2019. He’s become very injury-prone and his performances have understandably declined. Before that, though, he was one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. And he wasn’t too expensive.",
      "",
      "11) Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThe huge transfer fee for Fernandez makes him hard to rank, but there’s no doubt he has improved a lot under Enzo Maresca. In truth, he was never rubbish for Chelsea. He barely put a foot wrong, but just didn’t look like a £100m+ midfielder. He still doesn’t – but certainly looks a lot closer to one than before.",
      "MORE: Virgil van Dijk tops ranking of all 17 £70m-plus Premier League signings",
      "",
      "10) Pedro Porro (Sporting to Tottenham, £39.7m)\nSpurs nailed it with this one, even if the signing felt confusing for a while. It felt like Porro was signed as Antonio Conte’s perfect right-wing-back, yet everyone, Conte included, knew he was never going to last in north London.",
      "And then when Ange Postecoglou came in, Porro’s place in the team was uncertain. It quickly became clear that he’s an elite right-back and perfectly fine in a back four.",
      "",
      "9) Ramires (Benfica to Chelsea, £18.2m)\nBenfica must love it when they hear a knock at the door and it’s Chelsea stood there, putting their index fingers together and cutely saying, ‘It’s me again’.",
      "This was a low fee in comparison to Fernandez and friends, but still hugely successful. Best remembered for that chip against Barcelona, Ramires helped the Blues win the Champions League in 2012. He was a brilliantly consistent presence in the midfield with his ridiculous pace and engine.",
      "",
      "8) David Luiz (Benfica to Chelsea, £21.3m)\nChelsea have quite the history when it comes to signing talents from the Portuguese top flight. Luiz’s first spell at Stamford Bridge was between January 2011 and July 2014, when he joined Paris Saint-Germain for over £40m.",
      "Luiz was unpredictable, but that was kind of the charm with him. When PSG paid that huge fee, a lot of people were pretty surprised. Years later, I’m still not sure if he was brilliant or s**t.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Porto to Liverpool, £37m plus £12m in add-ons)\nCurrently wanted by Barcelona and Bayern Munich, the Reds are reluctant to sell Diaz, even if he is very purply patchy, 28 years old, out of contract in two years, and could fetch a significant transfer fee.",
      "While the Colombian has it in him to score once in 15 matches, he also has it in him to score 15 goals in as many games. Don’t turn your nose up at seven assists and 13 goals in a title-winning campaign.",
      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Sporting to Fulham, £20m)\nThe price varies online, but what is for certain is that Palhinha was a huge success at Craven Cottage. And Fulham flipped him to Bayern Munich for a huge profit after two very productive years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson (Benfica to Manchester City, £34.7m)\nAfter sacking off Joe Hart, there were some major goalkeeper teething issues for Pep Guardiola, with Claudio Bravo coming in and performing very unconvincingly.",
      "Guardiola wanted a world-class ball-playing goalkeeper and he signed one in Ederson for a modest fee. He’s been well worth the money, even if errors have been creeping into his game more and more as the years pass by.",
      "",
      "4) Ricardo Carvalho (Porto to Chelsea, £19.85m)\nWhen Jose Mourinho joined Chelsea from Champions League winners Porto in 2004, a few players followed, including Paulo Ferreira and Carvalho.",
      "After playing every minute in the Portuguese club’s Champions League-winning campaign, Carvalho casually helped the Blues romp to a Premier League title after Arsenal went an entire campaign unbeaten, and helped them to a monstrous defensive record of only 15 goals conceded across the 38-game season. If a Premier League record is ageing like a fine wine, it’s that one.",
      "",
      "3) Nemanja Matic (Benfica to Chelsea, £21m)\nChelsea first signed Matic from Slovakian outfit MFK Kosice for pennies in 2009, selling him to Benfica for around £3m two years later. It took the Blues little time to realise they’d messed up and re-signed the Serbian midfielder for big money two-and-a-half years later.",
      "Matic was only 25 when he returned to Stamford Bridge and he quickly became an integral player in Jose Mourinho’s team, which convincingly won the Premier League title in 2014/15.",
      "He was a rock in midfield and scored the occasional banger as well, which is always a nice extra for your ball-winning midfielder to have.\nThere wasn’t much to separate Matic and Carvalho, so the fact the former was sold to Manchester United for around £40m, while the latter only left for around £7m, gives the midfielder the edge.",
      "",
      "2) Bruno Fernandes (Sporting to Manchester United, £47m plus £20.7m in add-ons)\nIt would take some doing to top Fernandes to United, but that’s exactly what’s happened.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has been an incredible player for United and is comfortably their best signing since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "",
      "1) Ruben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £62m plus £3m in add-ons)\nDias quickly became a huge player in City’s defence when he arrived in 2020 and was instrumental in multiple title wins. He walked into the team and instantly became a leader, helping his new club reach the Champions League final and win the Premier League title by 12 points.",
      "He was named FWA Footballer of the Year, Manchester City Player of the Year, Premier League Player of the Season and the UEFA Champions League Defender of the Season in 2021 after an outstanding debut season. He remains a leading Premier League centre-back four years on.",

      "The only reason to persist with Ruben Amorim after his first few months was to give him a proper pre-season. But Manchester United have failed to deliver.",
      "",
      "When Ruben Amorim returned to Carrington on Friday morning he must have wondered whether his pre-summer parting message for Manchester United “to be really strong and to be brave” had been lost in translation.",
      "The deadwood he cut adrift had washed back ashore. The new signings he was promised were not yet delivered. The dumpster fire he abandoned was still raging.",
      "By the most crucial juncture of perhaps the biggest summer transfer window in Manchester United history, five players known to have no future at the club were officially transfer-listed and one release clause was activated.",
      "It is impossible to think this was the “clear picture” Amorim referenced at the end of May, or that he feels this is the best way to “use every minute in every week of pre-season”.",
      "With players reporting for duty on Monday morning, Manchester United are working against the clock and wasting precious time.",
      "Amorim has discussed the importance of pre-season before, the specific lack of which he felt contributed to last season’s struggles.",
      "“I want them to know me in the different ways and not always preparing the match, with stress!” he said in January. “Spending three weeks together, creating something and then you want to create something where you know the players. We do not have the time to do.",
      "“I think that is the secret of teams, even when you have the best players and that feeling, it is really hard to win and I wanted to build something like that here. But we need time for that.”",
      "It is time his employers are already eating into. Matheus Cunha was a fine addition but a straightforward capture even the Ratcliffe brains trust could not bungle, while a predictable inability to sell has hampered any further movement.",
      "Beyond that, deadlines have been set and passed to sign Bryan Mbeumo, with either possible outcome making Manchester United look varying degrees of foolish: if they do not set an overdue precedent by walking away from a deal they feel has been inflated, they must instead meet demands which were never going to be lowered.",
      "Omar Berrada pledged last month to “do our best to do more signings quickly” but the immediate backtrack – “sometimes when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money” – was revealing; Manchester United almost always find the unfathomable third option of taking too long to wrap up signings which become too expensive.",
      "The argument to remain patient with Amorim hinged on him needing a pre-season, and the Portuguese having time and space to work on integrating the players he wants into his fabled system. It was the only reason to persevere with an idea which turned out to be atrocious in practice last season.",
      "That argument collapses in on itself the longer he is given the same squad he has already failed spectacularly with, unless the belief is that Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof were the bad apples causing everything else to rot.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER COVERAGE\n👉 Man Utd set for £30m Greenwood windfall after £60m bid as second signing ‘could be finalised by Monday’\n👉 Man Utd ‘want’ Chelsea star with target to be ‘released’ on one condition; transfer to ‘move quickly’",
      "A few months of acclimatisation might do wonders for Patrick Dorgu’s confidence and capability levels. Diego Leon could hit the ground running as a teenager playing and living outside of Paraguay for the first time in his life. There may happen to be some ludicrously talented wing-backs, centre-forwards, goalkeepers and holding midfielders in the Academy waiting to emerge.",
      "But Manchester United cannot afford much in their current state, let alone relying on possibilities, suppositions and estimations.",
      "They need guarantees and certainties, absolutes and assurances. That is why the return of an old transfer policy made complete sense in early June but the longer the current situation drags into July, the more impeded Amorim’s start – already far further back than first anticipated – will be.",
      "Cunha alone cannot hope to galvanise and refresh this group with his mere presence. The spectres of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony still linger. The sense that Manchester United are entirely incapable of negotiating more than one transfer at a time persists.",
      "Making Mbeumo a priority target is one thing but other opportunities are going unexplored. The instinct might be to raise an eyebrow at the reported pursuit of Dominic Calvert-Lewin but a free agent with substantial experience and no settling-in period in a position Manchester United must reinforce at least makes sense without being particularly inspiring.",
      "Yet not every signing needs to come with a statement, not every purchase must send a message. Sensible squad building requires far more cost-effective deals than it does extravagant ones, even if they cannot feed the ego quite as emphatically.",
      "And that ego will almost certainly need to take a hit over the valuation of the players they openly wish and need to sell before buying. As Berrada put it, there is a need to “balance the books”.",
      "But he also said “we’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting,” and the only way to make such a risible defence of widespread redundancies and ludicrous cutbacks more shameful is to squander that apparent place of strength.",
      "“I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into,” he added, and they might well do. But the point was only ever to give Amorim a stronger team to work with to maximise his “secret” weapon of pre-season.",
      "Manchester United have failed on that count already. Their first friendly is in 12 days before they fly out to the United States for a tournament which bleeds into August. Every minute ticking away with neither a signing nor a sale feels like part of the countdown to Amorim’s demise rather than the start of his great rebuild.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: ‘Bryan Mbeumo deal done’ as Ruben Amorim role misunderstood",

      "Manchester United are desperately trying to find buyers for their outcasts to raise funds for what currently looks set to be a woefully inadequate summer rebuild.",
      "We’re not quite sure if there’s more or less hope of members of the bomb squad joining clubs under former managers or assistants, but we’re going with it. Here are eight possible reunions the Red Devils chiefs will be begging for this summer.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho – Besiktas\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has ‘asked about the conditions’ required to bring him to Turkey after Juventus predictably pulled out of a potential swap deal over excessive wages that continue to screw Sancho, United and pretty much every other player they’re currently trying to get off their books while offering similarly extortionate salaries to new signings having clearly failed to learn their redundancy-forcing lesson.",
      "So yeah, the conditions are a £25m transfer fee and a £300,000-per-week wage, or a small loan fee and a great reduction in that wage when United get desperate towards the end of the window and are forced to subsidise his exit. Probably wait for that.",
      "",
      "Tyrell Malacia – Feyenoord\nAs miserable Manchester United footballers go – and there are over 30 of them to choose from – we would suggest Malacia is among the most downcast.",
      "“I can promise the United fans that I will leave everything on the pitch every time I pull on the red shirt,” he said when Erik ten Hag signed him in 2022. And we don’t doubt that he has, he’s just not good enough and him being injured or on loan for the majority of his three years as a Red Devil has probably been a blessing.",
      "A spell at PSV Eindhoven last term didn’t pan out and here’s hoping Rene Hake – Ten Hag’s assistant at United; now assistant at Feyenoord – can persuade the club where Malacia made his name to take what would be an inexpensive punt on the full-back.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho – Bayer Leverkusen\nLike Amorim, Ten Hag had the occasional off-field issue with Garnacho, but unlike Amorim, the Dutchman maintained a supportive stance throughout their time together at Old Trafford, citing his age and trajectory to excuse the Argentinian’s ill-advised social media activity while doing everything possible to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "Garnacho went from an unknown to a player linked with £70m transfers in their time together a the club, so Ten Hag was doing something right.",
      "He wants an opportunity to continue forging that relationship now he’s pitched up at Bayer Leverkusen, who have both money to spend and a creativity dearth to make up for following Florian Wirtz’s move to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford – Arsenal\nHe’s not being ousted by Manchester United because he’s crap, but because – rightly or wrongly – Ruben Amorim sees him as a poor influence on the dressing room.",
      "In a squad so clearly all pulling in the right direction under Mikel Arteta, we can’t see him being an issue, and we’re not convinced by the logic of gifting Chelsea another £50m to sign a guy with the potential to be Rashford when the actual Rashford is available for £40m.",
      "We get that Arsenal have been burned by the signing of Raheem Sterling last summer, but it was nothing a few minutes under the cold tap wouldn’t sort, and Rashford’s a very different case.",
      "There was little evidence of there being much left of the Sterling who scored goals for fun at Manchester City when the Gunners took him on loan, while it was clear in six months at Aston Villa that Rashford remains a potentially world-class adjacent winger, as he was when Gunners assistant Albert Stuivenberg was working under Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford.",
      "In the right environment he could do the business to drive a team like Arsenal to major silverware, and not in one or two seasons, as may be the case with Noni Madueke, but next season, when it’s do or die for Arteta.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood – Fenerbahce\nIt was Solskjaer who handed Greenwood his United debut but Jose Mourinho called him up to train with the first team some two years after he was denied that same request as regulations ruled out the 15-year-old’s participation – he was well aware of the striker’s quality and it was claimed last month that the Portuguese boss had requested Fenerbahce bosses to look into his signing.",
      "A report on Sunday claimed Al-Ahli have ‘submitted an offer of £60m’ for Greenwood, which will be music to Manchester United ears after club bosses displayed out-of-character cunning by inserting a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal which saw him move to Marseille for £23m last summer.",
      "Whether Greenwood will be attracted by the ludicrous wages remains to be seen, but if he wants more of a balance between pay packet and football quality then a move to Turkey may be in the offing, and Fenerbahce’s big-money move for Jhon Duran shows their desire this summer to close what has been an increasing gap to Galatasaray.",
      "MORE MAN UTD NEWS ON F365\n👉 Insiders claim Man Utd have made ‘surprise move’ for a former Everton star in ‘new transfer reality’\n👉 Man Utd set for £30m Greenwood windfall after £60m bid as second signing ‘could be finalised by Monday’\n👉 Solskjaer ‘asks about conditions’ to sign exiled Man Utd star with Juventus swap ‘a non-starter’",
      "",
      "Antony – Bayer Leverkusen\nTen Hag wanted Antony at Old Trafford having worked with him at Ajax but actually warned the club against spending £85m on the winger, presumably because he worked with him at Ajax.",
      "He wouldn’t need anywhere near that much to reunite with him in the Bundesliga, which may be another league well suited to the 25-year-old, who’s thrived in La Liga after impressing in the Eredivisie.",
      "We don’t even really know if the Premier League was the problem, or – as has been the case for multiple players on and off this list – the problem is in fact just Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Casemiro – Al Nassr\nCristiano Ronaldo isn’t technically the Al Nassr manager, but actual manager Jorge Jesus will be under no illusions as to who’s making the transfer decisions after CR7 signed his new £488,000-per-day contract while any rumour leads on Ronaldo ‘pushing’ or ‘urging’ so-and-so’s signing.",
      "Casemiro was a dead-man walking for over a year at Old Trafford with United not just opening doors but baking pies to entice buyers for the Brazilian, but after an uptick in his displays at the end of the season led to an international recall he now wants to see out his contract in the hope of heading to the 2026 World Cup.",
      "United would still welcome what would be a hefty transfer fee and to have his mammoth wages off the books; all they need is a call from Ronaldo and a promise from Carlo Ancelotti to see the back of him.",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw – Ajax\nWe were of course tempted by the thought of Mourinho laying on some sort of mobility scooter/cart to lug Shaw through Istanbul Airport in a bid to further fat-shame the full-back after signing him for Fenerbahce, but we’re guessing the Englishman probably doesn’t fancy putting himself through that trauma no matter the tax-free riches he would receive in the Turkish Super Lig.",
      "Van Gaal, who signed him from Southampton for United in 2014, also criticised Shaw’s fitness when he first arrived at the club, but the left-back later insisted Van Gaal “helped me a lot” and was a “great manager”.",
      "The Dutchman is now an ‘advisor’ at Ajax, who opened their doors as a sanctuary for past-it England stars last year when Jordan Henderson joined after his morally reprehensible spell with Al-Ettifaq.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘gained strength in recent hours’ in the Barcelona offices and no, it’s not poor old Marcus Rashford.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer has been ‘approved’, while the Red Devils ‘want to sign’ a 27-goal striker.",
      "According to reports, one key issue is preventing Manchester United from completing a double deal worth around £65m in a triple blow for the Red Devils.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is ‘getting closer’ to completing a move to La Liga giants Barcelona this summer, according to reports.",
      "‘Barcelona want to try again for Marcus Rashford’ after missing out on Nico Williams and with a move for Luis Diaz now ‘very unlikely’.",
      "Marcus Rashford is ‘determined’ to join Barcelona this summer and will ‘make significant effort to facilitate’ a transfer, according to reports."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £61.7m\nThe Black Cats made Noah Sadiki their third summer signing and are far from finished following promotion to the Premier League.",
      "",
      "8) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "6) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper has propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is ‘getting closer’ to completing a move to La Liga giants Barcelona this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rashford left Old Trafford in the January transfer window as Aston Villa took him on loan for the remainder of the season after a falling out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Man Utd forward was directly involved in ten goals in 17 matches at Villa Park in a successful loan spell that has once again boosted his reputation around Europe, to the delight of the Red Devils.",
      "It is clear that Rashford has to leave this summer unless there is an incredible U-turn from Amorim, who publicly stated in January that he’d rather play his goalkeeper coach than the Man Utd forward.",
      "When asked why Rashford wasn’t being selected, Amorim replied in a press conference: “It’s always the same reason: the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It’s every day, every detail.",
      "“If things don’t change, I will not change. It’s the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.",
      "READ: Ranking Marcus Rashford’s transfer options: Barcelona? Arsenal? Aston Villa return?",
      "“You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench. But I would put [Man Utd goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "Amorim did admit that he was “really happy” to see Rashford doing well on his loan spell, he commented in April: “All players on loan will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season. The talent of Rashford, Antony… we are really happy because if you put players on loan you want them to perform.”",
      "But there is no future for Rashford at Old Trafford while Amorim in charge with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano explaining over the weekend that the Man Utd forward is now “waiting for options”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Marcus Rashford is basically waiting for options, including Barcelona. Rashford would love to go to Barcelona. Rashford would love to play in Spain. Would love to be a Barca player. Would love to play with Barca players. So Rashford is basically waiting for this option.",

      "Football Insider‘s senior correspondent Pete O’Rourke claims that the only way Rashford moves to Barcelona is on another loan deal.",
      "O’Rourke told Football Insider: “Rashford’s on a very lucrative contract which he doesn’t want to give up.",
      "“Rashford has got this dream scenario of joining Barcelona, but the way that deal’s going be done, it could only be a loan because of Barcelona’s ongoing financial issues and issues registering players.",
      "“These players are due to return to pre-season training at Manchester United next week, but in an ideal world, Ruben Amorim will not want them there.",

      "A deal to sign Liverpool’s Luis Diaz is ‘becoming increasingly difficult’ and Rashford is ‘ready to do anything to wear the Blaugrana next season’.",
      "Rashford ‘is gaining points to be Barça’s future signing’ with the England international ‘willing to substantially reduce his salary’ in order to complete the transfer.",
      "The Man Utd forward ‘believes the best place to develop is at Barça, alongside Lamine Yamal, to earn a place in the England squad for next summer’s World Cup’.",

      "They’ve seen two bids rejected for the 25-year-old, the latest of which is said to have matched the fee paid for Cunha, with the Bees holding out for £65m for the Cameroon international, who is keen on the move to Old Trafford but perhaps not as desperate as the United bosses would like.",

      "A report from the same publication last week claimed United are ‘always vigilant’ over former Everton striker Moise Kean and that the Red Devils ‘are regularly in touch to monitor the situation of the 2000-born player’.",
      "In 44 appearances for Fiorentina last season, Kean racked up an impressed 25 goals and three assists, and that report claimed United are ‘one of the favourites’ to sign Kean and ‘the charm of the Premier League and Old Trafford could tempt the former Juventus player, who would also be guaranteed a top player’s salary’.",
      "Kean has a release clause of £44m which previous reports have suggested United were considering triggering in a bid to beat Saudi Pro League clubs to his signing, but it’s now claimed they could pay that fee in two instalments, making the transfer even more appealing to the cash poor Premier League side.",
      "‘Based on leaks from Fiorentina, it’s possible to pay the clause in two instalments. So, anyone who wants to buy Kean can spread the payment’, the report states.",
      "That news may well be a timely boost for Red Devils fans, who are faced with the reality of their club missing their own ‘internal deadline’ to sign Mbeumo, assuming the deal isn’t done late on Sunday night or in the early hours of the morning before they begin pre-season training on Monday.",

      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",

      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",

      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Kyle Walker is ‘close’ to completing a ‘shock’ move to a rival Premier League club in a ‘significant coup’.",
      "A former Chelsea defender has offered his thoughts on Liam Delap, suggesting he ‘can shine’ with the help of ‘elite’ players like Cole Palmer.",
      "Joao Pedro has joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m. Will Alexander Isak be among them soon?",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
