      "Manchester United aren't accustomed to taking their lead from Liverpool, but Ruben Amorim may do just that by swerving a move to sign Christopher Nkunku. The Frenchman is believed to be up for sale this summer after falling afoul at Chelsea, with the Red Devils among those said to be interested.",
      "The Telegraph reported on Monday that United and Chelsea are \"weighing up\" a potential swap deal involving Nkunku and Alejandro Garnacho. Both players have seen their stock plummet at their respective clubs of late, with each being touted to move in the coming months.",
      "Garnacho, 20, fell out with Amorim towards the end of this season when he was dropped for key clashes against Tottenham and Aston Villa. And the Argentina international appears to have hinted he's ready to leave after posting an image of himself wearing a Villa jersey with Rashford's name and number on the back, having spent part of this term on loan in Birmingham.",
      "Nkunku, 27, had lofty ambitions after he joined Chelsea from RB Leipzig in 2023 for an eye-bulging £52million. However, the France international wouldn't be expected to fetch the same fee today despite scoring 14 times in 22 starts this season.",
      "His career in England may have panned out differently had the boardroom brains at Anfield got their way. The Reds recruitment team identified Nkunku as a likeable target during his time in Germany.",
      "However, The Times reported Klopp stepped in to insist his side signed Darwin Nunez from Benfica instead. The manager got his wish, though many might wonder if Nkunku would have been the superior signing given Nunez's struggles in front of goal.",
      "And Amorim, 40, could conduct a similar hijack as United step up their interest in Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo. That's after seeing an initial offer of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rebuffed by the Bees.",
      "The Red Devils have now returned with a second bid totalling £60m for the Cameroon international. Amorim has already added Brazil international Matheus Cunha to his squad this summer but appears adamant to continue strengthening his options in attack.",
      "Despite missing out on European qualification for the coming campaign, United's spending power doesn't appear to have been dented as badly as some predicted. Or at least the club isn't shying away from lavish expenses, confident in their ability to balance the books via other means.",
      "Amorim hasn't wasted much time in attempting to put his own imprint on the team during his first summer window at the Old Trafford helm. And adding Mbeumo to his selection would represent another statement signing given the player could well hold out for a team playing among Europe's elite next season.",
      "Any pursuit of Nkunku could be seen as more appealing given the implication that it would help offload Garnacho. However, that would still require a significant piece of negotiation as the two deals would have to be treated individually, rather than a straight swap.",
      "In any case, United's follow-up bid for Mbeumo appears to suggest he has caught Amorim's eye as the more desirable target. And if that is the case, it would illustrate the Portuguese's powers of persuasion, not unlike former Liverpool boss Klopp."

The Dutchman has shot out of the gate when it comes to signings after leading the club to the Premier League title in his first season in charge.",
      "The Reds have already acquired Armin Pecsi from Puskas Akademia and Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz, with the latter being signed for £100million plus add-ons of £16m. With Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez also nearing a move to Anfield, it's been a busy window at Liverpool thus far for arrivals as Slot looks to match that business in regards to departures.",
      "As Jarell Quansah closes in on a £35m to Leverkusen, the Reds could part ways with the likes of Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz, Harvey Elliott and Andy Robertson as Slot continues building the team in his image.",
      "An overhaul of that many first team starters could be classed as being overwhelming for a head coach but Slot certainly has experience in the area, having carried out a similar strategy after his first season at Feyenoord.",
      "After finishing third in his debut campaign with the Eredivisie giants, Slot sold several of his starters including Tyrell Malacia to Man United and Luis Sinisterra to Leeds. He also sold defender Marco Senesi to Bournemouth while league top scorer Guus Till ended his loan spell before signing for rivals PSV.",
      "Despite the departure of several of his big hitters, Slot's recruitment and coaching saw Feyenoord go on to win their first league title in five years. The 46-year-old has made no qualms about only requiring the best players possible to play for Liverpool thanks to the standard set by Mohamed Salah.",
      "Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"If you want to play for Liverpool, you need to be at Mo Salah level. If you’re not at his level, you are almost useless to play at this club, we only need players at the top of their game. Why? Because this is one of, if not the best club in the world to play for!\"",
      "Despite the significant business already completed by Liverpool, the club continue their search to strengthen further with Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi and Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike reportedly liked by Anfield chiefs.",
      "The Reds' deal for Wirtz has the potential to be the biggest the Premier League has ever seen with the fee and add-ons coming out to £1m more than the £115m Chelsea paid for Moises Caicedo.",
      "Speaking after the move was completed, the German superstar told the club's official website: \"I feel very happy and very proud. Finally it’s done and I was waiting for a long time – finally it’s done and I am really happy.",
      "\"I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.",
      "\"Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I'm really ambitious. I'm not coming [to] have fun here, I want also to achieve something and give the fans what they deserve.\"",

      "Manchester United have been linked with Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, who has come up against Premier League defenders in the past. The Serbian striker was signed for £60million from Fiorentina in 2022, but could be on his way out of Turin this summer.",
      "Vlahovic, 25, scored 16 goals across all competitions for the Old Lady this season. He has since been touted as a target for United as Juventus reportedly explore a possible swap deal for Jadon Sancho.",
      "The winger is set to enter the final year of his United contract and is not thought to be in manager Ruben Amorim’s plans after his Chelsea loan spell failed to materialise into a permanent move. However, if Vlahovic does join the Premier League as part of a swap deal, he will hope to perform better against England defender Marc Guehi, who is wanted by Liverpool.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has claimed that Juventus are willing to offer players in exchange for Sancho, who is also said to be on Napoli’s radar. Vlahovic has been named as one option and former Aston Villa star Douglas Luiz is said to be another alternative.",
      "Vlahovic has been described as ‘unreceptive’ to previous offers to leave Juventus, having attracted interest from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. However, the chance to lead the line for United could convince the forward.",
      "He has limited experience against English clubs, scoring in a Champions League group stage win over Manchester City in November. However, Vlahovic did line up for Serbia against England in their opening game at Euro 2024, where he endured a tough evening against Guehi.",
      "The centre-back was selected by Gareth Southgate to replace the injured Harry Maguire, despite his relative inexperience at international level. Crystal Palace captain Guehi stepped up to the challenge and appeared composed alongside John Stones as the Three Lions earned a 1-0 win.",
      "Vlahovic, partnered by ex-Fulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic, barely had a touch in the first-half as England stifled Serbia’s physical front two. It proved to be a landmark performance from Guehi, who has since attracted interest from Liverpool.",
      "The Palace defender is another who is set to enter the last 12 months of his deal after failing to agree to a new contract with Oliver Glasner's side. Reluctant to let one of their prize assets leave for free next year, the FA Cup winners are expected to sell Guehi this summer.",
      "Liverpool have expressed interest in Guehi this summer as they look to bolster their centre-back options. Arne Slot's side are searching for a central defender following Jarell Quasah’s move to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Palace have set a £50m asking price for Guehi, according to talkSPORT. Liverpool have already been busy in the transfer market after agreeing deals for Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez.",
      "Meanwhile, as United consider Sancho’s future, the club have also begun rebuilding their team. Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves and the club have improved their offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United's summer so far has been a lot of talk but far less action. Ruben Amorim knows he needs a big few months if he is to be a success at Old Trafford.",
      "The less said about last season's Premier League effort the better, but the man in the dugout now has the chance to address any issues and have a full pre-season getting his ideas across. The last few months and their results underlined the need for new faces in Manchester.",
      "Many have been linked but so far only Matheus Cunha has signed. His arrival was made far easier by a release clause that existed in his Wolves contract - although which leaves United paying the cash faster than they would have preferred. However, trying to persuade other clubs to sell up has proved a lot harder.",
      "The Europa League final defeat also means that the Manchester outfit cannot offer European football of any kind, which will deter some players from moving. Already Liam Delap has opted for Chelsea instead of the Red Devils.",
      "Adding more firepower appears to be a priority whilst almost every player on their books is potentially up for sale. Amorim's unique system requires certain players to make it tick and those are the ones he's targeted, whilst he also has a number of big name individuals who needs to have their futures wrapped up.",
      "The likes of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are back in Manchester, but for how long? Alejandro Garnacho is edging closer to the exit door with his potential departure likely to fund their summer business as clubs in the Premier League and abroad weigh up bids.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is currently the main man on United's radar. They've just made another bid, this one worth a total £60million. Brentford are holding out for £65m, wanting a little more that it cost to land Cunha due to him being younger and having scored more than the Brazilian last term, while knowing that Tottenham are also waiting in the wings.",
      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best year in front of goal and the Bees have proved that they are a selling club. The disparity between United's bid and Brentford's asking price is minimal, which all points to a deal getting done. The only potential sticking point is the structure of the deal with the west Londoners not wanting instalments.",
      "United though want their man and are unlikely to miss out over such a detail. Amorim wants it done and dusted before pre-season training begins on July 7.",
      "Rashford will soon be back in the building after several months away with Aston Villa. It became clear when Amorim rocked up that he and the England star weren't at all aligned with the United boss claiming he couldn't get the player to see football the way he does.",
      "The forward was impressive whilst at Villa but they haven't exercised their option to sign him for £40m. It leaves Rashford in limbo and whilst he's claimed he could play as a No.9, the transfer activity at Old Trafford suggests they feel they need to improve in that area and will look outside the club, not within, for their options.",
      "But what now for Rashford? Well the dream Barcelona switch looks to be off the cards as they move for Nico Williams of Atletico Madrid instead. They're also taking the Copenhagen kid Ronny Bardghji.",
      "Any suitor who comes in will want him to lower his wages and probably won't want to be paying United anything like they're looking for. But currently there isn't a huge amount of noise regarding a buyer and the player is very much stuck in limbo.",
      "Speaking of outside noise, the talk of Andre Onana leaving Manchester won't go away. The Cameroonian has now spent two years at the club but is yet to convince. The constant errors even saw Amorim drop him for a game last term and Monaco as well as clubs in Saudi Arabia are thought to be keen.",
      "United could therefore be on the lookout for a new goalkeeper and the Emiliano Martinez links continue to persist. The Argentine cut an emotional figure at the end of the season with Villa, many seeing it as possible goodbye. Atletico Madrid are keen but United are also waiting in the wings. Gianluigi Donnarumma, the PSG No.1, is, right now, frankly not going to happen.",
      "Sancho, like Rashford, was out on loan last term but unlike his team-mate a pathway back to Manchester appears a lot less likely. His loan to Chelsea came after he also had a stint back at Borussia Dortmund. Throughout his time at Old Trafford he's rarely looked like a £70m player.",
      "But like so many on the books his wages and the price demands make his exit particularly difficult. Juventus are among those to be linked as are Napoli, but none will be paying £25m plus £350k-a-week. The fee United could get, but they're likely going to need to negotiate a pay-off with Sancho to get him off the books.",
      "Italy could also be the destination for Rasmus Hojlund, who has underwhelmed in his two years with the club. Despite his lack of goals Inter Milan are keen and could offer him a route out of the club, but United won't get anywhere near to recouping the £72m they spent to sign him.",
      "Once tipped as the future of the club, Garnacho has fallen down the pecking order. He's struggled to find a home in Amorim's system and his attitude hasn't endeared him to his manager. He reacted when left out of the team for the Europa League final and an exit now appears to suit all parties - with fans increasingly frustrated by some of his social media antics.",
      "Of all the assets United are likely to sell the Argentine is perhaps the most valuable. He would command a hefty fee and Napoli have been linked. Now Chelsea have come to the party and a swap deal, maybe involving Christopher Nkunku, is a possibility. Wherever he goes Garnacho will either bring in a good amount of cash to re-invest or prove to be a tempting option in a swap.",
      "But the thing is, he's obviously talented, has huge potential, can score goals and is dynamic - things Amorim wants from his attackers. He was a regular for the Portuguese for much of last season, so could he still have a future in Manchester?",
      "It's a decision that still needs to be made - from all sides.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Tottenham Hotspur are offering the opportunity of a reunion with Thomas Frank, after he left Brentford for the Europa League winners, replacing Ange Postecoglou. They have already made an offer totalling a potential £70m.",

      "Negotiations between the clubs are ongoing, and while they do, Mbeumo has taken to social media to share his holiday activities. He uploaded a series of photos and videos on Instagram, declaring: \"Time off so far\".",
      "Mbeumo experienced Roland Garros as well as a scenic trip to Canada, where he was interviewed during a trip to the F1's Canadian Grand Prix. One person to notably like Mbeumo's post was United's young defender Leny Yoro.",
      "Certainly Ruben Amorim would like to have Mbeumo in situ by the time the Premier League kicks off in August. United host Arsenal at Old Trafford in their opening fixture.",
      "And the Portuguese is desperate to overhaul his misfiring attack after their dismal showing in 2024-25. Brazil international Cunha is a start, while Mbeumo has been earmarked as his 'twin No.10' counterpart in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation. A move for a new central striker has also been earmarked.",
      "Pre-season is looming for Amorim, who is aiming to bring about significant change after the club's worst Premier League season, since the competition's inception in 1992. Their domestic disaster was compounded by defeat in the Europa League final to Spurs - which ensured there will be no European football at the club next term.",
      "United's players are due to return to pre-season on July 7 before heading on tour to the USA. Whether Mbeumo is among their number remains to be seen.",

      "\"Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it's quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as the lone No. 9 waiting for service.

      "Liam Delap has revealed he spoke with former team-mate Cole Palmer before deciding to join Chelsea for £30million.",
      "Delap joined Enzo Maresca's men despite strong interest from Manchester United and quickly wrapped up a move from Ipswich Town in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "The forward has already made his first two appearances for the club against Los Angeles FC and Flamengo and is hoping to become Chelsea's first choice forward in the 2025-26 season.",
      "Delap has spoken about what influenced his decision to move to Stamford Bridge despite huge interest in his signature and said Palmer - who came through the ranks with him at Manchester City - was a big help in making his decision.",
      "\"Yeah I spoke to him a little bit,\" he said, as reported by ESPN. \"Asked him what I needed to ask him. He told me what I needed to know. I don't like too much information.",
      "\"Ultimately it was my decision so I kind of just want my head to be clear so not too much. [I've known him] since I was 15, playing at City with him. I've got a good relationship with him so it was nice to see a familiar face.",
      "\"There are so many factors that go into it. I've got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "Palmer made the move from City to Chelsea and has become one of the first names on the team-sheet. He scored 22 goals and assisted 11 in his first season before netting another 15 and assisting eight in his second campaign.",
      "Delap is hoping to emulate the midfielder by also making a fast start to life in west London, having scored 12 Premier League goals last season.",
      "\"Of course, that's the goal,\" Delap said. \"I think we both had similar positions and he's gone and smashed it so hopefully I can also.",
      "\"I think he's always been that good and everyone at City will tell you that. The rate he's done it at is incredible. But I think ultimately it was always going to happen.\"",
      "Delap is still only 22 and will now be looking to stamp his mark on the Premier League after his first season in the top flight with the Tractor Boys ended in relegation. He previously played six senior games for City before loan moves to Stoke, Preston and Hull before joining Ipswich for £20m last summer.",

      "As a result, the club’s finances took a huge hit, with some believing funds for the summer would be limited. But United have tried to not let that affect them.",
      "They have already splashed £62.5m on former Wolves forward and Brazilian international Matheus Cunha. It is hoped that he could be the first attacking addition of the summer as Amorim attempts to solve his side’s goalscoring woes.",
      "And United already have their eyes on a few more. With that being said, take a look at what the starting XI could look like against Arsenal on the opening day of next season:",
      "Let’s start in the obvious place - in goal. There could potentially be a change ahead of next season. Andre Onana has failed to convince since his arrival from Inter Milan, with Monaco eyeing a swoop for the Cameroonian.",
      "And should he be allowed to leave, United could move for Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma, who sees his contract expire in a year. He has already reportedly been discussing a move to the Premier League with his Italian colleagues.",
      "While United committed to a significant outlay last term in signing Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt to bolster their defence, there could yet be more signings. Youngster Diego Leon is on the way, while it has been reported that Sporting Lisbon star Ousmane Diomande is keen on being reunited with Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Who else should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "And United could potentially do with another defender following the exits of Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof. Should Diomande be signed, he could potentially replace Lisandro Martinez in the heart of the defence, with the Argentine expected to be sidelined until September. Patrick Dorgu should retain his position at left wing-back, but it'll be interesting to see if its Diogo Dalot or Amad on the right moving forwards.",
      "Moving into midfield, the Red Devils’ line-up seems pretty well set. Last summer’s signing Manuel Ugarte should do enough to usurp Casemiro, while captain Bruno Fernandes is a near guarantee to start after spurning interest from Saudi Arabia. Given Christian Eriksen has departed, another signing in midfield might be useful but not crucial.",
      "It’s really in attack where United will go through a real transformation. A number of forwards are already on the chopping block with loanees Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all expected to leave permanently. They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund, who have both been linked with moves to Italy.",
      "Of course, a deal for Matheus Cunha is already over the line and he could soon be followed by Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star is United’s next attacking target and he is already keen on a move to Old Trafford despite late competition from Tottenham.",
      "And then leading the line could potentially be current Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku. Reports have suggested that United are already in talks regarding a potential deal and he could potentially slot straight into the side should a deal progress.",

      "It was noticeable during Omar Berrada's first summer as Manchester United chief executive that the club never broke the £60million barrier for a signing.",
      "For years, Berrada's former employers at Manchester City privately bragged that they seldom spent more than £60m on a player. Jose Mourinho felt he was on a hiding to nothing against a state-backed club but it was a matter of quality more than quantity with City.",
      "To date, City have spent in excess of that figure on only four players: Rodri, Ruben Dias, Jack Grealish and Josko Gvardiol. Grealish is the sole failure and his best season still coincided with City's treble triumph.",
      "Leny Yoro was United's most expensive acquisition last year for an up front fee of £52.18m. The deal could total £58.91m.",
      "Already this summer, United have crept above the £60m mark for Matheus Cunha, who had a reasonable release clause of £62.5m. Bryan Mbeumo, who outscored Cunha and everyone else in the Premier League bar Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Mohamed Salah, could fetch an identical fee.",
      "That is the going rate for a Premier League-standard forward. Only one of United's five arrivals last year was an attacker and Joshua Zirkzee also had a release clause. He was based in Italy, whose league has been in decline for nearly two decades and has become a dumping ground for English clubs. Ie. not United material but nearly as economical as Jasprit Bumrah's bowling.",
      "Sensibly, United have sought forwards with Premier League pedigree this year. Liam Delap was another they wanted on board and the eventual identity of their new No.9 (to consider Cunha or Mbeumo as one would be a complete cop-out) will be curious as it is unlikely to be a domestic deal.",
      "Before he purged his Twitter account, Berrada revelled in how much United had overpaid for Angel di Maria in 2014. Di Maria, a reigning Champions League winner who had recently helped Argentina to reach the World Cup final, commanded a British-record £59.7m fee.",
      "The problem with Di Maria was not the fee but the fact that he did not want to move to Manchester. United had a free run as Paris Saint-Germain, Di Maria's preferred choice, were out of the running due to financial fair play issues.",
      "Di Maria effectively covered the cost of James Rodriguez, Madrid's vanity signing. They still had change to get Toni Kroos, possibly the bargain of the decade, at £20m.",
      "Ed Woodward had also incepted the United tax by signing Marouane Fellaini for £4.5m more than was necessary in 2013. Back when FFP was not an issue for United and profitability and sustainability rules had not entered the football lexicon, Woodward operated as though spending inflated fees was a sound strategy. Luke Shaw became football's most expensive teenager two months before Di Maria was driven through the barriers at Carrington.",
      "Erik ten Hag aimed high in the Premier League market and the price was not right for United. They were not in the running when Declan Rice was available in 2023, having already earmarked Mason Mount as their central midfield target, and refused to test the waters with Tottenham for Harry Kane.",
      "Those two England internationals cost £187m combined when they moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munich. The negotiations of those deals involved 'big six' clubs, whereas Cunha and Mbeumo are more affordable, having operated outside of the elite, and are not England internationals.",
      "Brentford were looking for between £50m and £60m for Ivan Toney last year until it transpired that no Premier League clubs would meet them at the table. That drove his price down to £40m for Al Ahli. Mbeumo, in contrast, generated interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United and outperformed any of Toney's top-flight campaigns before he decided on United. So he was never going to be as cheap.",
      "£60m is a figure that came to define United's 2023 summer window, one of their worst. Everyone at the club maintained that was the maximum they would pay for Rasmus Hojlund. Eventually, they overpaid with a final package of £72m.",
      "On the eve of the 2024 window, Berrada warned United would be on a \"slippery slope\" if they overpaid clubs, players and agents. Their spending was more disciplined, even if it eventually totalled £206m, but this year it is needs must after United's worst season in 51 years. A little more than £120m for two of the best forwards in the Premier League last season is a statement.",
      "United have made savings through their existence outside of the Champions League. For the third season out of four, players will be on a reduced salary due to their failure to qualify for the competition again.",
      "Two rounds of redundancies and slashing the non-playing workforce by roughly a third have also freed up funds after a decrease of £20m year-on-year on employee benefit expenses. United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's remark that United could have gone \"bust\" by Christmas always sounded like scaremongering. PSR has genuinely compromised them (they loaned in Wout Weghorst as Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season replacement when Cody Gakpo was available), only it was undermined by squandering £625.43m under Ten Hag.",
      "United's market movement under Berrada has been hitherto inoffensive but the greater the price, the greater the scrutiny. And United are now going north of £60m."

      "Onana is under contract at United until 2028 and the club would require a fee of £28.32million to sell him without making a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",

      "One of the biggest criticisms Manchester United have faced in recent years has been their failure to offload players at the right time.",
      "United have been guilty of allowing too many players to run down their contracts in, resulting in them leaving for free.",
      "A prime example was when Jesse Lingard was allowed to walk away from Old Trafford for nothing in June 2022. He excelled on loan at West Ham United in the second half of the 2020/21 campaign, scoring nine goals and registering five assists.",
      "It meant he created a market for himself with just a year remaining on his contract and United had a golden opportunity to sell him.",
      "Instead, he was sold the idea by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that he would have a key role in 2021/22. In reality, he played just 22 times and made a paltry three Premier League starts before leaving for nothing.",
      "Now United must learn their lesson. Having failed to qualify for next season's Champions League, their fixture list could amount to as few as 40 matches. It means head coach Ruben Amorim will not require as big a squad as he did last term.",
      "As hungry as Amorim and the supporters are for new signings to come through the door, outgoings remain just as important at Old Trafford. It is no secret United need to sell to be able to buy this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already cost £62.5million and United have recently tabled an offer in excess of £60m for Bryan Mbeumo. New recruits are likely to cease after that until a flurry of sales are overseen.",
      "United are prioritising the departures of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony and they also want to sell Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Of that quartet, Sancho's United contract is the closest to expiring. His current deal is up in 2026, meaning time is running out for United to bank a respectable fee for him.",
      "United planned to sell him to Chelsea for a fee in excess of £20m after they signed him on a season-long loan deal last summer with an obligation to make it permanent. However, the Londoners have paid a £5m penalty fee to pull out.",
      "United now need to find an alternative route to sell Sancho this summer, and that is so far proving difficult because of his wage demands. One way or another, however, they need to get him off the books or risk of losing him for nothing.",
      "Casemiro's current deal is also up at the end of next season. Amid their search for a midfielder this summer and a lack of European football next term, the Brazilian is unlikely to play a prominent role.",
      "He was on the outskirts of Amorim's squad at the beginning of this calendar year and only United's run to the Europa League final allowed him to salvage something from what had otherwise been a difficult campaign.",
      "He will turn 34 in February and United need to lower the average of their squad. He was always going to be a short-term option after arriving from Real Madrid in August 2022.",
      "United need to sell him for £15m this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability (PSR) rules. It remains to be seen if anyone will come in for the Brazilian.",
      "But with his and Sancho's current deals up in a year's time, anything would be better than nothing amid the threat of them both leaving next summer for free."

      "Chelsea would rather sign Jamie Gittens, a younger winger who left Manchester City's academy for Borussia Dortmund three years after Sancho. That's how little Chelsea think of Sancho and how far his stock has sunk since he joined United four years ago. And he still will not accept a pay cut.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not met Sancho and he does not need to. Sancho eschewed pre-season training in his first summer at United in 2021 when he was expected up at St Andrew's, so he can stay away from his current teammates.",
      "Amorim could do without the sight of the content-creating \"brothers\" who undermined United on Sunday, too. Rashford and Garnacho are burning their bridges with United, burnt from remunerating Rashford with a five-year contract two years ago.",
      "Rashford is now fluttering his eyelashes at Barcelona. This is a forward on £325,000 a week who has scraped 13 Premier League goals in two seasons and hardly set the world alight in the claret and blue of Aston Villa.",
      "It is a bit like that interaction between Danny Rose and Daniel Levy in the Tottenham Hotspur All or Nothing documentary. Rose was available for a loan move and there was interest from Newcastle United and Bournemouth. Rose wanted something more glamorous.",
      "\"Did you follow up on Milan?\" he asks. Levy just about suppresses a cackle. \"Milan's a no at the moment.\" Barcelona could be a no for Rashford.",
      "It is fanciful for United to be rid of Rashford, Sancho and Garnacho by the time of take-off at Manchester Airport on July 22. None should be on the plane, though.",
      "There is no resale value to protect with Sancho and Rashford was exiled six months ago. Garnacho, 21 next week, is different but his relationship with Amorim is strained and the manager visibly chuckled at the remote possibility of Garnacho somehow staying at United next season.",
      "Amorim is not the kind of personality to countenance such an arrangement. It was different with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, saddled with the wantaway Romelu Lukaku in 2019 as United toured Australia, Singapore and China.",
      "Solskjaer repeatedly claimed Lukaku was injured. We had to take him at face value but did not really believe him. Lukaku treated his final trip with United so frivolously he recorded Luke Shaw lagging behind one of the fitness coaches during a jog around the WACA in Perth.",
      "After United returned to Manchester, there were two more friendlies in Norway and Cardiff that Lukaku was absent for. Then he went AWOL.",
      "He finally joined Inter Milan - United's opponents in Singapore - at the end of the Premier League transfer window, back when it closed before the start of the new season.",
      "Lukaku had become such an upstart he leaked data from United's running drills onto Twitter. United, adamant they would not sell for less than the £75m they paid for Lukaku two years earlier, compromised and cut their losses.",
      "Matheus Cunha will be on the plane to the Windy City and United hope Bryan Mbeumo will be. They may have to wait a little longer for that elusive striker, which raises the question as to who would lead the line in a pre-season summer devoid of an international tournament.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has won over many but Amorim does not consider him a specialist striker. High-ranking figures at United speak dismissively of Rasmus Hojlund, generating interest from Inter Milan. Chido Obi is primed to remain in the first team squad but is far too raw.",
      "In my interview with Matthijs de Ligt last month, he expressed approval of Amorim's methods. \"I think what I'm experiencing now is what I like to see and that is what the manager is doing right now. I'm not speaking into details, but I have a feeling he's really looking at the spots.",
      "\"I'm not only speaking about players only, but also about the whole culture and the way we are working at the club. I think he's really into details.\"",
      "We had the ill-fated 'cultural reset' in that summer of 2019. David de Gea told me that \"the culture had to change\". A check of the calendar confirms that De Gea said that in 2022.",

      "Mbeumo was one of the best players in the Premier League last season, highlighted by his tally of 20 Premier League goals. He also registered seven assists.",
      "United are desperate to strengthen their attacking options this summer after finishing the 2024/25 campaign with a negative goal difference of -10. They have already made progress on that score, signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m earlier this month.",
      "Just as they so often did during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday, United are now prioritising trying to recruit Premier League proven players, who they hope will be able to come in and hit the ground running.",

      "Having often turned to the overseas market for new additions in recent years, United's decision to try and recruit players from closer to home is a wise move - and has already had the seal of approval from former Reds captain Gary Neville.",
      "\"Man United has become a very difficult place for new signings to operate over the past 10 years,\" Neville said earlier this month.",
      "\"Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type. When I watch wide players these days, they have to be able to get box to box quickly, they have to be able to run and travel with the ball - they can both do that.\"",
      "With confirmation of United making an improved bid for Mbeumo, it is crystal clear they are prioritising players with Premier League pedigree. As a result, it should allow new additions to adapt to their new surroundings fairly seamlessly.",
      "United have taken too many gambles when it has to come signing attacking players in recent years such as Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Antony.",
      "Although Cunha and potentially Mbeumo offer no guarantee of replicating the form they produced at Wolves and Brentford, respectively, United's decision to target the pair of them does make sense."

      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest surrounding Garnacho.",

      "Both players are expted to leave Old Trafford this summer, with Marcus Rashford also not in Amorim's plans. The Argentinian's post on social media caused quite a stir with the United faithful.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli approached the Reds to sign Garnacho back in January but their £40m offer was not enough to tempt United into a sale. With Napoli back in the Champions League next season and Antonio Conte clearly a fan of the youngster, another approach is not out of the question.",
      "Meanwhile, The Independent have also claimed that Villa are monitoring the winger's situation at M16 but his steep asking price could prove to be a stumbling block. Should Morgan Rogers depart amid interest from Arsenal and Chelsea, then Villa could possibly make a move.",

      "\"If we go back to even Foden, when they're all fit it's the end product, the final pass or actually getting a goal. So Garnacho, huge questions, I was a big fan of him last year and thought he was going to kick on but this season, but he's not as of yet.\""

      "Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin and highly-rated Atalanta shot-stopper Marco Carnesecchi have also been mentioned as possible candidates to replace Onana. One name that has been supposedly on United's radar for a number of years is Porto's Diogo Costa.",
      "The 25-year-old has been a busy man this summer with him playing a key role in Portugal's Nations League win at the start of the month before featuring twice in Porto's Club World Cup campaign. However, the Dragons crashed out of the competition on Tuesday morning after failing to beat Egyptian side Al Ahly.",
      "Porto's exit has been compounded with reports in Portugal in the aftermath suggesting that Costa 'believes it is time to embrace a new challenge' after achieving all he can with the club. A Bola have claimed the goalkeeper wants to move to a bigger league with United and Manchester City two teams described as being 'very interested'.",
      "Pep Guardiola has already confirmed that Ederson and Stefan Ortega will remain at the club meaning City aren't likely to pursue a move, leaving the door open for United. However, the Portugal number one won't come cheap.",

      "That figure could decrease as the window goes on, especially if Costa begins to push for a move. For United, Costa's numbers are appealing. Last season, he conceded 27 goals compared to Onana's 44 and boasted a better save percentage (74.1%) in comparison to Onana's 68.9%, despite facing 47 less shots on target.",
      "On the ball, Costa also outshines the current number one. The Porto goalkeeper completed 83.1% of his 1222 passes last term compared to Onana's 72.6%. While the pair are very similar in their numbers for short and medium passes (99.5% in both for Costa and 99.1% for Onana), the Portuguese completed 55.7% of his long passes with Onana managing just 36.6%.",
      "All the numbers point towards United drastically improving in the goalkeeper department with Costa inbetween the sticks. But they would have to sell Onana and seek as close to the £47.2m they paid for him."

      "Jesse Lingard has fired Paul Pogba a message ahead of a proposed return to professional football. The former Manchester United midfielder was provisionally suspended in September 2023 after a random drug test found increased levels of testosterone in his system.",
      "Pogba was then given a four-year ban in February 2024. The France international appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and his sanction was reduced to 18 months, making him eligible to return to first-team training in January.",
      "Before the 32-year-old could lace up his boots and play competitively again, Juventus terminated his contract, which wasn't set to expire until June 2026. Pogba has been a free agent ever since then, but he appears to have finally found himself a new club.",
      "According to ESPN and Le Parisien, the Frenchman will join AS Monaco this summer. The report adds that Pogba has verbally agreed to sign a two-year contract with the Ligue 1 outfit after turning down a lucrative offer from an unnamed team in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Pogba teased his return to action on social media earlier this week. On Monday, he uploaded a handful of pictures from a private training session with Amir Richardson, a midfielder for Fiorentina, and Tyreek Hill, a wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, among others, too.",
      "\"I think it's time,\" wrote Pogba under the post, which has since eclipsed 1.3million likes. Among the thousands of comments from supporters, Jesse Lingard fuelled speculation of a move to Monaco and said: \"Hurry up, we ready my bro.\"",
      "While Pogba has been linked with a return to football, he's remained coy on the matter, at least publicly. Speaking on Sergio Aguero's podcast, La Casa del Kun, the former United star provided an update on his future.",

I loved the people who went to see Boca's match [at the Club World Cup], it's crazy because I went to Marseille, which is hot, Naples is hot, but Boca... I've never seen that in my life.\"",
      "Then, in an interview with French television channel TF1, Pogba opened up about how he was treated by Juventus before being released. He said: \"I asked Juventus for help, but I wasn't given it.",
      "\"I asked to get a fitness coach. I had the right, and I was always part of the team. They weren't very kind to me, and they did not support me, and I was shocked. I did not understand why.",
      "\"I thought I was at war with anti-doping authorities, not Juventus. I couldn't keep taking my kids to school every day, passing by the stadium and the training centre, and knowing I wouldn't be able to play for a long time.",
      "\"My kids kept asking me when I'd be back on the pitch and when they could watch me at the stadium again.\"",

      "Keane believes Garnacho cannot be trusted to start for United, suggesting he performs better as a substitute off the bench.",
      "Speaking to ITV during United's FA Cup tie against Leicester City in February, he said: \"I think it suits Garnacho when he comes off the bench. I don’t think you can trust him when he starts. But when he comes off the bench and you’re gambling and the team is stretched, that’s when he comes into his own.",
      "\"United put Leicester on the backfoot and the subs came on. That’s what Garnacho does well. The first half United were going sideways and sideways. He came on and tested Leicester.\"",
      "Before United’s Manchester derby against Manchester City, Keane shared his thoughts on what the Argentine winger needed to improve in his game.",
      "\"That's an area of his game that, if he wants to stay at this Man United team and get Man United competing towards the top, end product is key. If we go back to even Foden, when they're all fit it's the end product, the final pass or actually getting a goal.",
      "\"So Garnacho, huge questions, I was a big fan of him last year and thought he was going to kick on but this season, but he's not as of yet.\"",
      "After scoring in United’s 3-0 win over Leicester City last November, Keane criticized the Argentine’s muted celebration. The former midfielder argued that players should show respect to fans who travel to watch them play, adding that he should leave the club if he can’t even celebrate with them.",
      "\"If you can’t celebrate a goal, there is something drastically wrong with this game,\" the former Reds captain Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Whatever has gone on off the pitch for any player - it could be family stuff - you work all week, you’re playing the game to score a goal.",
      "\"When you score a goal, there should be nothing else on your mind. You’ve got fans who have travelled, paid fortunes to get there, and he’s [Garnacho] on about people having a go at him. People make sacrifices to travel to watch Manchester United, he scores a brilliant goal, they are having a tough time - and if a younger player can’t enjoy scoring a goal for Man United, then get a job somewhere else.\"",
      "Keane singled out Garnacho for criticism following the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea last month. \"Garnacho is immature,\" he stated.",
      "\"He plays in little moments, but he doesn't do enough. We spoke before the programme - you want players for the big clubs that turn up week in, week out. He doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent; he makes some good runs and threatens in behind. On his good day, you think, 'I like what I see.' But he's got too many bad days.\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres' future remains unresolved, with Manchester United still linked to the prolific goalscorer.",
      "The Sweden international remains linked with a move away from Sporting Clube de Portugal, with Arsenal and Juventus among the clubs vying for his signature. Unlike United, Arsenal can offer Champions League football - something that appeals to the 27-year-old.",
      "Despite talks of a reunion with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, Gyokeres seems inclined to join Arsenal - but whether the move will materialise remains to be seen",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest surrounding Gyokeres.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper Record, the club’s decision left Gyokeres 'angered'. In response, the striker removed all references to Sporting and Sweden from his Instagram bio, which now simply reads 'Sportsperson'.",
      "Addressing the situation, Sporting president Frederico Varandas said: \"One thing is that you should already know me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me. I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60+€10m (in add-ons) because I never promised him that.\"",
      "When asked if there were any offers for €60m, Varandas added: \"To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyokeres, neither today nor last season. He is a fantastic professional, to this day he has had zero offers. He has a three-year contract with Sporting.\"",
      "Portuguese newspaper A Bola now claims that Gyokeres is growing frustrated with the lack of progress on his transfer.",
      "Both United and Arsenal have long been known to admire the prolific striker, while Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other potential suitors.",
      "talkSPORT reporter Alex Crook revealed he received a message claiming the Swede has told family and friends he expects to join Arsenal.",
      "\"I had a message 24 hours or so ago suggesting that Viktor Gyokeres has told friends and family he expects to join Arsenal,\" he is quoted as saying.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha, Mikel Arteta wants Gyokeres in place for Arsenal’s pre-season tour of Asia at the end of next mont",
      "Meanwhile, different Portuguese newspaper Record claimed last week that Gyokeres is set to 'wait until the end to see his dream of playing for Arsenal become reality.'",
      "The Sweden international is still on holiday but believes patience will be crucial to securing a move to north London this summer."

      "Sancho, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, where he clinched the UEFA Conference League, is expected to be sold this summer. His last appearance for the Red Devils was in the Community Shield last year, marking a disappointing stint for both player and club.",
      "One possibility being mooted is a move to Juventus in exchange for the Serbian striker. The 25-year-old, previously linked with Arsenal, has been largely confined to the bench at the Italian giants following the loan signing of Randal Kolo-Muani in January.",
      "Italian media reports suggest that Juventus are considering offering Vlahovic - who has a year left on his contract - to secure Sancho, whom they have been interested in since last year, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Despite boasting a respectable tally of 57 goals in 144 games, Vlahovic has struggled to replicate the lethal form he displayed during his time at Fiorentina, reports the Mirror.",
      "This season, he has scored 16 goals across all competitions, just one less than Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee combined. This scoring prowess will undoubtedly be attractive to the Premier League giants.",
      "Regarding his uncertain future, the Serbian striker reportedly turned down an eye-watering £17million-a-year deal back in January, according to Corriere dello Sport. Despite not yet reaching his peak, Vlahovic's decision to stay in a top European league rather than accepting a lucrative offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr could be seen as a positive sign by United bosses.",
      "It shows that he has ambitions to compete for trophies on the top stage rather than take a big payday.",
      "Vlahovic's commitment to his club and team-mates, meanwhile, was evident last season during a challenging period for Juventus. After a fourth consecutive Serie A draw, which ended 2-2 against Venezia, the Juve players walked over to their fans to thank them for their support, as is tradition.",
      "However, the fans responded with insults and disrespectful chants. Vlahovic didn't take kindly to this and shouted back at the fans. Despite the players walking away, the fans continued with their insults, prompting the striker to give them a sarcastic thumbs-up, as reported by Sky Sport Italia.",
      "While it's not ideal for a player to have a row with their own supporters, it does demonstrate to United that Vlahovic isn't shy about expressing his views and will back his team-mates when he deems it necessary.",
      "Introducing such a robust character into the dressing room could yield both positive and negative outcomes, and Ruben Amorim will undoubtedly be weighing up a variety of factors as he continues his quest for additional reinforcements this summer, including a new striker.",
      "The Portuguese boss has so far welcomed one new signing this summer in Matheus Cunha, who they purchased for £62.5m from Wolves. While interest persists in Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres, United are facing competition for the attackers from Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively."

      "Football kits are no longer just football kits. There are now so many of them, with pretty much every team releasing at least three brand new ones – plus goalkeeper efforts – every single season.",
      "The actual inspiration for these kits is as it always was, of course: to separate fans from their hard-earned. But it’s absolutely vital that nobody directly involved ever say that quiet part out loud.",
      "And with prices ever increasing – 85 quid for a ‘replica’ now appears to be the industry standard for a short-sleeve adult shirt – alongside the physical number of new shirts, more and more convoluted justification is now required.",
      "Every kit is now inspired by something that definitely isn’t billionaires getting their hands on your 85 pounds, no. As football clubs grow ever less tethered to their immediate surroundings, so kits become more and more ‘inspired’ by their ‘iconic’ stadium or city or shopping centre.",
      "It’s all complete guff and like so much about football we hate-love it enormously. It’s yet another thing that was on our list of things that we definitely don’t care about, thanks, that we’ve now written yet another 1000 words about. No, you shut up.",
      "Here are the top five best/worst examples so far this year, bearing in mind there are loads more of these things to come yet with new-kit season really only a few weeks old at this point.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea home",
      "Celebrate the storied history of the club and the ever-evolving, vibrant spirit of London with Chelsea FC’s 2025-26 Home kit. This replica jersey features classic Chelsea blue and a subtle print inspired by the city’s architecture. Inspired by London’s iconic landmarks and creative culture. The very fabric of London is in the Chelsea blue fabric.",
      "Inspired by London and its culture and its vibrant spirit and its architecture and its iconic London iconic landmarks and iconic architecture that is so very iconic. Made in Georgia.",
      "Also scores more general points for obeying one of the ancient laws of the press release, which is to include a capital letter on a random word where it has no business being. Step forward, ‘Home’. The clumsy, unrhythmic repetition of ‘fabric’ in that pay-off line another absolute treat.",
      "The Fabric of London, woven into every thread.",
      "Introducing Chelsea’s 25/26 Home Kit.",

      "4) Manchester United home",
      "The stadium in every stitch. The new Home kit features an abstract sleeve graphic inspired by the Theatre of Dreams. Few sporting stages can match the drama Manchester United’s iconic home ground has generated over the years. So this adidas jersey pays tribute to the stadium in which it will be starring in 25/26 with a “Theatre of Dreams” sign-off and abstract Old Trafford-inspired graphics on the sleeves.",
      "Football kit PR writers avoid using the word ‘iconic’ challenge: impossible. It cannot be done. There will never again exist a football kit that is just a football kit without ‘drawing inspiration from’ some ‘iconic’ time or place or thing.",
      "Another word these guys bloody love is ‘abstract’ which usually means you can only get even the slightest hint of this iconic inspiration if you squint, and look at a funny angle and ideally consume some kind of hallucinogen.",
      "We’re also just fundamentally not sure on any level that in big 2025 any new Man United thing should be tying itself too directly to Old Trafford, a ground now infamously and visibly past its prime with a leaky roof and fading paintwork. It doesn’t scream pristine long-lasting garment worth 85 of your hard-earned pounds.",

      "In 1974, Chelsea FC debuted a uniform honouring one of the greatest and most influential national teams ever assembled, the Magnificent Magyars. Chelsea continues that celebration of excellence with a sophisticated kit design using the colours of the Hungarian flag.",
      "Also crowingly self-dubbed a ‘London masterpiece’ – which is surely not for Chelsea themselves to say – this kit ‘continues’ a celebration of excellence by making the first reference to it in over 50 years for no real apparent reason beyond someone somewhere flicking through old Chelsea kits to find one to be inspired by/rip off that hadn’t already been done yet. Magnificent guff.",

      "",
      "2) Aston Villa away",
      "On away days, this Aston Villa FC jersey reminds players and fans of their home city. The print on its raglan sleeves was inspired by the striking facade of a world-famous Birmingham landmark.",
      "The best bit here is deeming said landmark to be so world-famous it doesn’t even need to be named, which we’re going to go right ahead and assume is some kind of convoluted legal issue involving copyright or naming rights or somesuch that probably involved multiple back-and-forths, 27 Teams meetings, 164 emails and 73 rewrites before they settled on just how clearly they could hint at it.",
      "You know they’re treading carefully when the source of a kit’s inspiration isn’t even described as iconic. But obviously it’s the Bullring. Even if you haven’t seen the kit you already know it’s the Bullring. If it’s Birmingham it’s always the Bullring. Specifically that shiny wavy bit with all silver circles on it with a Selfridges in.",
      "And in fairness, unlike most of these inspirations, you can actually see what they mean on the kit. No ‘abstract’ cheats or ‘subtle nods’ here, except in the press release itself.",

      "1) Tottenham away",
      "Tottenham Hotspur’s 2025-26 away shirt welcomes you to match day in the year 2082. This London-inspired battle armour uses tonal blacks and cutting-edge trims to create an innovative, stealthy look that the enemy won’t see coming.",
      "The trophies just keep coming for Spurs. First the Europa League, then the Harshest But Probably Correct In The Cold Light Of Day Sacking trophy, and now the Most Egregious Kit Launch Bullshit award. The trophy cabinet is positively bulging these days.",
      "Just as well, too. We don’t know but we assume the layers of approval this kind of assault on the English language has to negotiate mean initial sign-off on that astonishing pair of sentences probably happened months ago, meaning Spurs are unbelievably lucky not to have left themselves as wide open as their defence to the easiest of ‘and the trophy drought goes on’ banters with that batsh*t bit about 2082.",
      "We very much enjoy the fact that even though it has now been 30 years since black ceased to be the preserve of referees, and that Spurs themselves had a black away kit over 10 years ago now, and that somewhere close to half the Premier League appears to have a black away or third kit this season that Tottenham and/or Nike adorably appear to be believe it is nevertheless some wildly unimaginable futuristic flourish that will baffle and astonish.",
      "Of course it’s ‘London-inspired’ because every kit this season apparently comes with such geographical influence as standard for your 85 pounds, but we are entirely unsure what precisely about this football kit qualifies it as so inspired, or indeed as ‘battle armour’. It appears to possess as few protective qualities as any other recycled polyester weave.",
      "And this apparent ‘stealth’ mode sounds ominously like it could be a bit self-defeating in a Man United grey kit fashion.",
      "We like the idea of ‘tonal blacks’, but this does feel like a missed opportunity to go full Spinal Tap. It’s a pastel black. And how much more black and London-inspired could it be? And the answer is none. None… more black and London-inspired.",

      "How will Tottenham react to Manchester United’s second bid for Bryan Mbeumo? In the meantime, they’ve been linked with Villa and Chelsea forwards…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "",
      "19) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nOk, so the source is a little ropey, but this could make sense later in the window in the form of an exchange if Villa are still interested in Marcus Rashford. United need a centre-forward and want rid of Rashford, who often started ahead of Watkins for Villa in the second half of last season. Speculative for the moment, but it could become an option later in the summer.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nIt seems Martinez wants it known that he fancies a move to Old Trafford, especially now Barcelona have got themselves fixed up with another goalkeeper. Our reading: United’s feeling is mutual, but they have to shift Onana. No easy task…",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho/Christopher Nkunku – Man Utd and Chelsea swap\nThis would solve some problems for both clubs, but maybe not enough for United. Getting rid of Garnacho would be the big win, but Nkunku is not the type of forward they really need. If they sign Bryan Mbeumo to play as a no.10 alongside Matheus Cunha, then they are sorted for forwards off the front man – it’s the central striker they badly need. And if Chelsea get Gittens, with Geovany Quenda arriving in a year, do they really need Garnacho? They definitely don’t need his bullsh*t.",
      "",
      "16) Gabriel Martinelli – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nBayern are said to be eyeing Martinelli after missing out on Florian Wirtz and the winger will certainly see his game time at Arsenal limited if Mikel Arteta lands a new winger, as is his intention. Reports suggest Arsenal want £50million for Martinelli, which Bayern could afford, but this doesn’t seem to have moved beyond the exploratory stage.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWith Thomas Partey on his way, following Jorginho through the free-agents’ exit, Arsenal need reinforcements in midfield. Norgaard has reportedly been identified as a value option, though Brentford aren’t likely to simply roll over and have their bellies tickled over a player who signed a new two-year contract in March.",

      "",
      "12) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle are back in for Elanga, with £38million Harvey Barnes said to be a makeweight in any Toon offer. Which values Elanga at perhaps £50million. Which seems… excessive? Still, like James Trafford, below, Newcastle’s fondness for Elanga goes back a long way.",
      "",
      "11) Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. But they are making slow progress, if any. Palace offered £35million; Sporting want closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Talks are talking place, Trafford wants the move… expect this to happen once the new PSR year starts next week, probably for around £30million. Prompting some good old-fashion keeper dominoes.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nApparently, Arsenal are hot again for Gyokeres having failed to agree a deal for Benjamin Sesko. So they’re back trying to negotiate with Sporting, who blew them out last time. Assuming they are serious and don’t switch targets for the 427th time, Arsenal want Gyokeres through the door before their pre-season tour to Asia. We just want Arsenal to pick a lane for this to be over.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We wait to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIn Merseyside for a medical. Assuming the left-back gets the all-clear from Liverpool’s doc, he’ll be unveiled shortly.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million."

      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top 10.",
      "These are the greatest decreases in market value since January 1 of players contracted to Premier League clubs, with figures taken from Transfermarkt.",
      "",
      "10) Joel Ndala (Manchester City)\nIt could still be that Ndala is soon entered into the Manchester City cheat code as the 19-year-old is yet to make his debut for the club he joined aged 10.",
      "But if this past season was designed to mark his professional breakthrough after forming part of the travelling Etihad squad for the 2023 Club World Cup and winning the 2024 FA Youth Cup final, the plan went awry somewhere along the line.",
      "A loan to PSV with an £8.4m option to buy went so well that Manchester City cancelled it in February to send Ndala to Nottingham Forest with the same clause, only this time worth £4m.",
      "That rather neatly captures the fall in value suffered by the forward, who will be stuck this summer until Manchester City get around to sorting new temporary homes for those players who have fallen through the cracks between the Academy and the first team.",
      "",
      "9) Deivid Washington (Chelsea)\n“Leaving was God’s plan. I wanted to stay at Santos, but I spoke to my parents and had the chance to go to Chelsea. We chose together. God spoke to me and we went to Chelsea,” said Washington in a risible endorsement of the divine one’s work as an agent earlier this year.",
      "The Brazilian forward is right to put his own personal slant and transparently brave face on things but if “God’s plan” as a footballer ever involves being signed for £14m, making three substitute appearances of a combined 25 minutes and being sent back to your former club within 18 months with five years remaining on your contract with the team which has clearly forgotten about your existence and bought a handful more younger players in your position, then God has messed up.",
      "“It was not a mistake,” Washington continued to insist as he slowly shrank and transformed into a corn cob, having scored one goal in 14 games back at Santos. “I left when I had to leave and came back when I had to come back,” he added, summing up the life of a Chelsea player destined to be loaned out about seven more times before his deal expires.",
      "",
      "8) Adrian Mazilu (Brighton)\nBrighton are far from above speculating to accumulate. The key difference which separates them from most in the transfer market is how phenomenal they are at it.",
      "But there are no cast-iron guarantees in player identification and recruitment; Brighton’s impressive hit-rate only means the chances of them developing the next Moises Caicedo or Alexis Mac Allister rather than Valentin Barco or Abdallah Sima’s successor is akin to a coin flip.",
      "Mazilu has fallen by that wayside hard. An exciting January 2024 signing made in advance, the Romanian forward was sent on an immediate loan to Vitesse as Brighton turned the tables and copied Chelsea’s homework.",
      "With opportunities difficult to come by in the Eredivisie, it was instead decided that Mazilu would spend this past season under the watchful eye of the Seagulls, who perhaps did not expect for him to suffer a foreboding hamstring injury and myriad recovery setbacks which have sidelined him until this summer.",
      "When Mazilu is introduced back into the fold, it won’t be as part of the first team. But it will be with three years left on his contract.",
      "",
      "7) Kendry Paez (Chelsea)\nNothing sums BlueCo Chelsea up quite like two of Mauricio Pochettino’s first ‘signings’ as manager: a player bought during the reign of his predecessor; and a player whose pre-arranged purchase means he will make his debut for the club under the Argentinean’s successor.",
      "Paez might consider his £17.27m move from Independiente del Valle to be a triumph if he makes it as far as actually playing for Enzo Maresca, who confirmed that the teenager had belatedly joined them on Club World Cup duty in the United States this summer after some confusion.",
      "But with that came a familiar harbinger of bomb squad ruin. “We’ll see what the plan is in the next few weeks,” said the head coach, who will presumably spend that time perfecting his phrasing of ‘You ever heard of Strasbourg, fella?’.",
      "",
      "6) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nEven with some eye-catching performances on loan, that filthy Leicester brush was bound to tar Buonanotte.",
      "Brighton had stockpiled more than enough talent to afford to send some down the Premier League food chain last season. Ipswich borrowed Julio Enciso, West Ham were loaned Evan Ferguson, Buonanotte was posted to Leicester and Southampton were left wondering what they’d done wrong.",
      "Buonanotte impressed in bursts as one of the bigger fish in a small and cursed pond, but also incited the fury of Ruud van Nistelrooy after one particularly wasteful substitute appearance and only featured infrequently thereafter.",
      "",
      "5) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nIt feels like Manchester United would take that £40m if offered again. It doesn’t bear thinking about how many people Sir Jim Ratcliffe would be willing to make redundant for Napoli to pick up the phone and start things where they left off in January.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Ruben Amorim told Garnacho in front of his Manchester United teammates at the end of the season, yet a willing buyer was right there in the winter to answer that invocation.",
      "The way Garnacho and his team have systematically decimated his value in a matter of months is almost impressive. A 20-year-old Argentina international forward who trailed just Bruno Fernandes, Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot for outfield minutes at Manchester United last season – and only Fernandes for goals – sounds entirely worthy of that £60m valuation.",
      "But it is preposterous considering his ostracisation under this manager is painfully public knowledge, Garnacho’s reaction to which has involved taking some increasingly childish measures specifically designed to court controversy.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nThere will be no rival shirts worn with the name of a similarly exiled teammate pointedly emblazoned on the back, no habitual middle finger deployment at the sign of a camera, no agent-based buffoonery.",
      "But the fall of Mainoo from teenage midfield sensation to an injury-prone potential sale with no fixed position needs to be studied and proves how deep the toxicity at Old Trafford runs.",
      "Amorim is yet to establish where he feels Mainoo best fits into his system. The England international has been trialled in more defensive roles and as a centre-forward but it is yet to click for player or manager.",
      "The idea Manchester United could still generate £150m from offloading both Mainoo and Garnacho feels absurd but a decision must be made as to whether they rehabilitate the former themselves or let someone else pay a knockdown fee for the honour.",
      "",
      "3) Ibrahim Osman (Brighton)\n“When you perform at Brighton, you get to play. That’s why I chose Brighton,” said Osman recently, having had neither the chance to perform nor play on the coast.",
      "Brighton announced Osman’s signing from Nordsjaelland in February 2024 and sent him on loan to Feyenoord by that August in the hope it would provide some extra seasoning, including Champions League experience.",
      "The Ghanaian forward received precisely that, even starting and impressing against runners-up Inter in the knockouts.",
      "The expectation from Brighton might have been for Osman to start more than six Eredivisie games before returning but three goals and assists apiece for the country’s third-best team suggested there is a player for Fabian Hurzeler to work with if he so wishes.",
      "",
      "2) Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nAs a £25.5m signing from Palmeiras, Luis Guilherme might have foreseen an easier path to the West Ham first team.",
      "A Brazilian teenager living and playing outside of his home country for the first time, the winger would have accepted a period of acclimatisation was necessary.",
      "But his 13 appearances for the Hammers last season were spread out across 139 underwhelming minutes under two different managers, neither of whom seemed to know what to do with former Liverpool target Guilherme. It doesn’t feel like Graham Potter will have learned over the course of the summer.",
      "",
      "1) Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nThe West Ham curse is real, although again it is ultimately Brighton whose model has harmed some players as much as it has helped others.",
      "An ankle ligament injury requiring surgery did the most damage to Ferguson’s stratospheric ascent through the ranks and onto that most inevitable of places for a thriving teenage goalscorer: the transfer shortlists of Chelsea and Manchester United.",
      "But managerial changes and the club’s general shift away from a style of play which more suited Ferguson has seen him crash to maybe fifth in the centre-forward pecking order.",
      "Brighton felt they had a £100m asset and for a time they probably did, but one goal in his last 44 games across all competitions has seen Ferguson’s stock fall as hard as it rose.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest antics have seen him labelled a ‘little dope’ in need of a ‘clip around the ear’ by one prominent football pundit.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Brentford forward Mbeumo has reportedly expressed his preference to join Ruben Amorim’s side and is unmoved by them being utter sh*te.",
      "He will not be the first to do so, nor the most expensive at around £60m. But he will find himself among these, the biggest ever signings involving a player joining a club lower in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante – £32m in July 2016",
      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",

      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",

      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap in the summer, and it’s already been noted by Micah Richards how he’ll link up “very well” with Cole Palmer after their first match ...",

The number in brackets next to each player is where they ranked when this list was first compiled in April 2022, which included 45 signings at the time. Any players signed since then have the number from when they were added. Enjoy the drivel.",
      "",
      "65) Alexis Sanchez (swap) (45)\nThe Red Devils signed one of the best players in the Premier League on astronomical wages and he seemed to become an incompetent footballer overnight.",
      "",
      "64) Jadon Sancho (£76.5m) (5)\nTime is up for Sancho at Man Utd. And Chelsea. They’ve paid £5million so they don’t have to sign him permanently. Back to square one, it is.",
      "",
      "63) Andy Kellett (loan) (44)\nWho? Exactly.",
      "",
      "62) Radamel Falcao (£6.8m loan fee) (42)\nAnother player who joined with a huge reputation; Falcao failed to rediscover his FC Porto and Atletico Madrid form during his spell with Man Utd and then Chelsea.",
      "",
      "61) Antony (£80m) (16)\nThe Brazilian has been a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we did say before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. They might get £30m now. Still a huge loss but damage limitation and all that.",
      "",
      "60) Angel Di Maria (£67.5m) (43)\nJoining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",
      "",
      "59) Memphis Depay (£30.6m) (39)\nWearing the No. 7 shirt has become something of a curse since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009; even for the Portuguese himself.",
      "Depay came in as a terrific youngster from the Netherlands and took on the famous number. The forward scored seven goals in 53 games and left for Lyon for a little over half of what Man Utd paid for him.",
      "",
      "61) Morgan Schneiderlin (£31.5m) (37)\nSchneiderlin was great for Southampton, so Louis van Gaal brought him to Old Trafford where the Frenchman was nowhere near good enough. He left for £20m, so it’s not all bad. Bloody Everton.",
      "",
      "60) Martin Dubravka (£2m loan fee) (41)\nWhen Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",
      "",
      "59) Jack Butland (loan) (39)\nBrought in for the rest of the season in January 2022 after Dubravka’s loan ended. Butland did not make a single appearance for the club.",
      "",
      "58) Odion Ighalo (£10.8m loan fee) (34)\n£10m is a lot of money for a loan deal, especially when the player doesn’t improve the squad.",

      "He was excellent in fits and starts but nowhere near consistent enough.",
      "",
      "51) Harry Maguire (£78.3m) (41)\nOften the scapegoat and always mocked, the former Man Utd captain has put in many good displays for the club. However, the bad outweighs the good and as a result, he has not even come close to nearly justifying his hefty price tag.",
      "",
      "50) Tom Heaton (free) (29)\nSee Lee Grant. But Heaton was a free transfer.",
      "",
      "49) Dan James (£16m) (24)\nJames was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",
      "",
      "48) Mason Mount (£55.4m) (22)\nHe cost an absolute fortune with only a year left on his Chelsea contract and even when fit, he has been very underwhelming.",

      "",
      "47) Eric Bailly (£34m) (22)\nErratic and amusing, Bailly was signed for big money and was more of a comical than he was convincing at defending. Injuries didn’t help him, to be fair.",
      "",
      "46) Romelu Lukaku (£76m) (35)\nHe scored a decent amount of goals but didn’t do enough to merit a £76m transfer fee.",
      "",
      "45) Tahith Chong (free) (17)\nHaving paid no transfer fee for the young Dutch winger, Man Utd looked like they did pretty well. He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, who he did quite well for.",
      "The Red Devils were right to sell Chong but definitely could have got more for him.",
      "",
      "44) Timothy Fosu-Mensah (£342k) (28)\nFosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",
      "",
      "43) Matteo Darmian (£16m) (27)\nThe Italian was bang average for United and was only sold for £2m.",
      "",
      "42) Marcos Rojo (£18m) (25)\nOften erratic, Rojo was box office at times but had an average spell at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "41) Wout Weghorst (£2.6m loan fee) (23)\nWeghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",
      "",
      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",
      "",
      "38) Nemanja Matic (£40m) (23)\nMan Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",
      "",
      "36) Rasmus Hojlund (£64.7m) (17)\nIt’s make or break for Hojlund next season…if he’s still at the club.",
      "",
      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",
      "",
      "29) Sofyan Amrabat (£8.5m loan fee) (24)\nIf Amrabat played like he did in his last month at Old Trafford all season, he would be a lot higher.",
      "",
      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",
      "",
      "27) Patrick Dorgu (£25m) (NE)\nThe jury is most certainly out on this one.",
      "",
      "26) Manuel Ugarte (£42.3m) (23)\nA signing that looks amazing on paper, Ugarte is not up to speed yet.",
      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",
      "",
      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "17) Ayden Heaven (£1.5m) (NE)\nHe might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) (NE)\nSurely…surely this can’t go wrong.",
      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",

      "Troy Deeney has urged Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes to “smash” Alejandro Garnacho in training after the winger stirred up controversy by wearing a rival club’s shirt while on holiday.",
      "Garnacho, currently on a break in Ibiza, posted a photo of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt belonging to Marcus Rashford, a move that has infuriated sections of the Man Utd fanbase and baffled pundits.",
      "Rashford, recently on loan at Villa, is also expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, speaking of his desire to play with Lamine Yamal at Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, presenter Shebahn Aherne questioned why Garnacho would risk such a public stunt amid uncertainty over his Utd future.",
      "“Did you see that picture of Garnacho wearing the Rashford Villa shirt on holiday? The guy is an absolute wind-up,” she said. “Why would you not try to fall into line when you’re trying to make your way back into the manager’s good books?",
      "“That’s the most immature thing I’ve seen from Garnacho. It’s so immature. I didn’t think you’d get that from Garnacho.",
      "“What are you doing? Why are you trying to wind everyone up and wind up the club that’s paying your wages?”",
      "Former Watford striker Deeney didn’t hold back in his response either.",
      "“They obviously think they’ve got a move lined up. It’s a new generation so I’ve got to be careful not to sound like the old, grumpy man,” he said.",
      "“But he needs a clip around the ear. Give him a clip around the ear. He’s bored and has got no respect.",
      "“If it was me at United, if I was Fernandes, I’d wait until he came back and smash him in training. I genuinely would.",
      "“I’m not even trying to make headlines, I’d smash him and say to him, ‘this is Man United, who do you think you are you little dope?’”",
      "Garnacho was once viewed as one of the club’s brightest young stars but endured a frustrating 2024-25 campaign. He fell down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim, and the new manager is understood to have told him he is free to leave if a suitable offer arrives.",
      "His limited minutes and unwillingness to adapt tactically, particularly in terms of defensive work rate, have reportedly contributed to Amorim’s decision. Garnacho is believed to be unhappy with his role, and the relationship between player and manager appears strained.",
      "Former Utd full-back Paul Parker recently echoed Deeney’s sentiments, suggesting the time has come for Garnacho to move on.",
      "“Garnacho has to go. There’s no way around it, because things will never work out at Manchester United. He doesn’t have the right mentality, and he doesn’t like to work hard. I don’t think that will ever change,” Parker told Tipsbladet.",
      "“It’s unbelievable because his idol, Ronaldo, was the complete opposite. He worked his ass off, so if Ronaldo really is his idol, then I think he should model himself a bit more on him and do what he does.",
      "“He needs a bit of fresh air, he needs a change of environment, and I think he could benefit from a move to another country.",
      "“Maybe going somewhere else will help him grow up and take on some responsibility. I think it’s become clear that his family isn’t good for him when it comes to football, so maybe a move with a new agent and some new advisors could help him too.”",
      "Both Napoli and Chelsea are said to be monitoring Garnacho’s situation, with Utd open to negotiating a sale if the right bid comes in. As it stands, few would be surprised if the Villa shirt incident proves to be one of his final acts as a Utd player.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea are targeting eight players for two positions, including four Premier League stars, to revamp Maresca’s attack as Mudryk faces a four-year ban.",
      "Chelsea are now reportedly ‘discussing a loan to buy’ move for the Man Utd star, with ‘more and more noise’ emerging over his transfer this week."

      "The Red Devils had to sell to buy in January and their recent on-field woes were expected to ensure this would also be the case this summer, but they have already invested £62.5m to sign Matheus Cunha, while they are looking to beat Tottenham in the race to sign Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "The England international butted heads with Amorim at the end of last year and joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m.",
      "Rashford returned to form at Villa Park, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances in all competitions.",

      "Despite this, Barcelona have recently turned their attention to Nico Williams and have an ‘agreement’ on a contract amid competition from Bayern Munich.",
      "Williams’ anticipated move to Barcelona had been expected to end Rashford’s hopes of joining Barcelona, but it has been suggested that this move was still on the cards with the La Liga champions impressed by his versatility.",
      "Rashford has not won Hansi Flick over, though. A report in Spain claims the Barcelona boss has ‘stopped’ the signing as he has ‘made the decision’ to ‘block’ his arrival.",
      "There is said to be one key reason for this stance, as he is unwilling to sanction an ‘unnecessary’ signing with Barcelona prioritising a new full-back. The report adds:",
      "‘Flick’s main argument for blocking this move is the accumulation of attacking players. If Nico Williams’ arrival is confirmed as planned, Barça would have a more than adequate lineup of names in attack: Nico, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Dani Olmo, Ferran Torres, and Lewandowski.",
      "‘In this context, adding Rashford would only increase competition in an already crowded area of ​​the pitch, which could generate internal tensions and hinder the development of key players like Lamine and Ferran. Furthermore, Rashford’s own inconsistency in recent months raises doubts about his immediate fit with Flick’s proposed style.’",

      "‘Nonetheless, Telegraph Sport understands there is no expectation or intention of Greenwood coming back in the future and that, if the clause does signify the door remains ajar for the player down the line, it is very much the slimmest of cracks. The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",

      "It’s fair to say that Liverpool fans are giddy about Florian Wirtz and their summer transfers, even if rival fans want to remind them of Chelsea.",
      "Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Apologies Richard Hughes\nI’m not sure how many contributors write in to offer an apology, but after a scorching (and hungover) Sunday morning run while catching up on podcasts, I feel I owe Liverpool’s Director of Football, Richard Hughes, a sincere one. So Richard, I apologise for doubting you. Not that you’d care one jot.",
      "It’s now clear that far from being paralysed with fear à la Roy Hodgson, that you, along with Michael Edwards and the data team have been meticulously laying the groundwork for what might turn out to be our most significant transfer window in six years, if not ever.",
      "I’m absolutely astonished we’ve landed Wirtz, the best player on the market this year. Like many fans, I’m dying to know what Arne Slot said to convince him to choose Anfield. Over pints at the pub this weekend, a few mates and I concluded it might’ve just been three simple words: “My Bobby Firmino.”",
      "On top of that, the potential replacements of Trent, Robbo, Diaz, and Alisson with Wirtz, Frimpong, Kerkez, and Mamardashvili drop the average age of our starting XI from 26.7 to 24.3. That’s no small feat, and it’s been done quickly and quietly.",
      "Now, I can’t wrap this up without a gentle jab at our rivals.",
      "I love how certain respected journalists continue to cozy up to Sir Alex Ferguson by framing the signings of Cunha and possibly Mbeumo as proof Man United still have pulling power. Hmm. Back in SAF’s day, they’d have been in for Wirtz and prising Nico Williams out of Spain. Now, they’re celebrating buying the best player from a side that finished below them, who spent 77.6% of the season walking (for comparison, VVD was 76%). Oh, and he gets a 67% pay rise for the privilege. It’s not quite taking Margot Robbie home!!",
      "As for Arsenal, their current blend of self-righteousness and transfer window anxiety is best summed up not by me, but by Paddy Power’s Instagram feed. Nothing I write here could possibly top that.",
      "And to Manchester (115) City and Chelsea, enjoy being pawns in Infantino’s U.S. experiment while Salah, Mac Allister, and Gravenberch are recovering on a beach somewhere. I’m sure playing in 35°C heat all July will have zero effect on your squad fitness come spring.",

      "Nobody wins the transfer window\nA few days ago, another reader wrote in claiming the Club World Cup was going to be the second-best club tournament in the world – after berating English fans as being biased against the tournament and lauding the teams (South American) who were taking it seriously. Ironic that he didn’t consider that those same teams might consider their equivalent of the Champions League – the Copa Libertadores – as either the best or, at worst, second-best club competition. No?",
      "Of course, being mid-season probably helps those clubs – still early enough in their season, they are fresh, while having a chance to gel as a team. Compared to those from Europe who have played non-stop for almost 11 months, and with the international break and bedding in new players, it will take a game or two to get back up to speed. Notwithstanding the heat they are dealing with.",
      "On that topic. I am reading about how baseball players are throwing up, needing to be withdrawn, and requiring misting and hydration stations to survive games. And this is in a sport that doesn’t require the same level of endurance, stamina, and cardiovascular exertion. Of course, this was all predictable. Not a great portent for next year’s World Cup. Not sure what’s worse though, all the fawning over the competition by pundits, totally ignoring all the issues or the competition itself.",
      "Lastly, no one wins a transfer window. It’s exciting when new players are brought in. I get it. But if past transfer windows are any gauge…just recently, Chelsea acquired 12 players in 2023, including Jackson, Palmer, Caicado and Lavia, with many Chelsea fans lauding ‘winning’ Caicedo and Lavia over Liverpool. But Liverpool did better during that season and the following year won the league with just one signing to Chelsea’s 10 signings.",
      "Some assumptions around Liverpool doing well are for signings that haven’t yet happened but might happen. And what if any of those new guys, particularly Wirtz gets injured? Frimpong is not a like-for-like exchange for TAA, and his defending stats are actually worse. Kerkez isn’t a Liverpool player yet, and Wirtz still has to be slotted (pun intended) into the current team without disrupting what worked well last season.",
      "The point is, there is a long way to go. City and Chelsea have a chance to get some early pre-season in for new players, as they are going to have a shorter traditional pre-season.",
      "For United fans bemoaning little transfer action so far, it isn’t just related to the quality of the management team in place (which is poor to be fair) but the fact that once you drop down a level, have no Champions League draw card and have to reduce the wage budget – as the past overpaying for mediocre players takes its toll – means waiting until the ‘big boys’ have had their pick of the crop.",
      "While things could be turned around – as other teams have shown – picking an only-one-way-to-play manager, playing a style that doesn’t suit most of the current squad and hasn’t shown itself to be that effective, was probably the worst decision the club could have made at this point. He’s not a draw card either. So while I said there’s no winning a transfer season, Utd are going to show the downside of being the ‘second best’ in this case.\nPaul McDevitt",

      "Big up yourselves and leave Liverpool flop talk\nWhilst there’s not much football to watch. although the U21’s game was a good watch (why do they keep losing the ball 30/40 yards from goal!} and the CWC is a grossly inflated pre-season friendly tournament, the mailbox and comments section are dominated by talk of transfers and next season.",
      "There are always people who treat all supporters of other teams with petty prejudices and outlandish generalisations, there also exists a large group of people who I would say is far more common and exemplifies an awful lot of fans, it’s the “it’s more important you fail, than we succeed” band.",
      "All teams will spend or have spent money in the belief that there squad will be improved, some clubs will sell their prized assets but will aim to re-invest this in other hidden gems. And yet, rather than talk up their team’s chances of a better season than last, a large number of people are fixated on the potential “flops” of their rivals.",
      "Man City have spent in excess of £400mil since the turn of the year and have signed a fabulous forward from the Bundesliga, the “midfielder of the season” from Serie A, a French “wonderkid” and some others at around the £40mil mark. Chelsea have bought a centre forward who may able to stay on the pitch for more than four minutes. Arsenal are seeking the mythical “centre forward” that has cost them the last three titles and a world class DM to allow Declan Rice to flourish. Even ManU look to have upgraded on their mis-firing forward line and are not finished yet.",
      "Despite this, quite a number seem pre-occupied with talking about how much Liverpool’s signings may “flop”. The fact that last season’s champions have (to use comments from last season) replaced a right back who can’t defend, an over the hill left back, signed a creative ball playing midfielder/forward to replace their non creative, non goalscoring, stagnant midfield and appear to be keen to add a centre forward to replace their megaflop and possibly strengthen their centre back options, would worry me immensely if I supported any other team.",
      "I know people will/can be ridiculed if they make big statements (e.g. the title is won already) but surely any “normal” supporter should be saying, “our signings have made us better, our signings will mean we will do better than last season”, otherwise, what’s the point, talk about your team, your hopes and dreams, don’t tie yourself up in knots wishing others to fail, embrace your own possibilities!",
      "Unfortunately this is not new, many (many) years ago, I asked a friend who supported a team in blue what his hopes were for the coming season, his initial response was, “I hope you don’t win anything”!\nHoward (is the quad on?) Jones",

The teams are all under strengthen in comparison to the actual eligible players.  Spain are not fielding Yamal for example. So the results of the tournament are not exactly one-to-one match ups with World Cup or Euro results.",
      "But there’s obviously something qualitative that happens to dip between the U21 and senior England teams. Not just the inevitable drop off subtracting merely talented footballers with the absolute top of approximately 24 players remaining. Have the U21 players simply got things to prove still and peak as teens? While the senior players are just maintaining earned privileged status and a lavish mortgage?",
      "The game is also trending young btw. Especially with the Mbappe example of 2018 World Cup which he’s not repeated once he got the fame and big salary. Yamal wins the Euros at 16-17 and may be on the same trajectory as Mbappe, not likely to repeat the international feats of his teen years in his 20s.",
      "Historically European players are said to peak around 26-27 blending their gifts with hard won experience. Recent international football results have been produced by fast fast running teenagers who cheekily trounce slightly older men.",

      "PSG’s Warren Zaire-Emery, Barcelona’s Marc Casado and Real Madrid’s Eduardo Camavinga represent unlikely options thought to be of interest to Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, with Agoume a more realistic option along with Lille’s teen sensation Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes has confirmed that Arsenal see Agoume – whose game has been compared to N’Golo Kante – ‘as an interesting option for its balance between physical, tactical criteria and projection’.",
      "The report claims ‘Arsenal seems to be the closest destination’ but with ‘nothing closed yet’, both Tottenham and Manchester United have entered the race.",
      "‘Tottenham see in Agoume an opportunity to add a young and versatile profile in the centre of the field’, while United ‘consider the Frenchman an alternative to rebuild an area of the team that showed many shortcomings last season’ after a less than impressive first campaign for £42m Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It’s claimed that without European football the Red Devils will ‘seduce the player with minutes and a solid project’…",
      "United are also desperate to land a new striker after a poor season for Rasmus Hojlund, who’s been heavily linked with a move to Serie A, and after top target Viktor Gyokeres confirmed he has no interest in a move to Old Trafford, a very surprising move for Everton’s Beto – who moved to Goodison Park for £21m from Udinese in 2023 – has been mooted by the president of Uniao Tires, the striker’s first club.",
      "“Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal,” Lopes told The Sun.",
      "“Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it is quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as a lone No 9 waiting for service.",
      "“Beto’s a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn’t lose duels. He is a real headache for opponents — if he gets the service. In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "“Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate — plus he is very fast. When Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.”"

      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",

      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
