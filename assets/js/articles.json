      "Oliver Glasner continues to be linked with Manchester United – and now Adam Wharton has cast fresh doubt over his manager's Crystal Palace future. Ruben Amorim remains under pressure despite a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Glasner is just one of a number of names who have been linked with replacing Amorim should he be sacked by the United hierarchy. The Austrian has already entered the last 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park and revealed last week he is yet to be offered a new deal.",
      "And Wharton admitted: \"Obviously there is always speculation with people's contracts coming up, but you've seen the impact he's had here and the way we are playing, so the longer he stays, the better I think.",
      "\"But anything could happen, so we will see.\"",
      "Speaking to the Austrian edition of Kicker recently, Glasner refused to rule out replacing Amorim at Old Trafford. He said: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is - neutrally and completely relaxed.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "But speaking after the victory over the Black Cats, Mason Mount insisted that his team-mates are backing Amorim to turn things around. He said: \"We're 100% behind the gaffer.",
      "\"We've had some results that hurt us - the team, the staff and the fans - but that was important today. It needs to be the start of building something.",
      "\"We thought after winning against Chelsea it would be the start of something and then we go to Brentford and have a disappointing result.",
      "\"It starts today and we'll be working hard over the break. We want to get back-to-back wins, then three in a row and push on for the top four.\"",
      "However, Jamie Carragher believes that it is 'inevitable' that Amorim will be sacked by United before Christmas.",
      "\"I don't like saying a manager should be sacked – it's disrespectful and it's a man's job – but I'm at that point where I do think Ruben Amorim's job is untenable,\" he said, speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It's inevitable that this is going to happen before Christmas. His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager – 50 games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Ruben Amorim could have been sacked by Manchester United had his side been beaten by Sunderland. Speaking ahead of Saturday’s game against the Black Cats, Amorim admitted the United board will sack him if he continues to lose matches.",
      "However, first-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin-Sesko secured the Red Devils a 2-0 victory that helped ease the pressure on the former Sporting CP boss. The United hierarchy have repeatedly told the 40-year-old that he is their man for the long term, but Ferdinand believes that stance would have been tested had his old side suffered defeat at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think there would have been serious conversations being had if they had not beaten Sunderland,\" he told his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"I didn't want to say it before the game but after the result the previous week, if they had lost to Sunderland I think it would’ve been a difficult conversation for Ineos to not consider relieving him of his duties.",
      "\"He's got to live another day, that's what we've been talking about, 'can you get some results? Can you find some consistency?'",
      "\"In an ideal world, performances will be key in that but I don't think we’re in a position to be worrying about performances, you need to get points on the board, get the team getting momentum and getting up the league.\"",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim said: \"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well.",
      "\"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance. Senne [Lammens] did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today.",
      "\"We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us. We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play.",
      "\"It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "Before he continued: \"I know they want to do their best – and I know they don’t want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"But, like I said during this week, to be with the manager is 'I will kill myself to go in every transition'. We need to show with actions.",
      "\"And sometimes when we look at our team I know for sure that when we see the games in the end they know that sometimes we can do better.",
      "\"So, I feel that during the week but we need to show that on the pitch, not just at home but also away.\"",

      "Sit Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos will cut 20% of its Acetyls plant in Hull, a matter of months after the Manchester United co-owner made another 250 people redundant at the club. The petrochemical company broke the news to employees at their Hull plan this week, revealing a total of 60 jobs are on the chopping block.",
      "Ineos pointed the finger at \"dirt-cheap carbon-heavy imports from China\" which are produced using coal, they claim are undercutting their services. Ineos group, which state on their website they generate annual revenues of around $55billion (£41bn approximately) have claimed these Chinese products have been barred from entering the United States, but face no such trade barriers in the UK or Europe.",
      "A statement from the company said they have previously invested £30m at the Hull plant so it could \"switch from natural gas to hydrogen,\" which they claim cut the equivalent emissions of \"160,000 cars.\" David Brooks, CEO of Ineos Acetyls, was the one who broke the news to his team of approximately 300 people.",
      "Brooks said: \"This is a very difficult time for everyone at the Hull facility. We have a leading-edge, efficient and well-invested site and the team here is highly skilled, professional and dedicated.",
      "\"Making the decision to cut 60 roles was not taken lightly. We have explored every possible alternative but in the face of sustained pressure from energy costs, combined with unfairly low-cost imports into the UK and Europe, we've been left with no other choice. Our priority now is to support those affected and protect the long-term future of the site.\"",
      "Brooks then took a swipe at the UK governments of past and present, stating: \"This is a textbook case of the UK and Europe sleepwalking into deindustrialisation. INEOS has invested heavily at Hull to cut CO2 yet we're being undercut by China and the US while left wide open by a complete absence of tariff protection.",
      "\"If governments don't act now on energy, carbon and trade, we will keep losing factories, skills and jobs. And once these plants shut, they never come back.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has faced a barrage of criticism for the job cuts made at United. In February, the club confirmed up to 200 staff members were at risk in the latest round of redundancies. This followed the United boss cutting its workforce by nearly a quarter, with 250 staff members being let go.",
      "Alongside the job cuts, it was reported current staff members would no longer receive complimentary hot meals, with fruit provided instead, along with soup and toast at Carrington, as part of cost-saving measures. In an interview with The Times, Ratcliffe responded to the criticism levelled at Ineos, saying: \"This summer we will 'buy' Antony, Sancho, Casemiro, Martinez, Hojlund and Onana and they're all about 17 million quid each, because that's what is outstanding.",
      "\"If we buy nobody else we're buying those players. But it will be a very profitable club. We believe in three years' time it will be the most profitable football club in the world. It will be in a very, very different place, but we need to go through the change. Nobody likes change.",
      "\"The changes that we've made over this season, plus the ones that have been announced recently [more redundancies], will put us in a position to be able to do that. At INEOS we run a lean organisation.",
      "\"As my mother said, you look after the pennies the pounds look after themselves. We can sound flippant about free lunches but if you give all these perks, first-class train fares, free taxis, it's not coherent. It goes bust at Christmas.",
      "\"We've made some really tough decisions and now we're seeing staff understanding what we're trying to do. There's a clear vision of what we're trying to achieve.\"",

      "Sergio Reguilon is set to return to football after three months without a club by joining Inter Miami, it has been claimed. The Major League Soccer club are on the lookout for a new left-back after Reguilon's fellow Spain international Jordi Alba confirmed this season would be his last.",
      "Regulon, 28, has been a free agent since leaving Tottenham Hotspur when his contract expired in June. He spent five seasons with the North London club but only made 73 appearances during that period, spending time out on loan at Atletico Madrid, Manchester United and Brentford.",
      "According to The Athletic, Inter Miami are \"close\" to a deal for Reguilon. However, the same publication notes that they are not expected to be able to play him in competitive matches until next season due to MLS' September roster freeze.",
      "The Floridian side are preparing for a busy summer, with Sergio Busquets also set to retire. There are also question marks over the long-term future of two of their other ex-Barcelona players, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.",
      "Inter Miami won the Supporters' Shield last term but fell short in the post-season playoffs. Another former Barcelona star, Javier Mascherano, took over as head coach ahead of the 2025 season and has secured a return to the playoffs with time to spare.",
      "If Reguilon links up with the club before the turn of the year, he will be able to watch Messi et all attempt to go all the way and win MLS Cup. The Argentina star is Inter Miami's top scorer this season with 32 goals in all competitions, with his 24 MLS goals putting him level with Los Angeles FC's Denis Bouanga.",
      "World Cup winner Messi has recognised his career isn't far from its end, and cut an emotional figure after what could have been his last competitive international appearance in his home country. \"I haven't made a decision about the [2026] World Cup,\" he said at the time. \"I'll finish the season then I'll have pre-season, and there will be six months left. So we'll see how I feel.\"",
      "Reguilon has played against Messi, Suarez, Busquets and Alba in the past, and was on the opposing side for a 2019 Clasico when Barca beat Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. He also started twice against the Catalan club during a spell with Sevilla and made two substitute appearances against them with Atleti during the 2023/24 season.",
      "He made just six appearances for Spurs during his final season back in North London, four in the league and two in domestic cups. He was left out of Ange Postecoglou's European squad for last season's run to Europa League glory, but attended the final in Bilbao and was spotted speaking to former United colleague Alejandro Garnacho on the San Mames pitch.",

      "A host of prominent figures are singing the praises of England star Marcus Rashford following a stunning start to life at Barcelona after his summer loan switch from Manchester United. The United academy product had fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim last campaign and he spent the latter half of the previous season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "His future dominated headlines this summer, with Hansi Flick's Barcelona emerging victorious in the battle for his services. And the England ace hasn't glanced backwards since making the move.",
      "The 27-year old-has now notched eight goal contributions across his previous seven outings, with his most recent strike coming in the 4-1 reverse against Sevilla.",
      "Ex-Barcelona man Gary Lineker has lavished praise on Rashford's introduction to life in Catalonia, revealing on the latest Rest is Football podcast: \"I'm pleased for Marcus [Rashford]. I don't think he could've had a much better start.",
      "\"I mean, admittedly, they lost this particular game, but through no fault of his. In fact, I think he was probably their best player.\"",
      "While delivering his assessment of Lewandowski's penalty miss, meanwhile, Lineker went on: \"It's funny, I was at home and thinking; 'Let Marcus take it [the penalty], he's a brilliant penalty taker' and obviously Lewandowski has taken them and I always knew he would take it, but I had a feeling and then he hit it wide.",
      "\"So Marcus will be champing at the bit, to I suspect, to get that gig, but I don't think he'll get it while Lewandowski is there because strikers, however many they miss, unless they miss possibly two on the bounce, they tend to keep taking them.\"",
      "Following his switch to the Catalan giants, numerous Barcelona players have heaped praise on Rashford.",

      "Hojlund, whom the Reds snapped up from Atalanta for £72m in August 2023, has appeared six times across all competitions this season, netting four goals. Playing a crucial part in Antonio Conte's squad, he has propelled Gli Azzurri to the summit of Serie A.",
      "The former England manager commented: \"Playing in Naples puts you under more pressure than at Atalanta, but the Dane seems to have matured thanks to his Premier League experience, which helped him realise his true value.",

      "Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim is \"inevitable\" and believes he will have been removed from his job before Christmas. Despite enjoying a third win of the season on Saturday the dark clouds are gathering at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim is about to celebrate his first anniversary as boss in Manchester, although there's been very little to cheer. Since he was appointed United have one of the worst records in the Premier League and that resulted in their worst ever campaign last time out.",
      "This year, despite a full pre-season and more than £200million of new talent arriving, little has changed and Amorim's philosophy is still not bringing any results. The Portuguese coach is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation, which has continued to cause problems for the players.",
      "The United hierarchy have claimed they are behind Amorim and he deserves a season to show what he can do with the team, but Carragher insists the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss won't make December 25.",
      "\"His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager – 50 games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",
      "During those 50 matches in charge of the club he has yet to lead the club to back-to-back Premier League wins, underlining his struggles. Last season's Europa League final loss - and the performance - was another blow for Amorim.",
      "Already this season United have been beaten by Arsenal, Manchester City and Burnley whilst they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in what was an all-time low.",
      "Carragher's view was backed by United legend Paul Scholes, who suggested the head coach has already outstayed his grace period given how long the poor results have gone on.",
      "\"I feel like with Ruben Amorim it's got to the point where we don't want to talk about sacking managers all the time and Manchester United do give managers enough time,\" he said.",
      "\"He'll never get booed by the fans and it wasn't until that Brentford game [where they lost 3-1] where I thought, 'He's getting a little bit too much time' and it feels like it's only a matter of time before things come to an end.\"",

      "Manchester United’s academy teams have become the latest to bear the brunt of cost-cutting measures, but that hasn’t stopped Darren Fletcher getting change out of his charges. Fletcher, now in charge of the Under-18s team, has overseen five league wins out of six while also overseeing wins against Brighton and Middlesbrough in the cup.",
      "It has been a similar story with the Under-21s, who have done even better. Travis Binnion is the man in the dugout there, and six wins from six leave United’s youngsters top of Premier League 2.",
      "All of this comes against a less-than-ideal backdrop. The Athletic reports that United’s revamped Carrington training base doesn’t have enough room to house the academy sides, who no longer enjoy some of the benefits they enjoyed before the redevelopment as Jim Ratcliffe's changes continue.",
      "The youngsters are now housed in temporary accommodation and no longer have a dedicated ground floor dressing room and treatment room near the first team. They previously shared some areas with first-teamers, but that interaction is now limited, though United say they have been waiting for the arrival of new academy director Stephen Torpey to arrive before work on a bespoke academy structure begins.",
      "The same report indicates there is currently a dedicated changing room for ‘emerging talent’ - set aside for academy stars when they train with the first team. Fletcher’s son Tyler is one of those to benefit of late, along with Shea Lacey - one of the youngsters who featured in United’s post-season friendlies back in May.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been through a lot during his time at United, rising through the ranks as a player and returning as a staff member after hanging up his boots. Since coming back to his boyhood club, though, the Scot has held a number of roles.",
      "He rejoined the club in 2020 as Under-16s boss, before later taking on roles as first-team coach and technical director. His role changed to technical coach in April 2024 and he survived coaching overhauls in Erik ten Hag’s final summer and Ruben Amorim’s early months before moving to his current post in July.",
      "The situation at Carrington might look like an easy excuse for results on the field to suffer. It has been nothing of the sort, though, with Fletcher's charges producing plenty of dominant victories.",
      "“I am really excited to take on this new role and increase my responsibility to directly develop our young players,\" Fletcher, 41, said over the summer. \"I’m looking forward to working with such a talented age-group; supporting them to reach their potential and preparing them to enjoy careers at the highest level possible.”",
      "“We are delighted that Darren will lead our Under-18s group,” director of football Jason Wilcox added. “He knows exactly what it takes to be a successful Academy graduate and has played a key role in shaping the pathway for so many of our young players in recent years.",
      "“Darren’s excellent relationships across the entire staff will only increase the strong connection between the Academy and first team, further enhancing our ability to produce world-class players ready to excel at Manchester United.”",
      "All the while, Fletcher has not one but two sons in the academy. Twin brothers Tyler and Jack have had different careers so far, with the former representing Scotland at age group level and the latter captaining England’s Under-18s for the first time in March.",
      "The siblings have continued to impress for United’s academy sides this term, and Jack was close to a senior debut last season. He made the bench several times under Amorim, including for the Europa League knockout victory over Real Sociedad.",
      "The 2025/26 season has been one of promise so far, despite the situation being far from perfect. And it has a considerable Fletcher flavour.",

      "Senne Lammens is already forcing people to revise their opinions of him following his impressive debut for Manchester United. The goalkeeper kept a clean sheet during the club's 2-0 Premier League win over Sunderland on Saturday after being picked to start ahead of Altay Bayindir by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Belgium international, who joined United from Royal Antwerp for £18million during the summer transfer window, turned in a solid display at Old Trafford. Such was the 23-year-old's command of his area that supporters even serenaded him with chants of \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\"",
      "One person who was originally sceptical about Lammens' arrival was former United keeper Ben Foster, who was at the club between 2005 and 2010 and now presents his own podcast. The ex-England and Wrexham star described the deadline day deal as a \"panic buy\" and \"desperate\" at the time the swoop was made.",
      "However, he now appears to have had a change of heart after praising Lammens' performance on his maiden outing. Foster has also urged Amorim to hand the No.1 spot to him permanently following the international break.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, he said: \"It was a brilliant debut. I think the debut is such an important thing for a goalkeeper for that club and he handled it with flying colours. They've got to stick with him now.",
      "\"If they're bringing him in now, just before the international break it's a statement, [saying], 'You're our number one goalkeeper now for the rest of the season. Let's see what you're made of.'\"",
      "According to reports, United officials have been pleased with Lammens since he made the switch from Antwerp. They are also said to believe they made the right call in pursuing the promising talent over a more seasoned professional such as Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Speaking on Foster's podcast, former England goalkeeper coach Dave Watson also hailed the shot-stopper's performance against Sunderland and credited Amorim for being patient in introducing him into United's starting XI.",
      "He said: \"For him not to get any criticism, and come through the game clean, it can't be a better start. That is an amazing platform for him to push on, and I will be really interested to see how he does.",
      "\"For all the stick that Amorim's had, I think it would have been easy for him to put him straight in when he did sign. I actually think he's been quite clever in waiting for the team to pick up a little bit.\"",
      "Lammens' emergence comes after Andre Onana was allowed to leave on loan following an error-strewn two years in Manchester. The Cameroonian is now reportedly set for a permanent move to Trabzonspor after joining the Turkish side on a season-long loan late in the summer window.",
      "Onana has enjoyed a more positive start to life with his new club, having kept two clean sheets across his first four appearances. Trabonspor do not have an option to sign him permanently as part of their loan agreement with United but are said to be keen to keep him regardless.",

      "Peter Schmeichel insists the job of a Manchester United goalkeeper is \"to save the team 10 points a season, not give them away\" as he issued his verdict on Senne Lammens debut at Old Trafford. The Belgian was bought into the club in the summer amid a goalkeeping reshuffle.",
      "Lammens was an unknown quantity and was signed whilst Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir were both at the club. In a surprising turn of events the Cameroonian, who had endured an error-strewn two years in Manchester, was allowed to leave on loan.",
      "That left Bayindir, who began the year as No 1, as the first choice under Ruben Amorim. He too has made notable mistakes with United struggling for results, eventually leading to a change against Sunderland.",
      "Lammens kept a clean sheet but Schmeichel insists too often in recent years United goalkeepers have given up points, when he was told their core remit was to ensure the team banked more points than they were perhaps entitled to, owing to their goalkeeper's performances.",
      "He told Monday Night Club: \"You think about the goalkeepers that we've had over these last couple of years and how many goals we've conceded from errors, nine errors already this season - it's too much.",
      "\"I go back to when I played, my instruction was and it was the same with Edwin [van der Sar] and David de Gea, we had to save the team 10 points a season, not give them away and that's what we've got used to in the last couple of years, goalkeepers giving goals away and therefore losing points. First of all, it's nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance.",
      "\"It's what you see, you see this young lad, he didn't really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "\"You'd expect that from any young goalkeeper these days - as that's how they're brought up - so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he's done that, he's a goalkeeper now, he's saving balls.\"",
      "De Gea, at his peak, was a hugely influential goalkeeper on the red side of Manchester. He picked up numerous individual accolades and was courted by the likes of Real Madrid. A number of the club's former players, Gary Neville among them, aired concerns over their lack of a quality goalkeeper before the season begun.",

The Salford-born midfielder spent his entire professional career at Old Trafford, and he's widely regarded as one of the club's finest ever players.",
      "During Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure, Scholes won 11 Premier League titles, 10 domestic trophies, and two Champions League medals. He also earned 66 England caps as part of the so-called 'Golden Generation' alongside Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand.",
      "However, his close bond with Ferguson and his status at one of the world's biggest clubs came with an unexpected downside. Speaking on The Good, The Bad, and The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and Nicky Butt, Scholes said: \"Do you know what I found with England all the time?",
      "\"Someone always used to pull you to say, 'Tell your gaffer I want to come and sign for you.' 'F*** off. You're here to play for England.' You know what I mean?",
      "\"They were obsessed. I always found the lads who weren't at big clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, United... I always felt they used England as a bit of a way to get a move to a big club.\"",
      "Scholes scored 155 goals and provided 82 assists in 716 appearances for United before hanging up his boots in May 2013. He saw his illustrious career at Old Trafford end around the same time as Ferguson's 27-year reign.",

      "\"We have to keep going. First of all, it’s Wales, so it’s a derby, it’s emotional and it’s a big crowd in Wembley. The competition is on to be in the squad first of all, to be selected; competition is on to be on the pitch and play.\"",
      "Then, England will jet off to Riga's Daugava Stadium to face Latvia in a bid to secure their spot at next year's World Cup. With only three matches remaining, England currently sits atop Group K, having secured five victories from five games, a comfortable seven points ahead of Albania in second place.",
      "Consequently, the Three Lions need just two more wins to officially book their ticket to the tournament. However, England could seal their qualification even earlier, depending on how Serbia, currently in third place, perform in their upcoming matches.",

      "Arne Slot will be eager to return to Premier League business and rectify his team's recent struggles as they seek to defend their top-flight crown. Equally, the international hiatus could prove hugely valuable given the club's lengthy injury list.",
      "With Liverpool's next fixture scheduled for Sunday, October 19, against rivals Manchester United, Slot will be praying he can field his strongest possible XI and that his international stars return unscathed from duty with their countries.",
      "Goalkeeper Alisson faces up to six weeks on the treatment table after picking up a hamstring problem during the Reds' defeat to Galatasaray in the Champions League last week. Speaking to reporters ahead of Liverpool's trip to Stamford Bridge, Slot said: \"Alisson is not a part of the squad tomorrow.",

      "\"But from there on, sometimes things can go a bit faster or a bit slower. It's always difficult to say the amount of days and weeks, but for the upcoming games he will not be part of us or the Brazil team.\"",
      "Alisson wasn't named in Slot's matchday squad against the Club World Cup champions, with Giorgi Mamardashvili getting the nod between the sticks. The Georgian is expected to keep his place for the clash with United, with the Brazilian still on the sidelines.",
      "Expected return date: November.",
      "Slot has revealed that Konate was substituted during the second half of Liverpool's encounter with Chelsea due to injury. The defender was spotted with a slight limp.",
      "The Reds boss revealed in his post-match press conference: \"I don't know if it is a big injury, but what I do know is he limped a little bit and when I asked him, he said he felt his quad a little bit.",
      "\"Then, for me, all alarm bells go off because in another sprint you never know if that is going to go good. It was also already a substitution I had in mind, maybe for a few minutes or a little bit later, because the right centre-back had a lot of ball possession and we needed to create from that position.",
      "\"We all know Ryan [Gravenberch] is quite good in that. It might be OK that he went off early enough, but it was clear I had to take him off because he was limping.\"",
      "However, according to Le Parisien, as quoted by the Liverpool ECHO, Konate is expected to link up with the French national squad during the international break, which provides an encouraging sign regarding his fitness levels. The centre-back is also reportedly confident about taking part in training sessions with France later this week.",
      "Expected return date: October 19.",
      "Robertson was also seen limping at the final whistle during Saturday's encounter with Chelsea, having apparently sustained an issue in the closing moments of the match. No official statement has been released concerning the full-back condition, but pundit Jamie Redknapp expressed serious concerns about the situation.",
      "Expected return date: Unknown.",
      "It has been confirmed that Endo will miss Japan's fixtures against Paraguay and Brazil over the coming fortnight due to an undisclosed injury. It remains unclear whether the problem persisted during the closing stages of Liverpool's encounter with Chelsea, where he entered the action as an 86th-minute substitute for Alexis Mac Allister.",

      "Expected return date: Unknown.",

      "Manchester United flop Andre Onana looks set for a permanent move to Trabzonspor, with club chiefs already exploring a deal. The Cameroonian goalkeeper joined the Turkish side on a season-long loan late in the summer window.",
      "His move away from Old Trafford came after a rollercoaster two years at Old Trafford in which his performances had been blighted by high-profile errors. Onana has enjoyed a more positive start to life with his new club, having kept two clean sheets across his first four appearances.",
      "Trabonspor do not actually have an option to sign Onana permanently once his loan deal expires but it appears that they are keen to keep him around regardless. As per The Sun, club chiefs have already been in touch with the goalkeeper’s camp and expressed their desire to sign him permanently.",
      "It is suggested that head coach Fatih Tekke has been left impressed with Onana’s performances, while his leadership qualities have shone. Talks with United over a permanent deal are anticipated to take place come the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils are yet to set a price for a permanent deal, having paid £47m to sign him originally from Inter Milan. Onana still has just under three years to run on his contract with United.",
      "Speaking about his start to life with his adopted employers, he said: \"I am very happy. I can say that I am very happy. I am starting a new project, a new adventure for me, I am very happy to be here. This is a feeling that makes me so happy.",
      "“I've never felt so much love from people around me. It's a wonderful feeling to be made to feel at home from the very first moment.”",
      "Trabzonspor president Ertugrul Dogan has already spoken out on a permanent move. He said: “Onana has just joined us, and we and the technical team are pleased.",
      "“He’s a player who cost his team €65 million, including bonuses. It’s impossible for Trabzonspor to make a transfer under those circumstances. If the technical staff is happy, we’ll see what we can do at the end of the year.”",
      "Onana, 29, made 102 appearances for United. But he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim this season having been replaced by Altay Bayindir.",
      "His only appearance for the Red Devils this season came in a disastrous Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town. Summer signing Senne Lammens now looks set to be United’s number one for the foreseeable future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United bosses have been blown away by Senne Lammens' attitude and start to life at the club. The goalkeeper has received nothing but praise from club figures and has impressed staff after 'often being the last' player to leave the training pitch.",
      "The gamble proved successful, as Lammens delivered a composed maiden outing in the famous red shirt. The Belgium international, who arrived from Royal Antwerp in an £18million summer switch, was only called upon to make three stops but looked authoritative throughout.",
      "He commanded his penalty area with confidence and appeared completely at ease between the posts. The Stretford End faithful even serenaded him with chants of \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" suggesting the supporters have warmed to Lammens remarkably quickly.",
      "With Bayindir recording the poorest save percentage of any Premier League goalkeeper this campaign, Lammens' introduction felt inevitable.",
      "Since his switch from Antwerp, United officials have been delighted with the shot-stopper and believe they made the right call in pursuing the promising talent rather than a more seasoned option such as Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez.",
      "According to the i paper, there's not a single negative comment about Lammens, with insiders revealing he's always the first to arrive and last to leave training. It's reported that Lammens is constantly putting in extra work, whether it's improving his distribution or other aspects of his game.",
      "Lammens' maturity is frequently mentioned, with the young player already having sorted out his own private accommodation and planning to stay at United for the foreseeable future.",
      "If he continues on this trajectory, he could leave as lasting an impression as David De Gea did during his 12-year tenure with the Reds.",
      "After Lammens helped United secure a 2-0 victory against Sunderland, head coach Amorim praised him post-match: \"Senne did a great job, gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this, clean sheet, is important for our team.\"",
      "Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko netted goals for the Reds, securing a much-needed win ahead of the international break. Amorim added: \"Yeah, and a clean sheet is really important.",
      "\"We didn't play well during all the game, but we had our moments. But if you look at the performance, it was a team. Focus, defending well, trying to kill the game in the second half. So, I'm pleased with that, and now it's [time] to move forward to the next one.\"",

And on the way back I went down the parallel road, Bury New Road, which has got the Jewish community right at its heart, and they're out on the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will remain the club's boss for at least another few weeks after beating Sunderland. Tensions were eased at Old Trafford following a third straight home win, though it's been speculated the under-fire boss could still have been fired heading into the international break.",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko scored one of United's two goals on Saturday and has been rightly praised by a certain club legend. Meanwhile, another United alumnus has raised alarm about the club's \"history disappearing\" after a tragic turn-out for the latest England squad.",
      "After a return of just two wins from his opening six Premier League games and a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, pressure has mounted on Amorim this season. But Saturday's triumph over Sunderland moved the club up to 10th in the table and alleviated some of that burden as club football breaks for the next fortnight.",
      "However, it appears Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are keeping a watchful eye over the managerial situation. That's after journalist Fabrizio Romano suggested defeat to a high-flying Sunderland side could have been enough to call an end to Amorim's tenure if the scoreline was bad enough.",
      "\"What is happening is also that Man United won the game against Sunderland and closed all the speculation, at least for the next few weeks, for Ruben Amorim,\" Romano said on his official YouTube channel. \"So they head into the international break way more relaxed.",
      "\"The new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, finally started and got a clean sheet – and so a very good start for Lammens and a very good result for Amorim. As I told you guys, Man United were not going to sack Amorim even if Man United were going to lose the game against Sunderland. Even in that case, he was not going to be fired.",
      "\"That was the plan of Man Utd unless completely crazy things happened, like losing, I don’t know, 3 or 4 or 5-0. But, for example, losing the game, I don’t know, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, something like that, Amorim was not going to be fired.\"",
      "In the latest episode of 'United players thriving away from Old Trafford', Rasmus Hojlund's rebirth has continued in fine fettle at Napoli. That's after the Dane delivered the decider in a 2-1 win over Genoa on Sunday, improving his record to four goals in six appearances since joining Antonio Conte's side on loan.",
      "Given United have already acquired a replacement in Sesko, it perhaps makes most sense to sell Hojlund next year if they can get the right price. And Napoli will have first dibs on his signature after agreeing a £38.2million purchase fee for next summer, having already forked out £5.2m for the season-long loan.",
      "Romano has speculated the former Atalanta's striker's fast start in Serie A this season is already convincing the figureheads in Naples. And unless they pull out of the obligated deal like Chelsea did in Jadon Sancho's case this past summer, it appears the £43.4m deal will indeed be done.",
      "Also speaking on his latest YouTube debrief, Romano said: \"Apart from the obligation they trigger or not, Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "\"Napoli see Hojlund as part of their long-term project, and so it’s a loan with a buy option that might become an obligation, but it’s seen by all parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer almost guaranteed.\"",
      "Save for the example of Marcus Rashford, there isn't a player currently on United's books called up to the latest England squad. And even then, Rashford isn't technically a United player given he's impressing on loan at Barcelona and looks unlikely to ever return.",
      "It was only last year United broke a 48-year streak when they failed to see a single player named in the October 2024 England squad. That pattern has persisted under Amorim, much to the chagrin of former United winger and six-cap England international Gordon Hill.",
      "In response to Thomas Tuchel's latest selection, he wrote on X: \"If what I was told is true, that there is not one Man Utd player in the England squad apart from Rashford who is not [at] Man Utd, it is absolutely disgraceful and tells me that my club's history is disappearing. I hope not.\"",
      "It takes talent to recognise talent, and among the litany of United's best forwards of all time, Wayne Rooney ranks near the very top. So it will have been a privilege for Sesko to hear United's all-time top scorer signing his praises this weekend.",
      "It was the Slovenian's quick-thinking in front of goal that put the Red Devils two up at home to Sunderland and sealed the three points. In response to Sesko's latest display, Rooney picked out three team-mates in particular who stand to benefit from his presence in attack.",
      "\"I think he’s a handful, and I think he uses his body well, he challenges for balls,\" he said on The Wayne Rooney Show. \"It makes it easier for [Bryan] Mbeumo, [Matheus] Cunha when he’s on, or Mount to make runs in behind him, so I think that’s clearly something they’ve worked on.",
      "\"Obviously getting another goal will help him so the win was massive for all the players and for the manager, and it was much-needed.\"",
      "After opening his Premier League account with a consolation in the recent defeat at Brentford, Sesko has now scored in back-to-back games. Fans will be hoping the international break does nothing to interrupt that momentum.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has hit back at Ruben Amorim by detailing three reasons behind his exit from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker moved to Napoli on a season-long loan deal during the summer transfer window.",
      "He had slipped down the pecking order at Old Trafford and was told he could leave by United head coach Ruben Amorim. Antonio Conte's side hold a £38million obligation to make the Denmark international's switch permanent next summer, meaning Hojlund may have already played his last game for United.",
      "Hojlund's choice to depart United this summer wasn't a simple one, however, as he had originally been resolute about remaining to battle for his position. Even when the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arrived, the frontman felt he could win back his place if given the opportunity.",
      "When he was in the USA for United's pre-season tour, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes.",
      "\"I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 [like Kevin De Bruyne]. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. I'm just focusing on continuing that. Competition is fine with me.",
      "\"It sharpens me, as I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Despite his initial position, Hojlund ultimately accepted a deadline day switch to Italian champions Napoli. So far this campaign, Hojlund has netted four times in six appearances in all competitions - matching his entire Premier League tally for United during the 2024/2025 season.",
      "Speaking about what finally swayed his decision and persuaded him to embrace the next phase of his career in Italy, Hojlund waxed lyrical about Conte while speaking to Radio Kiss. The ex-Atalanta player said: \"Conte is a top coach.",
      "\"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Following six matches, reigning champions Napoli currently lead the Serie A standings, and remain on course to retain the title they secured last season, boasting five victories and just one defeat from their campaign. Hojlund isn't the sole former Manchester-based star flourishing with the Italian outfit at present, either.",
      "Scott McTominay has enjoyed a brilliant spell with Napoli since completing his switch from United last summer, registering 12 goals and six assists in the league during the previous term. Meanwhile, Manchester City icon Kevin De Bruyne is also excelling, contributing with three goals and two assists from his eight appearances in Serie A and the Champions League so far.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Senne Lammens was handed a gentle introduction to the Premier League with Manchester United's comfortable 2-0 win over Sunderland at the weekend.",
      "Lammens, an £18.2million deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp, looked assured and untroubled as he secured a clean sheet on his impressive United debut at Old Trafford.",
      "But the 23-year-old is set for the ultimate test after the international break when he walks out at Anfield a week on Sunday for the clash against United's fiercest rivals and champions, Liverpool.",
      "Nothing will have prepared Lammens for the venom and hostility that will come his way, with Liverpool fans ready to leave him in no doubt over the hatred they reserve for United players.",
      "That is why the cauldron of Anfield will be the true barometer of the young goalkeeper's temperament and mindset, playing under the most intolerable pressure and relentless intimidation.",
      "The Liverpool fans who will spend the whole game trying to put him off for the 90 minutes will hoping they succeed and that it is a case of 'Lammens to the Slaughter' by the end of the acrimonious encounter.",
      "That Lammens has impressed United's goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, and his staff will come as no surprise to anyone who witnessed his confident display against the newly-promoted Black Cats.",
      "Those who work closely with Lammens on a daily basis at United have been struck by how mature he is for his age, given his relative inexperience when it comes to playing at the highest level.",
      "“He's got a very calm personality and seems to be taking everything in his stride so far,” said a United source who sees Lammens at the training ground every day. “He's impressed a lot in training and everyone only has positive things to say about him.”",
      "Lammens credits his mother and father with his calm demeanour. “My parents are also really calm and collected,” he said. “From growing up, when I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life, I think one of the best attributes you can have is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.",
      "“If you want to be a good keeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence. They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in.”",
      "Off the pitch, Lammens -currently on international duty with Belgium - is as calm and settled as he is on it, having recently moved out of a Manchester hotel and into a house in the Cheshire enclave favoured by Premier League footballers, where he now resides with his girlfriend.",
      "He may have only been a United player for a little over a month, but Lammens has adapted to his new environment much quicker than many of United's recent new signings. He has enjoyed a meteoric rise, considering last season was his first full campaign as Antwerp's first-choice keeper, and he now finds himself occupying that role for one of the biggest clubs on the planet.",
      "That is testimony to his natural talent, strength of character and mental resilience, all of which will be tested to the limit at Anfield and the games to come if, as is surely the case, he keeps his place as United's No.1 ahead of Altay Bayindir.",

      "\"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Senne Lammens against Sunderland.",
      "That chant alone is enough to tell you how Lammens performed on his Manchester United debut last weekend. He made a confident first appearance and kept a clean sheet in a comfortable 2-0 win.",
      "United fans celebrated the goalkeeper claiming a cross like they would react to a goal and he was congratulated by Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw immediately after full-time.",
      "Ruben Amorim said of the 23-year-old: \"I think he looks confident in the first game, but the important thing is that the teammates help Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes, against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Explaining why Lammens' debut was delayed, Amorim added: “When Senne arrived here, first of all, Altay was playing, and then he arrives, and you can feel it, that he needs to adapt.",
      "\"New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So, it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now, it's just one game, and he needs to work because he needs to be prepared that in our club, things are really hard. But he did well, and again, he was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Amorim said before the game that Lammens was starting due to rotation, but it would be a huge mistake to continue to rotate his goalkeepers after the Belgian's strong debut.",
      "Lammens provided calmness and leadership at the back, something Altay Bayindir has been unable to do, and removing him from the team would be a backward step.",
      "United signed Lammens for £182.million from Royal Antwerp on deadline day having considered Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, but club chiefs were understood to be convinced that Lammens was the best choice.",
      "The biggest argument to sign Martinez over Lammens was that he wouldn't need time to adapt to the Premier League. The remaining arguments in favour of the Argentine were not as compelling.",
      "United scraped a win against Burnley on the eve of deadline day, and Amorim said: \"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.\"",
      "However, Lammens made it look easy against Sunderland and will become cherished by supporters if he can reproduce that level of performance consistently in the coming weeks.",
      "Fans are desperate to watch a decent goalkeeper again. They wanted to believe that they were watching the second coming of Schmeichel against Sunderland last weekend.",
      "United have been represented by some world-class goalkeepers in history, but they have also made their fair share of bad goalkeeper signings. Onana, Massimo Taibi and Mark Bosnich are just some on that list.",
      "De Gea and Edwin van der Sar don't buy a drink when they return to Manchester and Lammens is hoping to have a similar impact after sparkling during his first appearance.",
      "Amorim has been patient with Lammens - resisting the urge to introduce him to prevent damage to his confidence - and it made sense to finally play him against Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "The fixture was a huge opportunity to keep a clean sheet. He obliged and is now primed to face a genuine test in Liverpool after the international break.",
      "“He’s been really good, looks really sharp – I’ve been really impressed with him and I’m really looking forward to playing with him,” said Luke Shaw about Lammens after his arrival.",
      "Tom Heaton said: “I didn’t know too much about him. It’s only been a few days’ training but he seems like a really good lad; calm but a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive.”",
      "Mason Mount was the latest dressing room member to praise Lammens when he spoke after Sunderland, saying: \"Senne coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben (Sesko) and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.\"",
      "You cannot blame United fans for getting carried away about Lammens' potential. And the £18.2m transfer fee could prove to be a bargain if he develops into the player United scouts believe he can become.",

      "Senne Lammens has created a strong first impression at Manchester United having made his debut in the weekend win over Sunderland.",
      "The 23-year-old replaced Altay Bayindir between the posts against the Black Cats and kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win.",
      "Lammens signed for £18.1million from Royal Antwerp on deadline day in the summer and has had to wait for his chance but having been given an opportunity, the early signs are positive for the Belgium stopper.",
      "He's certainly impressed his team-mates while the pundits were effusive in their praise after the win over Sunderland.",
      "United great Wayne Rooney, speaking on Match of the Day, said: \"It was a big decision (to play him), it is difficult to be the goalkeeper at Manchester United but I thought he did really well for the majority of the game.",
      "\"When you want your goalkeeper to make a save, he made a save. \"The one hiccup he had was when he made the wrong decision and came out and on another day it could have cost him and cost Manchester United.",
      "\"In the main I thought he did a lot of good things. And what everyone wants is when the ball goes into the box you want a keeper who can come and command, catch the ball and I thought it was a good, solid debut for him.\"",
      "Inside the dressing room, Lammens' new team-mates have been impressed. Mason Mount, who opened the scoring against Sunderland, said: \"Senne coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben (Sesko) and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.\"",
      "And both Luke Shaw and Tom Heaton delivered positive first impressions in the immediate aftermath of Lammens' arrival.",
      "“He’s been really good, looks really sharp – I’ve been really impressed with him and I’m really looking forward to playing with him,” said Shaw.",
      "Heaton added: “I didn’t know too much about him. It’s only been a few days’ training but he seems like a really good lad; calm but a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive.”",
      "That translated into his debut with Peter Schmeichel pleased with what he saw, even if he preached caution given Lammens' age and lack of experience.",
      "\"First of all, it's nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance,\" he told the Monday Night Club.",
      "\"It's what you see, you see this young lad, he didn't really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "\"You'd expect that from any young goalkeeper these days - as that's how they're brought up - so there was some resemblance to Edwin (van der Saar), a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he's done that, he's a goalkeeper now, he's saving balls.",
      "\"From that, I think his confidence grew, you could see from the first cross, Matthijs de Ligt's reaction was fantastic, defenders want that when they're under the cosh to take some of that pressure off.",
      "\"It's far too early to talk about it, how good this guy is, he's only young, he's hardly played any competitive football, he's most certainly not at Man Utd.",
      "\"Unfortunately we've seen over the years, great players come into Man Utd and the pressure is relentless - then they can't deal with that. It would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him.",
      "\"He did well, he's got an international break now then the next game he's got to do the same.",
      "\"Then we see how he develops, all goalkeepers make mistakes, that's when we find out how good people are, in how do they react to those mistakes? It was nice, clean and positive, things that we haven't been used to.\"",
      "And Rio Ferdinand was impressed with Lammens' ability to dominate his box, a quality that Bayindir has lacked during his United appearances to date.",
      "\"For a goalkeeper to come out, you know the feeling when a keeper, when a ball’s coming in the box and they’re a big team, aggressive, and the keeper comes out and claims it, that feeling of looking down at him on the floor when he’s getting back up and you go, you know what, that’s my keeper,\" he said, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"That’s my goalkeeper, do you know what I mean? I don’t think they’ve been able to say that for a while because there’s been so many different mistakes and whatnot that’s gone on in questionable decision making. But he just looked very, very, very secure.\"",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways with a much-needed 2-0 win at home to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon.",
      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko eased the pressure on Reds boss Ruben Amorim after a week of intense scrutiny of his position at Old Trafford. Amorim's side were lacklustre in defeat at Brentford last weekend but enjoyed a positive day at M16 against the Black Cats.",
      "On the transfer front, former United scout Mick Brown has claimed his old club are interested in signing the Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo. While a report from Spain has claimed Barcelona are exploring their options to keep Marcus Rashford at the club without activating the option-to-buy clause included in the loan deal.",
      "Paul Scholes has also named Eddie Howe as an ideal replacement for Amorim – and Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Senne Lammers.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day.",
      "Rio Ferdinand believes Ruben Amorim could have been sacked by Manchester United had his side been beaten by Sunderland.",
      "“I think there would have been serious conversations being had if they had not beaten Sunderland,” he told his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "“I didn’t want to say it before the game but after the result the previous week, if they had lost to Sunderland I think it would’ve been a difficult conversation for Ineos to not consider relieving him of his duties.",
      "“He’s got to live another day, that’s what we’ve been talking about, ‘can you get some results? Can you find some consistency?’",
      "“In an ideal world, performances will be key in that but I don’t think we’re in a position to be worrying about performances, you need to get points on the board, get the team getting momentum and getting up the league.”",
      "Adam Wharton has cast fresh doubt over Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace future amid ongoing links to Manchester United.",
      "Despite a 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday, Ruben Amorim remains under pressure following a poor start to the season.",
      "A host of names have been linked with replacing Amorim should he be dismissed.",
      "One of those is Glaner, who guided Palace to FA Cup glory last season, and has already entered the last 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park.",
      "The Austrian recently revealed that he is aware of the rumours linking him with a move to United and confirmed last week that he is yet to be offered a new deal by Palace.",
      "\"Obviously there is always speculation with people's contracts coming up, but you've seen the impact he's had here and the way we are playing, so the longer he stays, the better I think,\" Wharton said. \"But anything could happen, so we will see.”",
      "Former Manchester United scout Mick Brown has claimed his old club are interested in signing the Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, he said: “He’s been excellent since the start of last season really, and has performed above the level I thought he was capable of when I first saw him play which I’m happy to say.",
      "“He’s so instrumental in what Bournemouth do, he scores goals, gives them power and running ability, and he does so well technically and creatively as well.",

      "There was speculation that Saturday’s home game with Sunderland could have been his last if the result went against United, but a 2-0 win appears to have bought him until after the international break at least.",
      "Speaking ahead of the game on his BBC podcast, Rooney expressed his exasperation at the club’s progress, or lack thereof, under Amorim, who has failed to secure back-to-back league wins after almost a year in charge.",
      "A good result at the weekend. A high-pressure game for the manager, the players, the club and I thought they played really well, [they were] efficient.",
      "I want and do hope that Amorim does well and the form turns around. As I’ve said, he’s a fantastic young manager but if you’re not getting results, the pressure is going to come on you. I really do hope he turns it around.",

      "Trabzonspor have already decided that they want to sign Andre Onana permanently from Manchester United, just one month into his loan spell at the club.",
      "The Sun have reported that Trabzonspor head coach Fatih Tekke has been impressed with Onana's leadership qualities and how he has adapted to Turkey, as well as his ability as a goalkeeper.",

      "He said on his podcast: “That must instil so much confidence in the back line, and then it spreads through the team.

      "Let's get into the news.",
      "Manchester United and manager Ruben Amorim could be gearing up for a significant January transfer window, provided the Portuguese boss remains at the helm at Old Trafford.",
      "The club have only managed to secure 10 points from their first seven Premier League matches this season. With three losses already under their belt, not to mention a deeply disappointing defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Amorim is feeling the heat.",
      "A 2-0 home victory against Sunderland on Saturday alleviated some of these worries, but a challenging trip to Anfield looms and a poor result there could negate any progress made. If Amorim stays in charge until January, it's inevitable that some squad changes will need to occur.",

      "However, he did play a key role in Chelsea's opening goal during their impressive 2-1 win at home to Liverpool on Saturday evening.

      "A host of names have been linked with replacing Amorim should he be dismissed. One of those is Glasner, who guided Palace to FA Cup glory last season, and has already entered the last 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park.",
      "The Austrian recently revealed that he is aware of the rumours linking him with a move to United and confirmed last week that he is yet to be offered a new deal by Palace. Wharton has now admitted that while the players want him to stay, nothing is certain.",
      "\"Obviously there is always speculation with people's contracts coming up, but you've seen the impact he's had here and the way we are playing, so the longer he stays, the better I think,\" Wharton said. \"But anything could happen, so we will see.”",
      "Speaking after the victory over the Black Cats, Mason Mount insisted that his team-mates are backing Amorim to turn things around. He said: \"We’re 100% behind the gaffer. We've had some results that hurt us - the team, the staff and the fans - but that was important today.",
      "\"It needs to be the start of building something. We thought after winning against Chelsea it would be the start of something and then we go to Brentford and have a disappointing result.",
      "\"It starts today and we'll be working hard over the break. We want to get back-to-back wins, then three in a row and push on for the top four.\"",

      "\"Being with the manager, is [the mentality of] 'I will kill myself to do anything in every transition'. We need to show with actions. I felt it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.",

      "\"In this game we didn't play well in the second half but we were focused, we fought hard for second balls, these small things are going to help us win games but big teams during the season, if they are not playing well the opponents are also not playing well.\"",

      "Jamie Carragher reckons Manchester United dismissing Ruben Amorim is \"inevitable\" and believes he will have been axed from his position before Christmas. Despite securing a third victory of the campaign on Saturday, the major issues persist at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim is approaching his first anniversary as manager in Manchester, though there's been precious little to celebrate. Since his appointment, United have recorded one of the poorest records in the Premier League, culminating in their most dismal campaign last term.",
      "This season, despite benefiting from a complete pre-season and over £200million worth of fresh talent arriving, minimal progress has been made and Amorim's approach continues to yield no positive outcomes. The Portuguese manager remains committed to his 3-4-3 system, which has persistently created difficulties for the squad.",
      "The United leadership have stated they support Amorim and believe he merits a full season to demonstrate his capabilities with the side, yet Carragher maintains the former Sporting Lisbon chief won't survive until December 25.",
      "\"His stats are unbelievable for a Manchester United manager – 50 games as Manchester United manager, he's only scored two more goals than he's conceded.\"",
      "Throughout those 50 fixtures at the helm, he has failed to secure consecutive Premier League victories, highlighting his difficulties. The previous campaign's Europa League final defeat - along with the display - represented another setback for Amorim.",
      "This term alone, United have suffered losses to Arsenal, Manchester City and Burnley, while they were eliminated from the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby in what constituted an unprecedented low point.",
      "Carragher's assessment received support from United icon Paul Scholes, who argued the manager has already exceeded his honeymoon period considering the duration of poor results.",
      "\"I feel like with Ruben Amorim it's got to the point where we don't want to talk about sacking managers all the time and Manchester United do give managers enough time,\" he said.",
      "\"He'll never get booed by the fans and it wasn't until that Brentford game [where they lost 3-1] where I thought, 'He's getting a little bit too much time' and it feels like it's only a matter of time before things come to an end.\"",

      "Manchester United's academy teams have been hit by changes imposed under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but this hasn't deterred Darren Fletcher from extracting the best from his squad. Fletcher, currently managing the Under-18s team, has secured five league victories out of six and also celebrated wins against Brighton and Middlesbrough in the cup.",
      "The Under-21s have fared even better under the guidance of Travis Binnion, with six wins from six putting United's young stars at the top of Premier League 2. However, these successes come amidst challenging circumstances.",
      "According to The Athletic, United's refurbished Carrington training base lacks sufficient space for the academy sides, who have lost some privileges they previously enjoyed before Ratcliffe's alterations took effect. So far, though, Fletcher and his squad have been able to overcome this disruption.",
      "The young players are now accommodated in temporary housing and no longer have a dedicated ground floor dressing room and treatment room near the first team. They used to share some facilities with the first-team players, but that interaction is now limited.",
      "United have said they were awaiting the arrival of new academy director Stephen Torpey before initiating work on a customised academy structure. Torpey's hiring was confirmed in August, and the former Brentford man took the reins from Nick Cox the following month.",
      "The Athletic also indicates there is presently a designated changing room for 'emerging talent' - reserved for academy prospects when they train alongside the first team, as well as those fully brought into the senior group. Fletcher's son Tyler is amongst those to have benefited recently, together with Shea Lacey - one of the youngsters who got game-time with the senior squad during their post-season Asia tour last May.",
      "Darren Fletcher, who came through the academy as a player and made hundreds of senior appearances, returned as a member of staff after retiring from playing. Since rejoining his boyhood club, however, the former Scotland midfielder has experienced considerable upheaval and occupied numerous positions within the club.",
      "He returned to the club in 2020 as Under-16s manager, before subsequently taking on duties as first-team coach and technical director. His position shifted to technical coach in April 2024 and he weathered coaching restructures during Erik ten Hag's final summer and Ruben Amorim's early period before transitioning to his present role in July.",
      "The circumstances at Carrington might provide a convenient justification for poor results on the pitch for others. The reality has been anything but, though, with Fletcher's team shrugging it off to record win after win.",
      "\"I am really excited to take on this new role and increase my responsibility to directly develop our young players,\" Fletcher, 41, stated over the summer. \"I'm looking forward to working with such a talented age-group; supporting them to reach their potential and preparing them to enjoy careers at the highest level possible.",
      "\"We are delighted that Darren will lead our Under-18s group,\" director of football Jason Wilcox added. \"He knows exactly what it takes to be a successful Academy graduate and has played a key role in shaping the pathway for so many of our young players in recent years.",
      "\"Darren's excellent relationships across the entire staff will only increase the strong connection between the Academy and first team, further enhancing our ability to produce world-class players ready to excel at Manchester United.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fletcher boasts not one but two sons coming through the academy ranks. Twins Tyler and Jack have followed contrasting paths thus far, representing Scotland and England respectively at youth international level.",
      "Both brothers have continued to shine for United's youth teams this campaign, with Jack knocking on the door of a senior bow last term. He earned several call-ups to the substitutes' bench under Amorim, including during the Europa League knockout triumph against Real Sociedad.",
      "The 2025/26 campaign has shown real potential despite circumstances being far from ideal. And it carries a distinctly Fletcher influence throughout.",

      "A number of high-profile stars and agree that Marcus Rashford is shining after joining Catalan giants Barcelona on loan from Manchester United this summer.",
      "The United academy graduate fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim last season and spent the second half of last term on loan with Aston Villa.",
      "His future was a major talking point this summer, with Hansi Flick's Barcelona winning the race for his signature and the England international hasn't looked back since then. The 27-year-old now has eight goal contributions in his last seven games, with his latest feat a goal in the 4-1 defeat to Sevilla.",
      "Ex-Barcelona star Gary Lineker has heaped praise on Rashford's start to life in Catalonia, telling the latest Rest is Football podcast: \"I'm pleased for Marcus [Rashford], I don't think he could've had a much better start. I mean, admittedly, they lost this particular game, but through no fault of his, in fact, I think he was probably their best player.\"",
      "While giving his verdict on Lewandowski's penalty miss, Lineker added: \"It's funny, I was at home and thinking; 'Let Marcus take it [the penalty], he's a brilliant penalty taker' and obviously Lewandowski has taken them and I always knew he would take it, but I had a feeling and then he hit it wide.",
      "\"So Marcus will be champing at the bit, to I suspect, to get that gig, but I don't think he'll get it while Lewandowski is there because strikers, however many they miss, unless they miss possibly two on the bounce, they tend to keep taking them.\"",
      "Since his move to the La Liga giants, several Barcelona stars have also given Rashford a glowing appraisal. After scoring a brace against Newcastle United in the Champions League, Barca boss Flick said: \"The important thing is that he gains confidence, and scoring two goals in this stadium, in his home country, will help him.",
      "\"We're helping him. But I'm not surprised. He's an outstanding player, with great talent, as I said. His finishing is fantastic. We need a player like him.\"",
      "Barca defender Ronald Araujo told reporters after that game: \"Marcus is spectacular. He does the same thing in training. We're very happy to have him with us, because he has a lot of quality and will help us a lot.\"",
      "\"It was incredible,\" goalkeeper Joan Garcia went on. \"He's already got us used to it in training. He has a very good shot, and I'm very happy for him because he's working hard and he's working well.\"",

      "Manchester United co-owner Ineos has confirmed it is set to cut 20 per cent of the workforce at its Acetyls plant in Hull due to \"direct result of sky-high energy costs and anti-competitive trade practices\".",
      "Confirming the news to employees this week, a total of 60 jobs are set to be lost. Ineos have blamed \"dirt-cheap carbon-heavy imports from China\", which are produced using coal.",
      "The company has stated that these Chinese products have been blocked from entering the United States, though there are no trade barriers in the UK or Europe.",
      "CEO of Ineos Acetyls, David Brooks, said: \"This is a very difficult time for everyone at the Hull facility. We have a leading-edge, efficient and well-invested site and the team here is highly skilled, professional, and dedicated.",
      "\"Making the decision to cut 60 roles was not taken lightly. We have explored every possible alternative but in the face of sustained pressure from energy costs, combined with unfairly low-cost imports into the UK and Europe, we've been left with no other choice.",
      "\"Our priority now is to support those affected and protect the long-term future of the site.\"",
      "He added: \"This is a textbook case of the UK and Europe sleepwalking into deindustrialisation. INEOS has invested heavily at Hull to cut CO₂, yet we're being undercut by China and the US while left wide open by a complete absence of tariff protection.",
      "\"If governments don't act now on energy, carbon and trade, we will keep losing factories, skills and jobs. And once these plants shut, they never come back.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been heavily criticised for the redundancies made at United. In February earlier this year, the club confirmed that up to 200 staff members were at risk in the latest round of cuts.",
      "It came after the United chief slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter, with 250 staff members being laid off. Along with the job cuts, reports emerged that current staff members will no longer receive free hot meals, with fruit provided instead, along with soup and toast at Carrington, in an effort to save money.",
      "Speaking to The Times, Ratcliffe reacted to the criticism placed on Ineos. \"This summer we will ‘buy’ Antony, Sancho, Casemiro, Martinez, Hojlund and Onana and they’re all about 17 million quid each,” he said. “Because that’s what is outstanding. If we buy nobody else we’re buying those players.",
      "“But it will be a very profitable club. We believe that in three years’ time it will be the most profitable football club in the world. And it will be in a very, very different place. But we need to go through the change. Nobody likes change.\"",
      "“The changes that we’ve made over this season, plus the ones that have been announced recently [more redundancies], will put us in a position to be able to do that,” he added.",
      "“At INEOS we run a lean organisation. As my mother said, you look after the pennies, the pounds look after themselves. We can sound flippant about free lunches but if you give all these perks, first-class train fares, free taxis, it’s not coherent. It goes bust at Christmas.",
      "“We’ve made some really tough decisions and now we’re seeing staff understanding what we’re trying to do. There’s a clear vision of what we’re trying to achieve.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has said not even the Pope could make him change his Manchester United formation.",
      "Many argued Amorim's stubbornness would cost him his job following defeat to Brentford, but he made a significant change to secure a much-needed win against Sunderland.",
      "Senne Lammens punted the ball from almost every goal-kick. Diogo Dalot launched long throw-ins into the penalty area. There was a simplicity to United's approach that was reminiscent of a bygone era.",
      "United were direct and reverted to basics. It was a greatly effective change from Amorim, who secured a comfortable 2-0 victory to survive during the October international break.",
      "Amorim even ditched the beige chinos in favour of wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline, which felt appropriate given United played like a Stoke City team put together by Tony Pulis.",
      "There is no doubting that Amorim is a stubborn manager, but a leopard can change its spots.",
      "The 40-year-old did what was necessary against Sunderland - he tweaked to secure a victory. And it would be unfair to suggest United only secured the win due to their newfound directness, as every player delivered strong performances and there were some quality individual contributions on the ball.",
      "Amorim was asked if he was frustrated at the timing of the international break, given the team could build momentum, and responded: “There is no momentum with our team.",
      "\"So with a break, without a break… we know what happened when we win one game. And then for me, the frustration is not to see the same team at home and away.",
      "\"And you saw today, we didn't play well in the second half, but we were focused. We fight second balls. Ben [Sesko] was there to touch the ball all the time. So, these small things are going to help us win games. And sometimes you have your moments. First half, we had a lot of moments.",
      "\"But then in the second half, if we cannot play well, they will not play well, and that is the way a big team play during the season. So, that is the big frustration.”",
      "United sources were forced to clarify that Amorim retained the backing of the board after the Brentford defeat, communicating for the second time this season that he was safe.",
      "However, it's rare for a manager to recover once those enquiries begin and a win against newly promoted opposition at Old Trafford won't save Amorim if the situation sours when domestic football resumes.",
      "He was right to bemoan the team's lack of consistency when he spoke during his post-Sunderland press conference, because that is the problem undermining any progress.",
      "The failure to win back-to-back Premier League games is not good enough, although the events of the last week have made the upcoming Liverpool fixture an entirely different proposition.",
      "United will take on Liverpool at Anfield after the October international break. That game looked ominous for Amorim in the fixture list, but Liverpool are suddenly in crisis after losing against Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "There was a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley. They hadn't performed well and were bailed out by a few late goals.",
      "Liverpool will lick their wounds and the bookmakers will make them heavy favourites to beat United at Anfield, but the door is clearly ajar for Amorim to secure a tenure-making result.",
      "Slot has form for complaining when Liverpool's opponents don't play into their hands. He dislikes when a team plays direct, like United did against Sunderland - but there is no right way to play football.",
      "\"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throws,\" said Slot after facing Newcastle. The Liverpool manager admitted he doesn't like being dragged into a battle.",
      "United have not won away at Anfield since January 2016 when Wayne Rooney scored a late goal to settle a scrappy encounter, and Amorim would snap your hand off for a similarly dogged win in Merseyside.",
      "The Sunderland performance provided a blueprint to beat the Premier League champions.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",

      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",

The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",

      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

The English club believes signing Raphinha could make a difference in rebuilding its squad.’",
      "‘One of the key factors that could play in Barça’s favour is that, shortly before the most intense rumors emerged, they renewed the player’s contract until June 2028. This gives them a strong position to negotiate or even reject offers that don’t convince them.’",

      "We have bits on Arsenal and Crystal Palace too.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Before the season started I wrote in saying how I’d be very happy if United reached the second international break with 12 points. Well so far we’ve had two terrible performances against City and Brentford, two good performances against Arsenal and Sunderland, two half and half performances against Fulham and Burnley, then one sort of good but also sort of not performance against Chelsea. A properly mixed bag resulting in 10 points.",
      "I’m not happy with that but given the fine margins involved I am content for the moment. If Bruno scores that penalty against Fulham or Collins is sent off in the Brentford game (as Webb has now admitted should have happened) then perhaps we’d be where I wanted. No amount of whataboutery could put a positive spin on this season so far though I think it’s reasonable to say United are within the margins of error for my preseason expectations.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re not good and have been embarrassing at times, but outside of the Grimsby result I don’t think there is enough to seriously consider a managerial change at the moment. I think much of the despair from fans and the pressure on Amorim is linked with that cup exit which will linger and even grow until a decent run of form is achieved.",
      "Speaking of which, the next yardstick I suggested preseason was around 30 points by Christmas. Beyond the next game away at Liverpool where I expect no points (regardless of their tiny blip in form they are massive favourites for the win) there will be 9 league games to achieve this. So at minimum its 5 wins and a few draws to stay within the margin of error of +/- one result. There are some particularly tough games in that run (Spurs, Palace, and Bournemouth) but the whole league is tough so if Amorim can’t get it done now he likely never will.",
      "He made a few subtle changes to his system against Sunderland with an almost 4-4-2 formation out of possession which may help going forward. However, the centre back subs are getting a bit ridiculous now. I wouldn’t mind if there was any perceivable advantage. De Ligt has been great in the central role but is a lost and panicking mess whenever he’s asked to be a wide centre back. Why then keep moving him out there just so you can bring on Harry Maguire instantly making the defence significantly slower and more vulnerable? More than systems or formations or whatever its those kind of decisions that will cost us late goal and perhaps ultimately Amorim’s job.\nDave, Manchester",

      "The defending champions and the serial champions prior to them haven’t “clicked” but the team at the top of the table despite their injuries and tough schedule should’ve seen off the competition by week 6 of 38… because of net spend (we never talk wages though)? Ha!",

      "Similar to shin splints and unexploded World War II bombs, bogey teams were a real phenomenon in the 1990s but at some point in the intervening years, they fell away from the forefront of our collective thoughts. However, Everton appear to have brought the idea back: according to the Athletic, they have only won three times after conceding the first goal in the past few years, and all three of those have been against Crystal Palace. Happy to help, I guess.",
      "Despite the efforts of F365 and other parts of the football media, most people connected to Palace believe becoming a top four club is a bit of a pipe dream, but meaningfully reducing the gap between Palace and the top four is an admirable, achievable goal. This was brought into sharp focus, because if Palace were a top four club, David Moyes wouldn’t have been able to beat them.",
      "A curious game at the This Means Bramley-Moore Stadium, in that neutrals probably enjoyed it more than fans of either team, who will have mixed feelings about how their respective sides played. Crystal Palace completely dominated Everton for significant periods of the game, but only went in 1-0 up at half time against an Everton team booed off by their fans, then tired significantly in the second half, lost their composure, and ended up losing. The Toffees meanwhile, came out for the second half with a different setup (helped by some very effective substitutes), played their way into the game and came away with all three points.",
      "Like all winning teams, Everton’s winner had an element of fortune about it, but there’s no doubt Jack Grealish was in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing, when the ball rebounded off him into the goal. Bit of a rubbish way for the unbeaten run to come to an end but that’s just how it goes sometimes. I don’t think the defeat suggests anything too drastic needs to change for Palace, you can’t plan for players missing gilt-edged chances provided they keep creating chances, and you can’t plan to completely prevent players getting tired, only to mitigate the effects of their fatigue on the rest of the team. It says a lot about how far Palace have come that losing one game is newsworthy.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "The MailOnline really does need to be careful about calling this a ”racist’ outburst, by the way. That ground seems wafer thin.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments lamenting “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” does appear to have infuriated a great deal of angry, middle-aged white men who do indeed know exactly what they’re doing.",
      "It is definitely easy to see how Neville calling for togetherness and unity, denouncing “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and wanting “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony” has incensed and enraged so many people. He must have expected such incendiary, unpleasant words to evoke such a reaction.",
      "And after the single-person BOYCOTT, non-existent sack threat and really quite inflammatory quote marks around ”racist’ outburst’ when no-one described it as such because it wasn’t even close to being applicable, Tuesday brings a full-scale attempt to bring down the nefarious Neville.",
      "The charge is depressingly predictably led by angry, middle-aged white man Oliver Brown of the Daily Telegraph, who lays into ‘a degree of solipsism remarkable even by his own standards’ from Neville – a reminder that his great crime here is wanting people to come together and not hate and kill each other – before landing on that money-making quote:",
      "‘”We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer,’ Brown writes.",
      "‘After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.’",
      "And nothing says grift quite like knowing someone said “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” but actually hearing them say those angry middle-aged white men are ‘exclusively’ the problem.",
      "The people Neville ‘disdains’ are those who spread and incite prejudice and hatred based solely on nationality and the colour of someone’s skin. It is only ‘strange’ that we are supposed to pretend he is being unreasonable in that stance.",
      "It is also bizarre that a supposedly reputable journalist can write freely that Neville’s video ‘has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest,’ without any actual evidence of such. Are those ‘increasing threats’ in the room with us now, Oliver?",
      "‘Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience,’ Brown adds. Think he’s just acting as if he has an opinion and a platform, to be honest. So do you, and yet this is how you choose to use it.",
      "But of course, the ‘deluded’ Neville, much like Gary Lineker, ‘has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch’.",
      "If you want to just write ‘Keep Politics Out Of Football’ you can. No-one is stopping you, pal.",
      "This, by the way, is perhaps Neville’s ‘most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet’.",
      "Ah yes, that ‘dangerous’ rhetoric about wanting people to like each other and not be weaponised or led by hate speech. It’s some ‘self-parody’ from… Neville. When Mediawatch has an update on whether Brown has discovered the concept of irony we will let you know.",
      "",
      "Of course the Daily Mail have secured an anonymous interview with one of the builders on the development site Neville ordered a Union Jack flag to be removed from.",
      "Of course they accused Neville ‘of being unpatriotic and suppressing free speech’ while using his right to free speech.",
      "Of course he points to there being two other flags on the site which Neville did not demand were taken down, while adding that ‘the Union Flag was clearly visible from the street while the two others were more hidden inside of the site’, and not seeing the potential issue.",
      "MORE FROM MEDIAWATCH\n👉 Ekitike ‘breaks silence’ as Liverpool ‘cracks’ deepen for crisis-riddled table-toppers\n👉 Arsenal join fellow Big Six clubs in CRISIS as ‘Champions League problem laid bare’\n👉 Bellingham AXED and DROPPED in ‘baffling’ call after Tuchel ‘REFUSED’ shock request",
      "",
      "The MailOnline believe this furore to be enough to publish a lengthy feature on the man ‘who can’t stop injecting politics into football,’ as if he is on a hot goalscoring streak.",
      "They have at least downscaled that BOYCOTT to the rather less severe: ‘The broadcaster is now facing threats from some commenters online to cancel their subscriptions in response to Neville’s latest remarks.’",
      "And this article, most certainly framed as a criticism and hoping to paint Neville in a negative light, includes such paragraphs as:",
      "‘Neville has often shared his opinions on political issues, such as saying people should ‘detest’ the working conditions for migrant workers in Qatar and condemning Boris Johnson for ‘fuelling’ racism during his time as Prime Minister.’",
      "‘Neville criticised poor working conditions and deaths of migrant employees building the competition infrastructure and the Middle East state’s human rights record.’",
      "‘The millionaire Labour party member gets on well with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, having shared interview platforms with him several times – and previously criticised Tory ex-PMs Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, while also campaigning against Brexit.’",
      "‘His criticism of previous Conservative governments include the time in Downing Street spent by Boris Johnson, with Neville having used ITV coverage of England’s Euro 2020 semi-final victory over Denmark to say: ‘The standards of leaders in this country in the last couple of years has been poor.”’",
      "Suggesting people probably shouldn’t have been exploited, abused and even died while building infrastructure for a major football tournament? Saying Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Brexit were not great in terms of dividing the country? Sharing interview platforms with Keir Starmer?! All together now: What. A. Prick.",
      "",
      "It does appear that Neville has carelessly picked the wrong kind of free speech again. For confirmation we must regretfully head to the last bastion of such virtues:",
      "GB News: ‘An angry white man knows exactly what he’s doing with our flag. His name is Gary Neville – Kelvin MacKenzie’",

      "The 22-year-old scored six minutes into his Leverkusen debut and has played every minute of nine games in all competitions, retaining his place in the starting XI under Kasper Hjulmand after the comically brief tenure of Erik ten Hag. The German side have picked up ten points from their four games under the new manager, conceding just three goals.",

      "O’Riley said it was a chat with former Seagulls boss Roberto De Zerbi which persuaded him to make the switch to Marseille and it’s paid off so far, with the 24-year-old grabbing a goal and an assist in the most recent of four victories in the four games he’s played so far.",

      "If you wanted to learn how best to speedrun the all-too frequent flopping of young Manchester United footballers in the stress cauldron that that football club has become, Peter Schmeichel is putting on a clinic.",
      "A search for reasons as to why talented footballers arrive at the club and often briefly show promise before crumbling under the pressure should provide cause for introspection for the members of the Manchester United punditry caucus, who are absolutely just doing their jobs, but could also do with avoiding being so entirely hot and then cold, or vice versa, in their assessments of these players.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez,” Peter Schmeichel said just over two weeks ago. “In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time.”",
      "Lammens could be the kind of guy to use that as motivation, but may also have found it hard to ignore a legendary Manchester United goalkeeper a) admitting he doesn’t know who the f*** he is, b) insisting United should have signed someone else and c) ramping up the pressure by questioning his ability to cope with it.",
      "And yet, after one (one!?) appearance for Manchester United, in which the fans serenaded the 22-year-old with chants of “are you Schmeichel in disguise”, one would hope with their tongues at least somewhere near their cheeks given he didn’t do an awful lot, Schmeichel claimed there was “some semblance to Edwin [van der Sar]”.",
      "“First of all, it’s nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance,” Schmeichel said.",
      "“It’s what you see, you see this young lad, he didn’t really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "“You’d expect that from any young goalkeeper these days – as that’s how they’re brought up – so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he’s done that, he’s a goalkeeper now, he’s saving balls.”",
      "Schmeichel did caveat his praise for Lammens by insisting “it’s far too early to talk about if this guy is good or not”, but you can’t help but laugh at Schmeichel’s admission that “it would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him” less than a minute after comparing him to one of the greatest Premier League goalkeepers of all time.",
      "We get that he was asked about him and Lammens might not even be aware of what he’s said, but plenty of fans will have heard that and many will have read the article published by the official Manchester United website titled ‘LAMMENS: KEEPER OF PROMISE”. Again, after one actual game of football.",
      "We love a kneekerk reaction, and balls in a vice, we would say Lammens looks like the real deal. But we have no skin in the game. If anything, another United goalkeeper being terrible is much more fun and thus more clickable for the majority of our readers.",
      "Maybe Schmeichel and the rest of the cabal of United pundits are of a similar mind. Is it in their best interests for their former club to continue being a mess? If it’s not, we really think they should avoid comparing a goalkeeper with one Premier League appearance to another who’s won it four times.",

      "The Red Devils beat Sunderland 2-0 over the weekend to give Amorim a huge boost after a week of speculation about his future at the club.",
      "There were rumours that Amorim’s job could come under threat if Man Utd lost heavily to Sunderland on Saturday but luckily for the Portuguese head coach his side put in a decent display.",
      "When asked if rumours of Amorim potentially being sacked have impacted the Man Utd dressing room, Mount said: “No. For us, it’s just focusing on what the manager wants and that’s in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "“Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.”",
      "Mount added: “Obviously, even in this season, we’ve gone through ups and downs, but we’re together. And we’ll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.”",
      "The Man Utd midfielder continued: “I have a good relationship with the manager. I don’t think it’s any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes as I have played it before in the past [at Chelsea].",
      "“So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I’ve done it before. So, I think that’s something that I obviously understand.",
      "“I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.”",
      "Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood liked what he saw from Man Utd against Sunderland with Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko impressing him.",
      "“It’s largely going direct to a centre forward who wants the ball, and getting players around him to help him.”",
      "Sherwood added: “Man United are playing direct to Sesko. I’ve never seen him have so many touches, which is pleasing to see. They’re not asking Lemmens to play out – he’s kicking it long – and it’s paying off.”",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is “having a negative impact on his players” with his post-match comments, according to former staff member.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has already identified the Premier League boss that he would install as Ruben Amorim’s successor if INEOS decide to sack him.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Man Utd are ‘quietly considering’ Unai Emery as their next head coach as Ruben Amorim comes under pressure, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream."

      "Napoli will almost certainly complete the signing of Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund on a permanent deal next summer, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League last season with only four clubs scoring fewer goals than Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "That led Man Utd to invest almost £200m in three new forwards with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all joining the Premier League club in the summer.",

      "The deal includes a £38m option to buy in the summer with Romano revealing that a permanent transfer is “almost guaranteed” at the end of the season.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Rasmus Hojlund, they see him as part of their long-term project.",
      "“It’s a loan with buy option that might become an obligation, but it’s seen by all parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer almost guaranteed.",
      "“Hojlund is doing very well, scored a brace in the Champions League, scored on his debut against Fiorentina and again against Genoa this weekend.",
      "“So Napoli are very happy with Hojlund and Hojlund is very happy with Napoli… and the idea is to continue together, to sign the player on a permanent transfer.",
      "“So Man Utd can already consider €6m for the loan fee and €44m for the future signing of Rasmus Hojlund. It’s really important news for Man Utd.”",
      "Senne Lammens looked solid in his first start for Man Utd as they beat Sunderland 2-0 over the weekend but insider Dean Jones insists that the Belgian “is not the guaranteed first-choice goalkeeper” and the Red Devils will probably look to sign a new stopper in 2026.",
      "Jones told our friends at TEAMtalk: “Lammens is not the guaranteed first-choice goalkeeper for the long-run – but he has given himself a chance of being No.1 for the next game. And that’s all he can hope for and focus on right now.",
      "“United seem adamant they are not going to commit to a first-choice stopper, because they want a genuine battle for the shirt on a week to week basis.",
      "“It felt like the decision to give Lammens his chance was overdue and he did well this weekend, so I personally think he has given himself the edge when it comes to starting against Liverpool after the international break.",
      "“But there is no way I would say he’s now going to establish himself as the first choice because I do believe Bayindir will still get games and I also think United are still on the lookout for another goalkeeper.”",
      "Jones added: “I’m pretty sure a new goalkeeper will arrive by the summer – and may even arrive in January if they can find a good option. Again, this is about competition and strength in depth.",
      "“Lammens knows the club rate him long-term but he is also aware that he is going to have to play very well on a consistent basis to keep the shirt.”",

      "We do understand the fear. To be called favourites is to invite tiresome accusations of bottle jobs if you end up second again. It’s no longer acceptable in the nuance-free culture war age even to just call second place first loser; second place is first bottler. When it’s happened three years in a row already and your last title is over 20 years ago, the reticence to accept the favourites mantle is understandable.",
      "But there is simply no avoiding it. Arsenal are the best team in the country, and their second XI is probably about the fourth or fifth best team in the country.",
      "They negotiated a horribly tough opening set of fixtures without suffering terminal damage – which was a valid concern given how little margin for error Premier League title challenges now permit – and they have now taken top spot as we hit the second interlull and look perfectly placed to really stretch their legs and open up a gap.",
      "Arsenal’s four Premier League games before the November international break are against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland.",

      "Newcastle’s defence and midfield were impeccably solid on Sunday, albeit against a Forest side and manager currently providing a real-time six-week definition of the word beleaguered, and their high pressing forced Forest into goal-conceding errors.",

Underlying numbers hint that they are defying gravity a bit with their four wins and 14 points, but there is undeniably a new-found steel about this very work-in-progress side.",
      "The glass half-full approach to it all is that Spurs have racked up a goodly number of points despite very obviously not yet entirely working out how best to go about marrying defensive steel and long-ball football with attacking thrust and craft in the many games where they will inevitably dominate the ball and the onus is on them to take the initiative.",
      "One early quirk of the season is just how much more effective they’ve been on the road than at home. They’ve now taken 10 points from trips to Man City, West Ham, Brighton and Leeds which is clearly a return any club would settle for.",
      "It’s comfortably the best away record in the league at this time, with the only other team unbeaten away from home – Newcastle – also winless and indeed goalless away from home.",
      "And yet Spurs have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "The two conspicuously bad league performances have both come in front of their own fans, against Bournemouth and Wolves, creating a truly ludicrous state of affairs: Spurs now have as many Premier League wins in four away games this season as they’ve managed in their last 17 at home.",

      "Xavi Simons showed some more glimpses of getting up to speed with things when finally given a proper chance in a proper No. 10 role with licence to roam wide, while Mathys Tel got a goal that could kickstart something for a player who has yet to show Spurs fans a fraction of what he’s capable of.",
      "But the closest of Spurs’ summer arrivals to serious individual praise is surely Mohammed Kudus, who is looking far more like the player we saw in his first year at West Ham than the second.",
      "Like Tel, there was an element of luck to his first goal of the season thanks to a deflection, yet like Tel he created the opportunity for luck to land on his side in a way perhaps no other player on the pitch could have done.",
      "It’s worth remembering when considering Spurs’ sometimes infuriating lack of creative flair in these early days under Frank that they are still without James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, either one of whom’s availability would go a long way to addressing the issues.",
      "But what they do have in Kudus is a game-changer. Nobody has more than his four Premier League assists this season, and there is already plenty of reason to think that his partnership on the right for Spurs with Pedro Porro is just getting started.",

      "A powerful example of how the Europa League group stage, so often seen as a burden and chore, can really help kick a season into life.

      "He now also has 94 Premier League goals – the same career total as Dimitar Berbatov. And the players he’s catching now only get more absurd in their iconic status in this league. He’s only one behind Ruud van Nistelrooy, and three behind Didier Drogba. These are absurd numbers.",

      "Judging a manager a month into the job on an okay performance in defeat at a place like Newcastle would appear on the face of it a madness. But Postecoglou’s problem is that he has so thoroughly torched all semblance of goodwill in far easier games where his foibles have been more ruthlessly exposed.",
      "Nobody would be calling this result a sacking offence if he’d managed not to lose against Swansea or Sunderland or Midtjylland.",
      "But the response of the home fans at the City Ground on Thursday night was enough to tell you the manager is already on borrowed time, and that no benefit of any doubt will be granted for subsequent defeats. We can’t really think of many comparable examples of fans turning so quickly and viscerally on a manager after their appointment. They don’t expect this to get better, and in fairness to them they have a body of evidence from Postecoglou’s previous Premier League employment that is hard to argue with.",

      "Carlos Baleba’s failed summer move to Manchester United has left no winners, with the Brighton star one of this season’s biggest disappointments…",
      "One of this summer transfer window’s most surprising developments came as Man Utd, despite apparently being at risk of going bust by Christmas, made an audacious move for Brighton sensation Baleba.",
      "This provided evidence of the Red Devils, for a change, being notably astute in the transfer market as a No.6 with such a high ceiling as Baleba had the potential to turn Ruben Amorim’s side into a competent team.",
      "One of Man Utd’s many glaring weaknesses is their lack of a mobile No.6 to glue the team together. Baleba would have fixed this problem, but this ‘dream’ scenario proved too good to be true.",
      "With United almost exclusively focusing on overhauling their attack, they did not have £115m left over to sign Baleba. Therefore, they shelved their interest until a later date and also opted against signing an alternative.",
      "The immense lure of Man Utd remains undiminished by their prolonged on-field woes, with Baleba reportedly joining a host of other players in favouring a move to Old Trafford despite being able to do better.",
      "But with Brighton refusing to play ball, Baleba is stuck at the south coast until January at the earliest, and it’s clear that this summer’s events have negatively impacted his performances.",
      "On Sunday, Baleba picked up a yellow card in the 20th minute and, for the third time this season, was hooked off by Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler at half-time, while he is yet to complete 90 minutes amid a string of sub-par performances this term.",
      "This time, Hurzeler claimed post-match that Baleba was subbed “because of the yellow card”, but the Brighton boss has previously accepted that the “incredible” star’s form has dipped following his failed move to Man Utd.",
      "“I’m confident that we will get the best out of him, I think he needs time, he’s a young boy, his development in the last year was incredible.” Hurzeler said.",
      "“Maybe it went a little bit too fast, there was a lot of rumours about him, he played an incredible season, but I always try to be humble with the players.",
      "“Because with young players, it’s normal that there will be some waves in their development, and at the moment, we have a wave, so therefore the only way to get out of it, is to try to keep working hard and try to use every training session you can have and try to get as many minutes on the pitch.”",
      "So, at the moment, the Baleba saga has no winner…",
      "The player is clearly hurting from missing out on a huge pay bump and a desired move to an elite club, which is proven by his uncharacteristic decline at the start of this season.",
      "Man Utd are still lacking a quality No.6, and without such a player, their severe defensive issues will continue to limit their progress under Amorim/his potential replacement.",
      "And Brighton have a seemingly unhappy player performing far from his peak and should Baleba’s issues continue, they would have little choice but to accept his sale for a fee significantly lower than £115m.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",

I can’t remember the last time we watched Manchester United, home or away, where there wasn’t at some stage, some sort of drama, whether it’s giving a lead away, or whether it’s a comeback or or whether it’s just rubbish.",
      "“I mean, for the first time ever I can remember in recent memory, there’s nothing to say about this Man United side. It was comfortable.",
      "“As soon as Mount scored, they never looked in any danger.”",
      "On Senne Lammens performance against the Black Cats, Nicol added: “I know it’s tough to call it on this game, but a couple of times Lammens came for crosses, he just looked as though he’d been there all his life.",

      "That is soon downgraded to ‘one football fan threatening to cancel his Sky subscription unless Neville was sacked’. And in an unfortunate oversight, this single-fan ‘BOYCOTT’ is not backed by a quote of any kind whatsoever from the person actually apparently calling for Neville to be sacked.",
      "But apparently ‘there were unfounded claims that the broadcaster had been ‘bombarded with demands’ to issue a response to Neville’s ‘outrageous claim”.",

      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",

      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65. Manchester United were expected to score 2.1 goals, which was roughly what transpired.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the second-highest saves percentage (82.8 per cent) in the league and only two keepers have made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",
      "No ever-present keeper had conceded fewer than Henderson prior to Palace’s defeat at Everton. Now only David Raya has given up more goals.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. Though the PSxG stat won’t account for the way he gave Tottenham the ball before their crucial second at the Etihad in his home debut for his boyhood club.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced three shots more than any other goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "Johnstone came in for the Carabao Cup win immediately after Jose Sa’s poor performance in the home defeat to Leeds and the Vitor Pereira has kept the ex-England keeper in his nets through a three-game undefeated run.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award needs to be on his game this term with only Burnley allowing more shots on target than Forest, all while Big John breathes down his neck. Sels emerged from the defeat at Newcastle with some credit, conceding two from a PSxG of 3.4 while Forest allowed more shots on target than in any other game they have played this season in any competition.",
      "",
      "Five clean sheets in seven games – still the best record in the Premier League – is keeping Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. He bumped his PSxG up against Arsenal, though that stat won’t highlight his mistake in giving Arsenal back the ball prior to their late winner.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "One of three keepers to keep out a penalty this season, Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as England’s No.1.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a very solid start to life in the Premier League, with no one having yet seized upon the fact one of the world’s best keepers is supposed to be shaky on crosses with two left feet.",
      "",

      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good.",
      "",
      "It was handy while his side had forgotten how to score goals that Martinez was slowly making amends with Villa fans after a summer in which he flirted hard with Manchester United. Though the goal conceded to Burnley has given the Argentina star a negative number here after he got lured into a shoving match under a corner, his late movement allowing a save-able header to bounce through his legs.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth have been expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Bournemouth’s first, from what should have been an impossibly-tight angle went through Leno but Justin Kluivert’s winner was unsaveable.",
      "",

      "",
      "Darlow has replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form looked to have given Daniel Farke a decision to make when Perri becomes available again after the international break. But Spurs scoring two from an xG of 0.6 hasn’t enhanced Darlow’s case for retaining the gloves.",

      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have if we accept the Bees need some patience while a remodelled team settles under a new manager. Defeats – both 3-1 – at Forest and Fulham cost Kelleher here, with the Cottagers scoring three from an xG of 1.0. But saving Bruno Fernandes’ penalty certainly helped.",
      "",
      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal has done for the £16million new boy here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle. But five was two more than Arsenal ought to have scored at the Emirates, say the stats. Does he come straight back in upon his return from injury after the international break?",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",

      "According to Fabrizio Romano, something “crazy” needed to happen for Manchester United to sack head coach Ruben Amorim after the Sunderland game.",
      "Amorim was under immense pressure heading into Saturday’s home match against Sunderland, with it even suggested that this was a ‘must-win’ game for the head coach.",
      "Man Utd headed into this game after losing three of their opening six Premier League matches, while also suffering an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Therefore, the Sunderland match was huge as Amorim and Co. looked to boost morale, and they earned a valuable and deserved three points as Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored in their 2-0 victory.",
      "This result moves the Red Devils up to tenth in the table, though Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked this season.",
      "Despite this, Romano has revealed Man Utd’s “plan” following the Sunderland game, with Amorim only to lose his job if something “completely crazy happened”.",
      "“What is happening is also that Man Utd won the game against Sunderland and closed all the speculation, at least for the next few weeks, for Ruben Amorim, so they head into the international break way more relaxed,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Amorim saves job in ‘must-win’ game to beg Manchester United question: was all the ‘suffering’ necessary?",
      "“The new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, finally started and got a clean sheet – and so a very good start for Lammens and a very good result for Amorim. As I told you guys, Man Utd were not going to sack Amorim even if Man Utd were going to lose the game against Sunderland. Even in that case, he was not going to be fired.",
      "“That was the plan of Man Utd unless completely crazy things happened, like losing, I don’t know, 3 or 4 or 5-0. But, for example, losing the game, I don’t know, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, something like that – Amorim was not going to be fired.”",
      "On reports linking Man Utd with Gareth Southgate, Romano added: “Man Utd’s message was quite clear and they never contacted other managers.",
      "“I spent basically the last 10 days telling you that Gareth Southgate was in the media, but there was never a concrete negotiation between Man Utd and Southgate or his representatives.",
      "“There is a very good relationship between Southgate and INEOS, but never a negotiation. And Man United wanted to show their support to Amorim.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, like Marcus Rashford, has enjoyed a renaissance since leaving Man Utd on loan, scoring four goals in six games for Serie A side Napoli.",
      "Now, Romano has explained why a permanent move in 2026 is already “almost guaranteed”.",
      "“For Hojlund, I keep telling you guys, the Napoli intention is very clear,” Romano continued.",
      "“Apart from the obligation to buy included in the deal – for €44 million – Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Hojlund and they see him as part of their long-term project.",
      "“It’s a loan with buy option that might become an obligation – but it’s seen by the EU parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer, almost guaranteed.”",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "Napoli will almost certainly complete the signing of Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund on a permanent deal next summer, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Liverpool) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Bournemouth) – £45m",
      "5th (Manchester City) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Crystal Palace) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Chelsea) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Everton) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Sunderland) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Manchester United) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Newcastle) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brighton) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Aston Villa) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Fulham) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Leeds) – £15.9m",

      "17th (Nottingham Forest) – £10.7m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",
      "=1st) Chelsea and Liverpool (11 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £9.13m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (10 games) – worth around £8.3m",
      "8th) Newcastle (9 games) – worth around £7.47m",
      "=9th) Brentford, Everton and West Ham (8 games) – worth around £6.64m",
      "12th) Leeds (7 games) – worth around £5.81m",
      "=13th) Brighton, Fulham and Wolves (6 games) – worth around £4.98m",
      "=17th) Bournemouth and Crystal Palace (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Aleksander Ceferin and UEFA *have* set a precedent allowing domestic league games to be played overseas. Claiming otherwise is disingenuous.",
      "While Forest ponder another managerial change, Ange Postecoglou faces the very real prospect of presiding over the Premier League’s shortest-ever reign.",

Two, that number will not be sufficient to win the Golden Boot, or probably even get that close. Good bit that he’s already scored two headers when all the evidence from Germany was that, despite looking precisely like someone who would score a lot of headers, he doesn’t actually score many headers.",
      "His penalty against Forest was the very definition of ‘aplomb’.",
      "",
      "Made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like now Alexander Isak has been signed.",

      "He’s already one of the early favourites for the PFA Player of the Year award but there are reasons to be worried about his early-season form. The fact he’s still third in the running here says a lot about how little anyone else has managed to do to put pressure on Haaland.",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",

      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",

      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",
      "\"It could not have gone any worse and I feel for him. He is a young manager and he has had a great start to his career, what he did at Sporting Lisbon was really special. But those results for a club of that stature are just beyond belief.",
      "\"You don't want to see anybody lose their job but I think it would just be better for everyone if they just shake hands and move on.\"",
