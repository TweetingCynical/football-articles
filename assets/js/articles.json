      "Arsenal players might publicly dismiss talk of them being title favourites this season, but deep down they will be well aware that this is their chance to end a 21-year wait. In fact, it is highly likely that Mikel Arteta, with his unique methods, has drilled it into their collective mindset that 2025/26 is their season.",
      "It has also been visible in the Champions League, where the north Londoners are one of three teams left with a 100% winning record after four games. There is no doubt that they are well equipped to win both competitions this season.",
      "Cristhian Mosquera was Arsenal’s least high-profile signing of the summer. When the Spanish centre-half’s arrival was announced, for a mere sum of £13million, few could have predicted that he’d deliver the kind of assured performances he has managed so far in his fledgling career in north London.",
      "Initially brought in as a back-up, Mosquera was thrown into the deep end at Anfield in August following an injury to William Saliba, where the 21-year-old’s calmness instantly eased the Gunners faithful’s nerves. His 12 appearances already this season, conceding only three goals in 10 hours of action, are a sign that he has the trust of his manager, something Arteta made clear from their very first conversation prior to his transfer.",
      "Mosquera told The Guardian: “Before I had decided [whether to join Arsenal], someone in my camp said, ‘The moment you speak to Mikel, there’s no way he won’t convince you.’ And that’s exactly how it happened. When the call finished, my destination couldn’t have been clearer.”",
      "He added when asked about his compatriot’s intensity: “Yes, totally, totally. He really lives for football, he was raised on it, experienced everything. You see that when he talks. He loves the detail, sees things other eyes might not. I’m so happy with him. He’s an incredible person and he’s helping me a lot. The staff have made it easy. Arsenal is an incredible club.”",
      "Arteta may need to use those same powers of persuasion if Arsenal ramp up their pursuit of Olympiacos starlet Christos Mouzakitis. The Greek central midfielder, 18, quickly became an important player for the reigning champions after breaking through last term.",
      "He has made 13 appearances this season, including a brief cameo against Arsenal when the two sides met in the Champions League in October, while registering two assists. His composure, ball-carrying ability and maturity have also earned him seven caps for the national team despite his tender age.",
      "With scouts from all over Europe regularly being spotted at Olympiacos games, there is believed to be an impending tug of war between Arsenal, Manchester United and Aston Villa over the talent. Caughtoffside claim Arsenal have sent scouts on over ten occasions this season alone, with Arteta said to be impressed with Mouzakitis’ passing range, technical ability and work off the ball.",

      "Karim Adeyemi was fined £396,000 after admitting to the possession of a pair of brass knuckles and a taser. The Borussia Dortmund forward saw his case concluded at a district court in Hagen in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and has avoided a public trial.",
      "He also will not be given a criminal record. Instead, he must cough up a fine which has been calculated at 60 daily rates of £6,600 (€7,500), 'in accordance with his salary.'",
      "The payments relating to the offence, which dates back to 2024, also started on October 30, as per The Athletic. German law prohibits the possession of either item, and can carry a sentence of up to three years behind bars.",
      "In an official statement, Adeyemi's club said: \"BVB always takes criminal allegations seriously and uses them as an opportunity to discuss them with its employees while respecting confidentiality obligations,\" reports the MEN - who have approached both the German Football Association and the player's representative for comment.",
      "It comes as the 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Germany, who secured qualification to the 2026 World Cup on Monday night with a 6-0 thrashing of Slovakia thanks to goals from Nick Woltemade, Serge Gnabry, Ridle Baku, Assan Ouedraogo and a brace from Leroy Sane.",
      "Manager Julian Nagelsmann was also questioned about Adeyemi's situation by reporters during a press conference on Sunday, but remained tight-lipped. He said: \"The issue is a bit too big before such an important game, for all of us and for German football. Therefore, I will not comment on any further inquiries - regardless of their nature.\"",
      "Thanks to his performances on the pitch for club and country, Adeyemi has reportedly seen interest from numerous Premier League teams, including Manchester United. While the winger is under contract until 2027, he is said to be unsettled with Dortmund as the January transfer window looms.",
      "Adeyemi has three goals and five assists to his name from 14 appearances this term, but clashed with BVB manager Niko Kovac recently when he was substituted, throwing a bottle at the bench in frustration. Speaking about the incident, the head coach said: \"I think that's unnecessary. It's okay that he can be angry sometimes, but that's unnecessary; he's an adult.\"",
      "As per Bild, Dortmund are hopeful of negotiating a new contract with Adeyemi, but his agent, Jorge Mendes, wants a £70million release clause inserting into any new deal at the Signal Iduna Park. It comes as Ruben Amorim may not opt to add more firepower to his side when they January transfer window rolls around.",
      "The Portuguese tactician is currently reaping the benefits of bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, as United sit seventh in the Premier League standings - unbeaten in their last five outings. Many fans may also argue that the manager would be far better off strengthening the heart of his midfield, considering Bruno Fernandes has dropped into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro.",
      "While United were linked with securing the services of Brighton and Hove Albion starlet, Carlos Baleba, for the majority of the summer, the Seagulls' £100m price tag proved too hot to handle. And while the club may choose to revisit their pursuit in a little over a month, they have also been linked with a number of other suitable players as of recent for a fraction of the cost.",
      "VfB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller is one name who has come up in conversation, while Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton has also been speculated as a transfer target. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson has also been suggested as a good fit at Old Trafford, as well as Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "However, it seems Sesko has avoided a serious injury, and could be back in United's squad within a few weeks.",

      "This schedule could see Sesko sidelined for United's Premier League clashes against Everton, Crystal Palace and West Ham.",

      "Antoine Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, which could leave Liverpool and Manchester United licking their lips. After finding himself linked with both clubs this summer, Semenyo committed his future to the Cherries.",
      "However, despite signing a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030, he could find himself on the move as early as January due to a new revelation.",
      "As per The Athletic, the Ghanaian's new contract holds a £65m release clause, which any club can trigger. It's said that Bournemouth have reluctantly 'accepted' that his future is out of their hands, and a January move could be possible.",
      "The report also details how Semenyo was valued at around £70m this summer, with his release clause allowing interested parties to secure his services for marginally cheaper come January. However, it is also claimed that Liverpool or United - or any other suitors for that matter - will have to activate his clause by a certain date to allow the Cherries to find a replacement.",
      "It comes as Semenyo recently dismissed claims that he was keen on parting ways with his current club. When pressed by Jamie Redknapp about his future recently, the Ghana international responded: \"I don't think about it too much.",
      "\"I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.",
      "\"How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well. I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",
      "After bagging an impressive tally of 13 goals across all competitions last season, Semenyo found himself at the heart of speculation surrounding a transfer to United or Liverpool, while Tottenham also showed an interest. In the end, United snapped up Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, while Liverpool welcomed the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Spurs also snapped up Mohammed Kudus in a £55m deal with West Ham United. However, with six Premier League goals to his name this term thus far, the clubs could once again register an interest in the 25-year-old when the transfer window re-opens in January.",
      "Despite spending big this summer, Arne Slot has failed to inspire performances from Liverpool this season, with the defending Premier League champions languishing at eighth in the table at present with six wins and five losses from their opening 11 outings.",
      "And while Manchester United have started to come into good form under the stewardship of Ruben Amorim, questions still remain regarding the suitability of Sesko as a sole striker, given his age and lack of top-flight experience.",
      "Elsewhere, Spurs may sit fifth in the Premier League standings, but with Semenyo holding a lead of two goals on their top-scorer in Richarlison at present, they may be open to the idea of bringing in the Bournemouth sensation as an upgrade.",

      "The midfielder was given 75 minutes as Thomas Tuchel's side ground out a 2-0 win against Albania in Tirana and wrapped up their perfect World Cup qualifying campaign. Wharton created the most chances in the game (three) and made his case to be on the plane to North America next summer.",
      "At half-time, Keane was asked about the youngster, who joined Palace from boyhood club Blackburn Rovers for an initial £18million in January 2024. \"I do like Adam Wharton,\" Keane said on ITV.",
      "\"A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be, 'Can I go sideways or backwards?' What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is, 'Can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have.",

      "\"Go, 'Give me the ball!' That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. 'Give me the ball!' Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Last week, Wharton - who's helped Palace win the FA Cup and Community Shield this year - was asked about the speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford and he gave an interesting response. \"I don't really look into it or think too much about it,\" the 21-year-old told The Athletic.",
      "\"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me. My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, 'Is it true this club's interested?' I'm like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn't know'.\"",
      "When pressed on United's interest, Wharton replied: \"I don't know who's spreading it or who at United is looking at it. I see it and I'm like, 'Okay', and then I carry on with my day.",

      "Nottingham Forest are understood to have categorically ruled out selling Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window amid interest from Manchester United in the England midfielder.",
      "Anderson, 23, has been installed as one of the Red Devils’ prime targets as Ruben Amorim plots a complete overhaul of his midfield. A £100m price tag has been touted for the player, albeit it remains to be seen whether United would be able to stump up such a fee. And it has now emerged that Forest have no intention of sanctioning a mid-season sale with the January transfer window opening in a matter of weeks.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Forest will NOT be tempted into selling Anderson in the winter window as they attempt to turn their season around under their new head coach, Sean Dyche. They are anticipating interest next summer, though, with United and Anderson’s former club Newcastle known to be among those keen on signing him.",
      "Anderson, who signed for £15m from Newcastle last summer, penned a five-year contract at the City Ground. The report goes on to suggest that there is no buy-back or sell-on clause written into Forest’s agreement with Newcastle.",
      "Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis will set the club’s valuation of their star midfielder, which could rise over £100m. Speaking about Anderson recently, Newcastle icon Alan Shearer said: \"It [Anderson’s exit from Newcastle was the best thing. Although it was tough for Newcastle and it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for PSR.",
      "\"But it was the best thing that happened to him, to get out and play. He wasn't going to get in Newcastle's midfield. You've got to give him credit. He wouldn't be far away now [from getting in Newcastle's midfield], I agree with that.",
      "\"He wouldn't have been able to do what he has done and is doing at Newcastle. Good for him. I'm delighted for him. He's gone from being a bit-part player at Newcastle to being one of the main guys at Forest and one of England's.\"",
      "Meanwhile, England boss Thomas Tuchel recently hailed Anderson as one of the most effective midfield players in the Premier League. He said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us.",
      "\"He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though. He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me.\"",

      "Old Trafford chiefs already tested the water for Brighton's £100million-rated Carlos Baleba back in August and the Cameroon international remains on their wish-list. That's alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, who's set to be a key part of England's midfield at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Should United get their way and sign both players, there'll no-doubt be repercussions for those who are already part of Amorim's squad, particularly the midfielders. Amorim has relied on a duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for most of this season, very much a short-term fix.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires in June while Fernandes hasn't ruled out a move away. Therefore, Amorim's midfield could look drastically different this time next year.",
      "Judging by United's plan to sign not one but two midfielders, it'd be a surprise to sign Casemiro to a new contract. The Brazilian is one of their highest earners and 33, his time at Old Trafford is likely coming to an end.",
      "Even if he were to stay by signing a short-term deal, likely on significantly lower wages, Baleba and Anderson would eat up most the minutes and prevent Casemiro from playing as regularly. The former Real Madrid stalwart certainly still has something to offer Amorim but he doesn't fit the profile of player which United are after.",
      "Although Fernandes has hinted that he'll re-evaluate his future after the World Cup, extra options in midfield would allow the United captain to play in a more natural role further forward. Fernandes, 31, is currently being used in a deeper position and isn't able to put up the same volume of of goals and assists that we're used to.",
      "But with Anderson and Baleba behind, he'd have license to play in one of Amorim's two No.10 slots and strut his stuff in the attack. That's if the Portugal star he stays, of course.",
      "Which midfielders should Manchester United sign next summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "On the surface, Mainoo is an obvious loser in this scenario. The 20-year-old is already out of favour under Amorim and wanted to leave on loan before the end of the last summer window.",
      "Mainoo would be pushed further down the pecking order by Anderson and Baleba's arrivals - but could that actually be a good thing for him? Surely then United would sanction his departure and their academy graduate can begin a new chapter away from his boyhood club, where his career has stalled.",
      "Similarly to Fernandes, Mount hasn't been used in his natural position all that often by Amorim. His intelligence and work rate mean that he's a capable midfielder in the Red Devils' system, but the ex-Chelsea man will believe that he can offer a lot more.",
      "With the No.7 on his back, Mount will be hungry for goals and assists in a more attack-minded role at Old Trafford. Being used higher up the pitch - and potentially without Fernandes to compete with - could be what he's been waiting for.",
      "Despite thriving under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, Ugarte hasn't been good enough at United. Still yet to acclimatise to the Premier League, the Uruguayan finds himself struggling for regular game-time like Mainoo.",
      "Like after his move to Paris Saint-Germain, Ugarte hasn't hit the heights expected of him and he'll be a candidate to leave Old Trafford as soon as January. Amorim reportedly slammed the 24-year-old in the wake of last season's Europa League final, criticising his efforts and accusing him of getting comfortable following his big move to Paris in 2023.",
      "How could we forget the manager? It's been reported on multiple occasions that Amorim wants more athleticism in his midfield, hence targeting Anderson and Baleba.",
      "The addition of two Premier League-proven players would be ideal for the Portuguese, whose stuttering rebuild is starting to show signs of life. With Anderson 23 and Baleba 21, Amorim's midfield future-proof and put them on track for long-term success.",
      "Finally, a player who Amorim took a liking to last season. Collyer regularly featured in United's matchday squads and across his 13 appearances, glimpses of the 21-year-old's talent could be seen.",
      "Now on loan at West Brom, Collyer is gaining experience and hopes to return to Old Trafford with a genuine chance of being a starter. But the signings of Anderson and Baleba would change the landscape and he'll face an uphill battle to stake his claim.",

They delivered emphatically with a 9-1 demolition of Armenia in Porto, with Fernandes amongst two players to net a hat-trick on the evening.",
      "This follows worries about the United star's condition during the previous international break, when he picked up a yellow card in the 2-2 stalemate with Hungary and was consequently ruled out of the Ireland defeat through suspension.",
      "At the time, the Portuguese media criticised Fernandes' showing and indicated he displayed signs of \"physical fatigue\", which would certainly have troubled Ruben Amorim and United's backroom team.",
      "Sharpness and fitness will prove vital heading into the winter schedule after the international break, and it could be suggested that Fernandes has satisfied both requirements during his time with Portugal since club football was temporarily halted. While it may not have been ideal for his national side, the fact that United's skipper didn't feature in the loss to Ireland means he's had less game time on his legs.",
      "Considering the concerns over physical exhaustion just a month ago in Portugal, a night off will have done wonders for the United midfielder.",
      "Fernandes' form is another positive, as he put on a top-notch performance during Sunday's match against Armenia.",
      "The Portuguese team secured their spot at next summer's World Cup with an all-round five-star display, but Fernandes' hat-trick will have boosted his confidence no end.",
      "Two of his goals came from penalties - one in each half - while his second goal was scored from open play, thanks to a well-timed pass from Goncalo Ramos that split the Armenian defence.",
      "Fernandes will now head back to Carrington, ready for a crucial series of matches that United should be able to win.",
      "Their first game back is against Everton on Monday Night Football, followed by clashes with Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in the lead up to Christmas.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as a potential January signing, in a deal that would be worth £60million less than Carlos Baleba. The Red Devils have been mooted with a possible move for the Brighton & Hove Albion star but reports suggest that they would want around £104million (€120m) for the Cameroon international.",
      "According to media outlet Record in Portugal, Gomes would be open to leaving the Premier League strugglers to join United and has had a £44million price tag slapped on his head ahead of the winter window.",
      "Wolves ' precarious position in England's top-flight has been suggested as a potential bargaining tool for the former Flamengo midfielder as Daily Mail reports that United were priced out of moves for Baleba and Conor Gallagher during the summer transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim enjoyed a summer splurge as he added much-needed reinforcements into his side, in the form of Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Their spending tipped £230million after the additions, but so far, they have reaped the rewards after looking for a response following their worst top-flight performances in decades. United finished 14th last term and missed out on European qualification, via the trap door, after losing in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "After adding quality in attack and between the sticks, it has been widely dubbed that the midfield will be their next focus as Casemiro reaches the twilight of his football career, turning 34 in February. Several players are said to be on United's wishlist, however, Gomes offers them a much cheaper option and could be available as early as January.",
      "The Mail also adds that England starlets Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are on the radar, with both midfielders enjoying superb campaigns for Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, respectively, though they could cost close to £100m and any deal would likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Their performances in the Premier League have led to the pair being in high demand, and the calls for the duo to be on the plane for this summer's World Cup will likely inflate their already lofty price tags.",
      "ESPN, meanwhile, has previously reported that both Manchester clubs are keen on Baleba. It was said that Pep Guardiola is a long-time admirer of the midfielder, with both clubs set to battle it out for his signature.",
      "In the summer, it was suggested that Brighton would demand £104million for his services, but after staying put at the AMEX Stadium, it remains to be seen what the figures will be with the midfielder in high demand.",
      "Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has admitted that this season, his form has been impacted by a summer of transfer speculation.",
      "He said last month: \"I think it's normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,' he said. 'It's not easy for this player to handle it.",
      "\"Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he's a young player and I think that's something we have to accept, that young players don't always have the face we want to see.\"",

      "Former Manchester United flop Antony has been likened to Cristiano Ronaldo by one of his Real Betis teammates after kickstarting his career away from the Premier League.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined the Spanish side on a permanent deal this summer following a standout spell on loan after United decided to cash-in on the former Ajax man for £22million - losing a huge amount on the £88m sum they parted with to sign him. Antony scored just 12 goals in 96 appearances at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite that, he has managed to get his career back on track in Seville, so much to the extent that Real Betis defender Marc Bartra has compared the winger to icons such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar.",
      "Speaking to Mundobetis, Bartra said: “It’s a style of football that suits him very well, that’s why we’re seeing the real Antony again, even an improved Antony. The first day I spoke with him, I already saw his mentality, with that quality and that Brazilian talent.",
      "“I always say he’s a mix between Neymar and Cristiano. He has the same mentality as Cristiano, always striving for more and being very focused on the game.”",
      "Antony has recently spoken out on his time with Man United and accused the Red Devils of a ‘lack of respect'. As quoted by ESPN Brasil, he said: \"Look, I'm not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won't mention anyone's name here.",
      "\"But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a good morning, a good afternoon.",
      "\"Not even that. But, anyway, that's in the past, I won't give much importance to these things. Now I'm here, at Betis, I'm living here, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Asked why he struggled with United, Antony added: \"I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance. I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing.",
      "\"I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things, going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",
      "Antony, 25, has made 37 appearances for Betis since joining the Spanish side and scored 15 goals - more than he managed in his entire time with United.",

      "Conor Gallagher admits he's \"not satisfied\" with his situation at Atletico Madrid as his minutes remain limited and a return to England - possibly with Manchester United - continues to be talked up.",
      "The midfielder headed to the Spanish capital last summer when he left boyhood club Chelsea and was initially a big hit playing under Diego Simeone. His status as a regular has declined this term, though, and he's spent long periods on the bench, fuelling speculation that he could soon be heading back to the Premier League.",
      "Those in Manchester are actively looking to add a central midfielder, sooner rather than later. The ex-Blues skipper has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford whilst they also consider a number of other possible options.",
      "Gallagher's situation could play in their favour if they do choose to pursue a move for him. He would tick the homegrown quota box and would relish more minutes - but the 25-year-old has not expressed a desire to push for the exit door despite his lack of involvement.",
      "He told Diario AS: “I’m not satisfied. I don’t think anyone will be if they don’t play as much as they would like, but I will continue to work very hard to, whenever I have the opportunity, help the team and hopefully more opportunities will come to be a starter.",
      "“I’m very happy here. My goal is to win titles with Atleti and I want to have a bigger role in the team. And, as I said, I’m going to continue working to the maximum to play more minutes and be able to help the team.”",
      "Atletico have previously seen English imports head home after a period. Kieran Trippier, who joined from Tottenham, later headed back to join Newcastle. Gallagher does enjoy the benefit of Champions League football with the La Liga outfit, who are only six points off top spot having lost just once all year.",
      "Gallagher knows that regular minutes are necessary if he is to convince England boss Thomas Tuchel that he should go to the World Cup this coming summer. The Atletico star has been part of major tournaments in the past and knows what is required if he is to grab the attention of the Three Lions coach.",
      "“That’s one of my goals,\" he said. \"I have spoken to Thomas Tuchel and he has told me what he needs from me and what I have to do to return to the team. And it seems that, right now, it’s very difficult for me to get to that point. But, as I said before, I will continue to do my best to get more minutes and, hopefully, return to the national team.”",

      "Despite their best efforts to turn a corner, Manchester United are still struggling to find their footing this season. Following their worst season in recent memory, the Red Devils splashed out over £200million in the summer on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in an attempt to bolster Ruben Amorim's forward line.",
      "But despite addressing one major problem, another long-term issue has once again raised its head this campaign. United continue to be plagued by an imbalanced midfield that is frequently overrun by lesser teams.",
      "As previously reported, club bosses and Amorim are acutely aware of the need for investment in central midfield. And as part of their long-term rebuilding strategy, the Red Devils are set to prioritise two signings in next summer's transfer window.",
      "One name that keeps cropping up is Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer following an enquiry, but Brighton ultimately dismissed United's interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "It is understood that Amorim's interest in the Cameroon international, Baleba, remains high, despite Brighton's hefty asking price of around £100m. That can be deemed a price worth paying.",
      "Another starlet on United's radar is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who carries a similar price tag of between £100m-£120m. The versatile midfielder, capable of playing both as a No.6 and as a roaming midfielder, has attracted significant attention following his standout performances for Forest and the England national team.",
      "Anderson, one of English football's brightest prospects, is already on Amorim's watchlist. The Portuguese manager previously praised the England star ahead of their match against Forest this season, labelling him a \"very good player\". It appears that admiration has now turned into genuine interest.",
      "Sky Germany reports the 23-year-old doesn't have a release clause, putting Forest in a strong bargaining position. However, it's believed that the Red Devils are prepared to go all out to secure his services.",
      "Signing both players for a combined fee of £200m might raise a few eyebrows, but it's certainly a necessary investment. They would form the midfield backbone for the team for years to come, providing Amorim with much more stability and balance in the centre of the pitch than his current options.",
      "The Portuguese boss has been forced to deploy Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role this season within his 3-4-2-1 system, partnering him with either the ageing Casemiro or underwhelming Manuel Ugarte. In that position, the United captain’s defensive discipline and focus have occasionally been found wanting, with opposition sides capitalising to damaging effect.",
      "Bringing in Baleba and Anderson would enable Fernandes to move back into his favoured role as one of the attacking playmakers operating behind the striker, sharing his game time with players such as Cunha. At 31, the Portugal international has likely already delivered his best performances in a United shirt, and managing his minutes more carefully could benefit both player and club moving forward.",
      "There's also the possibility of selling the playmaker, who nearly moved to Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal during the summer transfer window before rejecting their lucrative offer. If they return with a bid in the region of £70m, United might be wise to accept such a lofty fee to finance their double midfield swoop.",
      "Looking beyond their midfield concerns, United could also set their sights on Crystal Palace right wing-back Daniel Munoz. The Colombian has impressed at Selhurst Park since arriving from Belgian outfit Genk in 2024, and recently confessed it would be a \"dream\" to don the famous red Devils shirt.",
      "While Munoz is under contract at Palace until 2028, he appears to be thinking about the next stage of his career. However, he admitted he has no “concrete information” that United, or his other dream destinations - Barcelona, PSG and Real Madrid - have any real interest in signing him.",
      "His qualities would certainly make him a valuable addition to Amorim’s squad. The 29-year-old has played 81 appearances for the Eagles, scoring eight times. His tireless work-rate and attacking prowess also helped the club lift the FA Cup and Community Shield, and he would be a worthy successor to Diogo Dalot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Kasra joined the Daily Star sports desk in 2021 before becoming a senior sports writer for Reach's new Sports Hub. He specialises in covering Arsenal with exclusive features and opinion pieces, and is fan of the NBA, F1 and boxing.",

      "Speaking to Italian publication Corriere dello Sport, Petrucci stated: \"It's a new league that will be good for the system, bringing resources and entertainment. The agreement also notes that registered clubs must participate in their respective domestic leagues.\"",

      "And we all know the more general maxim about lies and damned lies. But it is the international break, so for the Premier League obsessive, there has been plenty of time to look at facts and figures from the opening 11 games if you are interested in that sort of stuff.",
      "And if you had a lot of time to fill, you might even have looked at the tables at this stage of every season in Premier League history. Here is what you would have found.",
      "In 16 of the 33 seasons, the team that has led after 11 fixtures has gone on to win the title. That means that on 17 occasions, a team that has been top of the table after 11 games has NOT gone on to become Premier League champions.",
      "And the team responsible for FIVE of those instances was Arsenal. The last side not to win the Premier League after being top at the 11-game mark was Arsenal.",
      "At this stage in 2022/23, the Gunners held a four-point lead over Manchester City, who would go on to become champions. The Gunners currently hold a four-point lead over Manchester City.",
      "As my mate implied, these statistics should have zero influence over the destiny of this season’s title. But what they do show is that leading the table after 11 games does not make overall success anything close to a formality.",
      "And one mildly interesting aspect to these statistics is the gap that has been bridged by teams who have trailed at this stage but have gone on to win the title. In terms of points, the furthest any eventual champion has been from the top at this stage of the season is eight. And that has only happened twice.",
      "But it can happen, which is why the five teams currently on 18 points cannot be ruled out of the title race. Which is why Manchester United cannot be ruled out of the title race.",
      "Yes, United play Wolves twice in three December weeks. Happy Christmas. Of their next five away trips, only one is of any serious distance.",
      "But that road trip to Crystal Palace is followed by visits to Wolves, Aston Villa, Leeds and Burnley. There will not be many festive hours on the road for Amorim and his men.",
      "Numerically, the fixture list only gives United an advantage over those who have European and EFL Cup commitments. And most of those appear to boast stronger squads than the one Amorim has. But the impact made by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, not to mention the steadying effect of keeper Senne Lammens, has been significant.",
      "In the last two games of their unbeaten five-match run - 2-2 draws at Spurs and Nottingham Forest - United have hardly been electric, but they now look like a team that believes in the manager’s system and that, most crucially, believes it is going to win matches. And that is a good portion of the battle.",
      "With the bookmakers, United are between 33-1 and 50-1 to win the title and there is a reason bookies are very rich. They don’t get much wrong.",
      "But of those two teams who have indeed overcome an eight-point deficit after 11 games and gone on to be crowned Premier League champions, the most recent did it in the 2002/23 season. Manchester United. If only for the coincidence punter, Amorim’s side might be worth a bet.",

That condemned Hungary to a third-place finish in their group and saw them stripped of a potential place at the World Cup. It also means that Liverpool pair Dominik Szoboszlai and Milos Kerkez will not be at the tournament.",
      "After being absent from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Nigeria will now miss a second consecutive tournament. They got as far as the final of the play-off tournament and took on DR Congo.",

      "Manchester United may be homing in a potential solution to one positional conundrum that's been plaguing the squad for some time now. That's after the player in question admitted it would be a \"dream\" to join the Red Devils one day.",
      "Ruben Amorim is coming off the back of a transfer window that has had a very positive impact at United. So much so that Sir Alex Ferguson has come out voicing his approval for one signing in particular.",
      "Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz has put his hand up as a potential future signing for Amorim after saying it would be a \"dream come true\" to play for United. The Colombian is enjoying a superb sophomore season at Selhurst Park but recently included the Red Devils among his list of ideal transfer destinations.",
      "\"First of all, I think there’s a lot of talk about one club or another,\" he told AS. \"If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it’s Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.\"",
      "There can be no more certain a gesture that a player would be receptive to a transfer inquiry. And given United's issues filling the right wing-back slot as Amorim's system demands, Munoz could be an ideal addition.",
      "Amad Diallo is currently occupying the role, while Noussair Mazraoui and Digo Dalot have offered support there when fit. Even prior to Amorim's arrival, there was debate as to whether the right side of the defence had the talent required.",
      "Though on the older side of United's usual transfer policy, that would in theory reduce the fee Palace might expect for Munoz. And after excelling under Oliver Glasner, the former Genk talisman could be an understated answer to one of the Red Devils' long-term dilemmas.",
      "\"I think I’m working towards that,\" added Munoz before hinting he'd be open to a mid-season switch. \"I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it’s a dream of mine to get there.",
      "\"Right now I’m focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. If you ask me, I don’t have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me.",
      "\"My focus is on Crystal Palace; we’ll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I’m fully focused on these two matches with the national team.\"",
      "Amid the swell of fresh faces that arrived at Old Trafford over the summer, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha stick out as some of the more impressive. The pair formed part of a £200million attacking makeover alongside Benjamin Sesko, and fans have been largely impressed by their impact to date.",
      "However, Ferguson's attention was more focused on the opposite end of the field after addressing the new arrival that has left the biggest mark. And the United great has been thrilled by the upgrade effect Senne Lammens has had between the posts.",
      "\"There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,\" he told Raceday RTV. \"Particularly the goalkeeper has been outstanding, he’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "\"Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, they’ve added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - the signs are getting better.",
      "\"I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where the improvement has to come by waiting and being patient, they’ll enjoy it now.\"",

      "Ex-Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck has been tipped as the ideal mentor for new signing Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils splashed out on their attack during the summer transfer window, bringing in Premier League-tested talents Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They also made a significant investment in the European market by snapping up former RB Leipzig forward Sesko, beating off competition from Newcastle United. So far this season, the Slovenian international has netted two goals and provided one assist in his 12 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, Sesko hit a bump in the road in his last match before the international break - a 2-2 stalemate away at Tottenham - where he was brought on as a second-half substitute only to be quickly taken off due to a suspected knee injury. Consequently, the 22-year-old did not join his national team and has spent the break working towards regaining his fitness.",
      "Reports this week suggest the striker is still a few weeks away from making a comeback, meaning he's likely to sit out several crucial matches after the international break. As the January transfer window looms, rumours about potential new arrivals are naturally gaining momentum.",
      "One name that has been loosely associated with a move to Old Trafford is ex-striker Welbeck, and pundit Don Hutchison reckons the Brighton forward would be the perfect guide for Sesko as he adjusts to the English top tier.",
      "\"I mean, it'd be a brilliant fit,\" Hutchison said in an interview with SportCasting. \"He'd be a fantastic signing because Danny Welbeck's one of those players where, if he went back to Man United, it would be like when Jonny Evans returned.",
      "\"When Jonny Evans went back there a couple of years ago, he was happy to be a sort of mentor inside the dressing room. He was happy to be a mentor to the players that were playing. He was happy to play his part when needed. He was happy to be on the bench.",
      "\"I think Danny Welbeck going to Man United would be a really good fit in terms of he can still play, he can still score goals, he's still really fit. But he would still have the attitude where it would be a fantastic move forward, being back at Man United with the knowledge that he'd be mentoring the likes of Sesko. I think it would be a perfect move.\"",
      "Welbeck progressed through United's academy system and clocked up more than 140 first-team outings before his switch to Arsenal in 2014.",
      "He subsequently had a stint at Watford prior to his Brighton move in 2020, where he's experienced a career revival - especially this campaign, netting six times in 11 Premier League matches to date.",
      "This wouldn't be the first occasion the 34-year-old has been touted for a stunning Old Trafford comeback, with speculation also surfacing around this period last year.",
      "However, at present, there's no solid evidence suggesting United are plotting a swoop for the striker.",

      "Chelsea summer signing Alejandro Garnacho has barely had time to settle in before rumours have started swirling that his position could be under threat. And the potential competition is none other than Marcus Rashford.",
      "Both players experienced their own forms of exile at Manchester United last season before departing Old Trafford in the summer. Garnacho, 21, completed a bargain £40million move to Stamford Bridge, while 28-year-old Rashford was loaned out to Barcelona.",
      "Garnacho has been in the starting line-up for Chelsea's last five Premier League matches and assisted two of their three goals in a victory over Wolves just prior to the international break. However, if Rashford were to join the Blues, Garnacho's spot would immediately be up for grabs.",
      "This scenario is becoming increasingly likely as Rashford's brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, is reported to have held talks with Chelsea. El Nacional claims Rashford's representative was in London for negotiations, while Tottenham are also said to be in discussions.",
      "Barcelona hold first-refusal rights on Rashford and can sign him permanently next summer for a fee of around £28m. The player has seen a revival in Spain and appears to be worth the price tag after contributing 15 direct goal contributions (six goals, nine assists) in only 16 appearances under Hansi Flick.",
      "The England forward is on track to hit double figures for the first time since his 30-goal haul under Erik ten Hag in the 2022/23 season. However, United might be hoping Barca don't make his signing permanent, knowing they could command a higher fee in today's market.",
      "Rumours are swirling that Rashford has had enough of life at United, particularly with the prospect of playing under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Yet, a return to Premier League action isn't out of the question if Chelsea decide to pursue their interest.",
      "Garnacho used the tension between Rashford and United to engineer his own departure from the club earlier this year. The Argentine star posted a photo of himself donning Rashford's Aston Villa shirt in June, just as Rashford was wrapping up a six-month loan spell in Birmingham.",
      "This not-so-subtle hint caused an uproar among many United supporters and was seen as a clear signal he wanted out of United. Garnacho got his wish, but it's somewhat ironic Rashford could now disrupt his rise in west London.",
      "Enzo Maresca seems to be a big admirer of Garnacho's talent and has given him more responsibility in the starting line-up recently. Cole Palmer's recent injury problems have worked in his favour, although he could find himself back on the bench once the Englishman is fit again.",
      "Rashford's impressive form at Barcelona hasn't gone unnoticed by England boss Thomas Tuchel, who brought the forward back into the starting line-up for the recent 2-0 victory over Serbia. Meanwhile, Garnacho has been overlooked by Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni and is one year removed from his last international appearance.",
      "While United would ideally want to get the highest possible price for Rashford if he were to leave, selling to a direct competitor comes with its own risks. And this could be one reunion that Garnacho might prefer to avoid if it were to jeopardise his position at Chelsea.",

      "Rashford entered the United academy at merely seven years old. A native of the city, he is a genuine Mancunian and swiftly became a supporters' favourite at Old Trafford as he progressed into the senior side. He rapidly became not just one of the most prominent figures in Manchester, but a significant presence on the world stage.",
      "His disagreement with Amorim was extensively reported, and his loan period at Aston Villa indicated a desire to distance himself from the club where he developed.",

      "Former Premier League star Kieron Dyer has revealed how he agreed to \"kick up some noise\" at Newcastle United in his bid to secure a move to Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Dyer was at his brilliant best at St. James' Park when Ferguson came calling - quite literally.",
      "The Old Trafford legend was one of numerous bosses who tried to sign Dyer during his early days playing in England's top flight. The ex-midfielder narrowly missed out on Premier League promotion with Ipswich Town in 1999 when a host of top clubs were chasing his signature.",
      "Dyer was quizzed about which sides were keen to snap him up from Ipswich and told the Open Goal podcast: \"Juventus, I know Arsenal, I know Newcastle because Ruud Gullit rung me, I know Leeds because David O'Leary rung me, I know West Ham because Harry Redknapp rung me all when I'm in Ayia Napa, steaming, so I'm thinking, 'What a time to ring!'",
      "\"Everyone talks about your journey but what is so great is taking your friends on the journey with you. Can you imagine, I've got Ruud Gullit on the phone [in front of my friends] and I'm going, 'it's Ruud!'\"",
      "Regarding Ferguson's pursuit of the player, Dyer disclosed just how far the Scot went to test his ambition for the move. And Dyer, who was already at Newcastle by then, was so excited by the prospect that he agreed to help his suitors if it meant joining forces at Old Trafford.",
      "\"There was a time with Man United when I was at Newcastle and my agent rings me and goes, 'I'm now putting you on speaker phone,'\" he continued. \"I'm at the airport at New York me and Titus [Bramble] are coming back to England.",
      "\"[My agent] says, 'You're now going to hear a few voices', the first voice was Pini Zahavi who was the 'super agent', he was Rio [Ferdinand's] agent then the next voice was, 'Hi Kieron, it's Sir Alex,' so I'm like [gestures mouthing Sir Alex Ferguson while pointing at the phone].",
      "\"He said, 'I just want you to answer me two questions, first is do you want to come and play for Manchester United?' I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
      "\"The second was, 'If [Newcastle] don't accept the bid will you go and kick up some noise?' Then I was like, 'Yeah, yeah,' and that was it, he just hung up the phone.\"",
      "Hardly the kind of encouraging reaction Dyer might have anticipated after confirming he'd commit one of football's most heinous crimes. Yet the gaffer may well have been cautious about appearing overly committed by offering a glowing endorsement of Dyer's willingness.",
      "Ultimately, the transfer fell through. United tabled a £15million offer for Dyer but saw their approach knocked back when they were unwilling to match Newcastle's reported £25m asking price. He racked up 250 appearances for the Magpies, even earning a spot in the Premier League Team of the Year after the 2002/03 campaign.",
      "Dyer later donned the jerseys of QPR and Middlesbrough before hanging up his boots at the Riverside in 2013. With no major silverware to his name from his playing career, he might wonder whether things would have been different had he secured that move to United all those years ago.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee won't be counting down the days until Christmas this year.",
      "They will be counting down the days until the January transfer window opens. The pair have hardly played for Manchester United this season, and the winter window could offer an escape route.",
      "Mainoo has played 228 minutes in all competitions and has started just once in the Carabao Cup. Zirkzee has not been given a single start and has played just 90 minutes in five substitute appearances.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he understood why Mainoo and Zirkzee would be frustrated, especially in a World Cup season, and he responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So I understand that, but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "He said during a separate interview: \"I see Kobbie Mainoo training today, and he deserves to play, but then I have to take one guy [out] that's playing really well. We should have played in the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"Because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing, I need to see Josh, all of these guys deserve to play, but in the end, it is one more game you need to make choices. So you have both sides.\"",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe and the defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round mean there are fewer fixtures to rotate the team, but Amorim has chosen to overlook Mainoo and Zirkzee.",
      "It's not been a surprise to see the latter fall out of favour. Zirkzee was signed as a striker, but he couldn't lead the attack and was eventually relocated to one of the No.10 roles last season.",
      "He looked more comfortable in that role and delivered some decent performances, however, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed for those positions in the summer.",
      "Mason Mount is next in the pecking order, while Amad can also play in that role, so Zirkzee hasn't had a sniff and will likely want to leave in January for the sake of regular game time.",
      "Mainoo's situation feels different. The youngster was outstanding during his breakout campaign, he scored the matchwinner in the 2024 FA Cup final and starred for England at Euro 2024.",
      "He has fallen from a higher starting point than Zirkzee. Mainoo has reacted in the right way, getting his head down and working hard, but Amorim has said the 20-year-old is competing with Bruno Fernandes to start.",
      "Mainoo has done everything he can to change Amorim's mind, even changing his private chef at home in an attempt to improve his game and working with private coaches during the international breaks.",
      "His request to leave on loan was blocked in the final days of the summer transfer window, and it seems inevitable the question will be asked again in the winter window.",
      "It was not long ago that he was starting for England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final, but his dream of representing his country at the World Cup next summer has looked less likely each week this term.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has explained that he needs minutes to feature in his plans. The only way Mainoo will give himself a chance of going to the World Cup is by leaving United on loan in January.",
      "Whether United permit an exit for either Zirkzee or Mainoo remains to be seen. They are seen as important squad players and United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Zirkzee and Mainoo will argue their case and want to play in the second half of the season to give themselves a chance of going to the World Cup, but United will argue they are needed in Manchester.",
      "While their situations are unfortunate, United pay their wages and will put the club first.",

      "Manchester United let down their fanbase last season with poor performances across all competitions.",
      "The Europa League was nearly the saving grace but when push came to shove, the Reds were not the team they needed to be. United were so far away from the levels expected of them that it was hard to see a quick recovery.",
      "And yet here we are in mid-November with United a point off the top-four and five games unbeaten. They are not the finished article but there are clear signs that United are becoming a team who can challenge at the right end of the Premier League.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, psychology expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, Dr Martin Turner, believes the turnaround could lie in the mentality of the squad this season.",
      "Dr Turner, who has worked alongside The FA and Scarlets Rugby, said: \"It is so important when we talk about experienced players, it is not just because they have kicked a ball more times than the player next to them, but they have gone through the peaks and troughs of football. They have been under pressure, they have succeeded, they have failed, and they have become psychologically robust to the different ups and downs of the sport.",
      "\"That is part of the reason why experience really counts because through facing difficulty you grow and develop and learn to be a bit more robust. So it is partly about time, particularly with Manchester United and the amount of change that has taken place over a short period of time, which we know can be stressful and taxing, [but] over time those players will start to acclimatise to that and become more robust.\"",
      "When asked if the recruitment of players like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who have proven Premier League quality, while keeping players who experienced the lows of last season and overcome them, is leading to improved performances this season, Dr Turner replied: \"Yes, exactly they are just able to weather those storms a little better.",
      "\"They have less psychological peaks and troughs. After a good game, they will feel pretty good but they won’t get carried away with it and after a bad game, they would feel pretty bad but it wouldn’t be the end of the world for them. They learn to take success and failure in their stride because they have succeeded and failed so often.",
      "\"When you look at the world’s best performers, it is not just that they succeed all the time, they are able to recognise that when they do fail, it is a temporary thing and they know that they will come back and bounce back. That is hard for a less experienced player to realise because they haven’t had the psychological experience of those successes and failures. Sometimes it takes failure at the biggest stage to do some of that too.\"",
      "Next Monday, United return to the Premier League when they host Everton at Old Trafford. Should they avoid defeat, they will be six games unbeaten. However, the lingering worry for United is that tiredness could start to creep in despite playing fewer matches this season.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt spoke after the Tottenham game about the team feeling tired in the second half of matches and Dr Turner believes that the mental challenges of competing in the Premier League are contributing to that.",
      "\"The brain is using largely the same energy system as the body, people forget that the brain is in the body,\" he said.",
      "\"It feels like it is this separate thing because we talk about mind and body but they are obviously part of the same body so they are using the same energy. We know that it is actually quite difficult for people in high pressured situations, tough jobs, like being an athlete, and that can be exhausting.",
      "\"Not just the physical stuff but dealing with the emotions every day, dealing with expectation, dealing with the social aspect of being involved in sport at a high level, it can actually make you mentally exhausted and it can have an impact on your physical exhaustion because the energy is coming from the same space. So it is about developing this resistance and robustness over time to these kinds of things which is where experienced players come in.\"",

      "When England faced the Netherlands for a place in the European Championship finals 18 months ago, two Manchester United stars were dreaming of international glory. Now they’re facing a transfer conundrum to try and save their World Cup dream.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirzkee are both in the international wilderness just now with game time for Manchester United in short supply.",
      "Mainoo was something of a breakout star for England in their run to the final of Euro 2024 and seemed to have a central midfield position under lock and key for years to come for club and country. Under two years later and the 20-year-old has fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and will need a January move and a stunning run of form to offer any hope of a late run into Thomas Tuchel’s England thinking.",
      "Mainoo’s stuttering career is puzzling to plenty and while Amorim has offered words of encouragement, they haven’t translated into meaningful minutes.",
      "And even though he is on the fringes of things at Old Trafford, United are unlikely to sanction a temporary move away for the youngster given he is a regular in matchday squads.",
      "It’s a similar story for Zirkzee, who came off the bench for the Netherlands against England in that semi-final but can’t get off it for United this season.",
      "He’s been used sparingly by Amorim and even the injury to sole centre forward Benjamin Sesko doesn’t look like yielding many minutes for the Dutchman.",
      "He has been left out of the recent international squads and with Ronald Koeman’s side all but assured a place in the World Cup, Zirkzee must surely move if he is to join his countrymen in North America.",
      "But again United are not certain to offload the 24-year-old particularly given Sesko’s injury, even if Amorim suggested the club might look to add an attacking option in January.",
      "Zirkzee and Mainoo are set to remain on the outside looking in, just as they will be in the summer come the World Cup.",

      "Just 44 goals. That is the measly sum Manchester United managed to conjure up last season in the Premier League.",
      "To put that into perspective, only the bottom three and Everton scored fewer goals in the top flight. No wonder United were left hovering above the relegation zone.",
      "It was United's major failing and while the argument can be made that the league was sacrificed towards the end of the campaign for the Europa League, goals were an issue when the Reds were taking it seriously. On just 12 occasions out of 38 Premier League matches last season did United score twice or more in a single game.",
      "This includes the times when even that was not enough to secure the three points - like against Brentford and Everton away where the Reds. Compare that to this season, and already the figures are looking brighter.",
      "Only 11 Premier League matches in and United have scored two or more goals in seven games and they have not yet lost after scoring on multiple occasions in a single match. So what could be behind this up turn in form?",
      "Well, the inclusion of Bryan Mbeumo into the starting XI has helped but there is also a secret weapon starting to take pressure off the forward line. His name is Casemiro.",
      "The Brazilian is not known for his goalscoring pedigree. As a defensive midfielder, he hasn't been expected to chip in with goals and his best goalscoring seasons were when he bagged seven in 2020/21 for Real Madrid and matched that tally in his debut campaign with United.",
      "Yet this campaign has seen him score three goals already, easily swamping his record in the 2024/25 Premier League. He scored five in the entirety of last season which included a brace against a hapless Leicester City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Casemiro currently finds himself as United's second top scorer at the club and this could be because of a change in style that we are seeing Ruben Amorim and the rest of the Premier League employ. MEN Sport have spoken previously about the danger the midfielder poses from set pieces.",
      "Apart from his goal against Brighton, which even he will admit was fortuitous, Casemiro has scored either directly or indirectly from a set piece. Against Chelsea, the goal came as the away side failed to deal with a short corner routine which the Brazilian eventually nodded in.",
      "At Nottingham Forest, he headed home from a corner and during this weekend's international friendly against Senegal at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, he showed great composure from a Rodrygo free kick to add another goal. Casemiro is quickly becoming a danger man from dead ball scenarios for both club and country and that can only be a good thing for United.",
      "Lots could be made of Rasmus Hojlund's lack of goals last season, but it should not be solely down to the centre-forward to be scoring. Goals need to be coming from all over the park and that is what Casemiro is starting to do.",
      "United are no longer so one-dimensional in their attack. Just ten different players scored in the Premier League for the Reds last season, now there is already nine different goalscorers.",
      "Casemiro is the secret weapon though, leading the way for others to chip in with goals in the Premier League this season.",

      "Hello and welcome to today's live Manchester United blog, keeping you on top of the latest transfer news and rumours from Old Trafford.",
      "It's not too long now until the January transfer window opens and there continues to be talk of potential imcomings and outgoings as plans for the window are put into place.",
      "One player who has been linked with a move away from United is midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. The academy graduate has struggled for game time this season and Napoli are the team said to be showing the most interest in a potential deal.",
      "It's in the middle where Ruben Amorim is most likely to strengthen in the next couple of transfer windows. Several names have been linked including Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba.",
      "But it's not only in central midfield where United could strengthen as Amorim may look at other areas too. Another player to be linked over the last few days include Borussia Dortmund winger Karim Adeyemi.",
      "With the return of the Premier League on the horizon, Amorim will be preparing his team for the home clash against Everton which takes place in one week. Ahead of that game, United sit in seventh place in the table, but are just one point from the top four.",
      "Follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "Thanks for tuning into our Manchester United transfer blog. Our live coverage has now come to a close, but you can continue to keep up with all of the latest news and headlines on the Reds on our homepage here.",
      "We will see you bright and early tomorrow!",
      "Manchester United's struggle for goals last season saw them turn to the perilous field of the January transfer market. Their two senior striker options, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, had mustered just five league goals between them as the final knockings of the mid-season window approached.",
      "Mathys Tel and Christopher Nkunku were considered as emergency options to sharpen one of the league's bluntest attacks, but ultimately United stuck with the misfiring Hojlund and Zirkzee. Two league goals for Hojlund in the second half of the campaign and none for Zirkzee, alongside an abysmal 15th-placed finish and no silverware added to the cabinet, would suggest United were wrong not to sign a striker in January.",
      "But the truth is neither Tel nor Nkunku were the answer. Tel bagged a January loan move to Spurs and notched just two league goals. He would go on to secure a permanent £30million move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and his haul of four league goals for the club in nearly a year is hardly eye-watering stuff - albeit one of those strikes did deny United a win at Spurs earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, Nkunku scored just one Premier League goal in the second half of the 2024/25 season before swapping Chelsea for AC Milan in a £36m deal in the summer. His Serie A tally for the Italian giants currently stands at zero.",
      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches. United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago. Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight. As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "Roy Keane has praised Adam Wharton after it was reported that Manchester United are lining up a £60million bid. Crystal Palace youngster Wharton was given his first start for England by Thomas Tuchel on Sunday, helping the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 away from home.",
      "Wharton, 21, created the most chances (three) before being subbed off in the 75th minute while on a yellow card. At half-time in the World Cup qualifier, Keane was asked to give his verdict on the midfielder, who the Daily Star recently claimed is set to be the subject of a £60m bid from United.",
      "Manchester United fans will have eagerly taken in Casemiro's latest Brazil masterclass as the midfielder looks to tie down his spot in Carlo Ancelotti's plans. And the midfield maestro turned the clock back as he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "He and Chelsea winger Estevao each contributed as the Selecao continue to make progress under former Real Madrid chief Ancelotti. And the response from Brazilian media suggests United star Casemiro will indeed have an important role to play at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The major question for United fans is whether that will be as a United player, with Casemiro's contract due to expire next summer. The club hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension to his stay, and Casemiro has been making a strong case despite his eye-watering £350,000-a-week salary.",
      "News outlets in his home country have nevertheless been raving following his impressive performances for his national team this season, with his latest display showing he \"has evolved\" at a late stage in his career while also becoming his side's \"main leader\" ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "Manchester United will find it difficult not to look on enviously at Barcelona this season considering how well Marcus Rashford has done for them. The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford.",
      "His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave. Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "An update has emerged on Benjamin Sesko's injury after the striker handed Manchester United a scare earlier this month. The Slovenia international picked up a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break.",
      "Sesko was only substituted into the game in the 59th minute, but the striker was unable to finish the game due to an injury. There were initial fears that Sesko could be on the sidelines for a significant length of time, although there have since been suggestions that the injury was not as serious as first feared.",
      "A reported Manchester United transfer target has been fined £396,000 after admitting to possession of a pair of brass knuckles and a taser. The case against Borussia Dortmund and Germany star Karim Adeyemi was concluded by a district court in Hagen, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.",
      "According to The Athletic, the possession case dates back to 2024. Adeyemi has avoided a public trial and will not be given a criminal record. Instead, he must pay a fine that has been calculated at 60 daily rates of £6,600 (€7,500), 'in accordance with his salary and which started on October 30'.",
      "German law prohibits the possession of either item and can carry a sentence of up to three years in prison. In an official statement, Adeyemi's Bundesliga club, Dortmund, said: “BVB always takes criminal allegations seriously and uses them as an opportunity to discuss them with its employees while respecting confidentiality obligations.”",
      "Conor Gallagher has admitted he wants a bigger role at Atletico Madrid after being linked with a move to Manchester United. United’s well known frailties in central midfield have understandably led to the club looking at potential options in the transfer market.",
      "One of the players they were linked with in the summer was the 25-year-old England international, although a move failed to materialise as Atletico were only prepared to sanction a permanent sale.",
      "Gallagher, who was sold by boyhood club Chelsea to the La Liga side in the summer of 2024 for a fee of £34million, made 50 appearances in Spain in his first season. And while he has continued to feature in every game, his minutes have been mainly limited to appearances off the bench.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as a potential January acquisition, in a deal that could save them £60million compared to signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with the Brighton and Hove Albion star, but it's suggested that the Seagulls would demand around £104million (€120m) for the Cameroon international.",
      "Portuguese media outlet Record reports that Gomes is open to a move to Old Trafford and could be signed for just £44m ahead of the January window.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is said to have a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, which could leave Manchester United licking their lips. After finding himself linked with the Reds this summer, Semenyo committed his future to the Cherries.",
      "However, despite signing a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030, he could find himself on the move as early as January due to a breaking new revelation. As per The Athletic, the Ghanaian's new contract holds a £65m release clause, which any club can trigger, meaning that Bournemouth may have to 'accept' that his future is out of their hands.",
      "The report also details how Semenyo was valued at around £70m this summer, with his release clause allowing interested parties to secure his services for marginally cheaper come January. However, it is also claimed that United - or any other suitors for that matter - will have to activate his clause by a certain date to allow the Cherries to find a replacement.",
      "Read the full story from our colleagues at the Mirror, here.",
      "Manchester United striker Joe Hugill has been unavailable for three months on loan at Barnet due to an injury.",
      "Hugill started in Barnet's opening two games of the season against Fleetwood Town and Bromley, but he has been absent since the start of August. Almost every academy player who leaves United on loan has a recall break clause that can be activated after six months, which gives a chance to assess whether it's best for the youngster to stay on loan.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Hugill spends the second half of the season with Barnet. The youngster's contract at Old Trafford expires in June, but United have the option of extending the deal by 12 months.",
      "Just 44 goals. That is the measly sum Manchester United managed to conjure up last season in the Premier League. To put that into perspective, only the bottom three and Everton scored fewer goals in the top flight. No wonder United were left hovering above the relegation zone.",
      "It was United's major failing and while the argument can be made that the league was sacrificed towards the end of the campaign for the Europa League, goals were an issue when the Reds were taking it seriously. On just 12 occasions out of 38 Premier League matches last season did United score twice or more in a single game.",
      "This includes the times when even that was not enough to secure the three points - like against Brentford and Everton away where the Reds. Compare that to this season, and already the figures are looking brighter.",
      "Manchester United let down their fanbase last season with poor performances across all competitions. The Europa League was nearly the saving grace but when push came to shove, the Reds were not the team they needed to be. United were so far away from the levels expected of them that it was hard to see a quick recovery.",
      "And yet here we are in mid-November with United a point off the top-four and five games unbeaten. They are not the finished article but there are clear signs that United are becoming a team who can challenge at the right end of the Premier League.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, psychology expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, Dr Martin Turner, believes the turnaround could lie in the mentality of the squad this season.",
      "Manchester United reportedly turned down the chance of swapping Alejandro Garnacho for Romeo Lavia this summer, despite the Chelsea star previously impressing Pep Guardiola.",
      "Garnacho's future at Old Trafford was cast into speculation at the end of last season, when the forward criticised his club's lacklustre Premier League campaign which saw them finish at a lowly 15th. After a summer of discontent, the 21-year-old snagged a £40million move to Stamford Bridge, while Ruben Amorim welcomed a new front line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to strengthen his attack.",
      "However, as per ESPN, instead of a straight money deal, it is understood that United were offered Chelsea star Lavia as part of the deal for Garnacho, which could have gone a long way in addressing the Reds' midfield woes at present. The club were linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, before his club's £100m price tag eventually proved too rich for United's taste.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee won't be counting down the days until Christmas this year. They will be counting down the days until the January transfer window opens. The pair have hardly played for Manchester United this season, and the winter window could offer an escape route.",
      "Mainoo has played 228 minutes in all competitions and has started just once in the Carabao Cup. Zirkzee has not been given a single start and has played just 90 minutes in five substitute appearances.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he understood why Mainoo and Zirkzee would be frustrated, especially in a World Cup season, and he responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So I understand that, but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as a potential January signing, in a deal that would be worth £60million less than Carlos Baleba. The Red Devils have been mooted with a possible move for the Brighton & Hove Albion star but reports suggest that they would want around £104million (€120m) for the Cameroon international.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United reportedly rejected midfielder Romeo Lavia as part of the deal to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea in the summer.",
      "Reports from ESPN claim that the Blues were willing to hand over Lavia and receive less than the £40m paid for Garnacho. However, United are said to have snubbed the 21-year-old because of worries about his fitness record.",
      "Conor Gallagher admits he is ‘not satisfied’ with his game-time at Atletico Madrid amid speculation linking the former Chelsea midfielder with a move to Manchester United.",
      "\"I’m not satisfied,\" Gallagher told AS. \"I don’t think anyone will be if they don’t play as much as they would like.",
      "\"But I will continue to work very hard to, whenever I have the opportunity, help the team and hopefully more opportunities will come to be a starter.\"",
      "When England faced the Netherlands for a place in the European Championship finals 18 months ago, two Manchester United stars were dreaming of international glory. Now they’re facing a transfer conundrum to try and save their World Cup dream.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirzkee are both in the international wilderness just now with game time for Manchester United in short supply.",
      "Mainoo was something of a breakout star for England in their run to the final of Euro 2024 and seemed to have a central midfield position under lock and key for years to come for club and country.

      "Read the full piece here",
      "Former Premier League striker Alan Shearer has said that Manchester United transfer target Elliot Anderson wouldn't be in the position he is now if he had stayed with Manchester United.",
      "The midfielder joined Nottingham Forest in the summer of 2024, and has since established himself in the England squad and team. The move was brought about by Newcastle needing to sell due to PSR concerns.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Shearer said:",
      "“It was the best thing. Although it was tough for Newcastle and it wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for PSR.",
      "“But it was the best thing that happened to him, to get out and play. He wasn’t going to get in Newcastle’s midfield. You’ve got to give him credit. He wouldn’t be far away now [from getting in Newcastle’s midfield], I agree with that.",
      "\"He wouldn’t have been able to do what he has done and is doing at Newcastle. Good for him. I’m delighted for him. He’s gone from being a bit-part player at Newcastle to being one of the main guys at Forest and one of England’s.”",
      "United striker Joshua Zirkzee has 'made it clear' that he is interested in joining Roma in the January transfer window, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Corriere dello Sport report that Zirkzee is 'top of the list 'when it comes to Roma's search for a striker.",
      "The repor adds that the player himself is open to the move, due to a chance of starying games more reguarly and therefre increasing his chance of making the Netherlands squad for the summer's World Cup.",
      "Manchester United are one of five clubs keeping an eye on the situation over the future of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, according to reports.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport name United alongside Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Barcelona as club 'keeping their eyes peeled'.",
      "The striker is out of contract with Juve next summer, and is yet to agree a new deal. It is said that he will have to take a wage cut of around half if he was to sign a new contract with the Italian giants.",
      "Barcelona have made their feelings clear on Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford.",
      "The forward was sent out to Catalonia on a season-long loan after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds' head coach Ruben Amorim. The La Liga giants have the option to make his move permanent for £28 million in 2026, with reports from Sport suggesting Barca are already working to \"outline an agreement\" with United.",
      "Rashford has impressed so far in Spain with six goals and nine assists across all competitions in a Barcelona shirt. The 28-year-old has the most assists of any player in Europe's top five leagues.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Roma are in talks with United over a deal for Joshua Zirkzee, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport report that talks are underway over a loan deal with an option to buy. It is added that it is hoped that a deal can be done early in the transfer window.",
      "It's reportsd that the buy option in any deal will 'not be less' than €35 million (£30.8m). Roma will reportedly pay half of Zirkzee's wages during the loan spell, although discussions are yet to be finalised.",
      "Mason Greenwood has been named Ligue 1's Player of the Month shortly amid reports linking the 24-year-old with a return to the England national team.",
      "Greenwood won the award for October. The former Manchester United forward scored five goals during the month, with four of those coming in Marseille’s 6-2 victory over Le Havre. He also found the net against Lens in a 2-1 defeat.",
      "The youngster has scored nine times this season and provided four assists in 15 appearances. His numbers last year were impressive too, with Greenwood tying PSG’s Ousmane Dembele for the French Golden Boot with 21 league goals.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Manchester United's official Instagram account have made their feelings on Joshua Zirkzee clear amid links with a move away from the club.",
      "The striker has sturggled to make an impact at Old Trafford since his arrival last summer. He has been linked with a January deal to AS Roma.",
      "Amid the speculation, United have used the player as part of their marketing for the United store.",
      "They have posted a picture of Zirkzee in official merchandise, along with a caption that simpy reads: \"Josh\".",
      "A move for Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba is likely to be reignited next summer, according to journalist Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United were first linked with an interest last summer, with the player said to be keen to make a move.",
      "While the January window is coming up, it's said that a move then is unlikely with eyes instead on summer 2026.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano has said:",

      "Antoine Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, which may reignite Manchester United's interest in the star.",
      "Despite speculation linking the 25-year-old with a move to Old Trafford this summer, Semenyo decided to commit his future to the Cherries. However, regardless of signing a five-year extension, which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030, the star may find himself on the move as soon as January, thanks to a new revelation.",
      "According to The Athletic, the Ghanaian's latest contract contains a £65m release clause, which any club can activate. It's understood that Bournemouth have reluctantly 'accepted' that his destiny is beyond their control, and a January departure could be on the cards.",
      "The report additionally reveals how Semenyo was priced at approximately £70m this summer, with his release clause enabling interested clubs to acquire his services for slightly less come January. It is also suggested that United - or any other potential buyers for that matter - have a deadline to trigger his clause, which would allow the Cherries to locate a replacement.",
      "It follows Semenyo recently rejecting suggestions that he was eager to leave his present club. When questioned by Jamie Redknapp about his future recently, the forward replied: \"I don't think about it too much.",
      "\"I try to stay present as much as I can. You see the news all the time, I see it as well, I'm not oblivious, but I try to keep focused. I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.",
      "\"When they [his former team-mates] all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year.",
      "\"How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well. I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment,\" reports the Mirror.",
      "Following an eye-catching return of 13 goals in all competitions last season, Semenyo became the subject of transfer talk linking him with moves to United, Liverpool and Tottenham, among others. Ultimately, United secured the signatures of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, whereas Liverpool brought in the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Spurs meanwhile completed a £55m deal for Mohammed Kudus from West Ham United. Nevertheless, having already netted six Premier League goals so far this season, the sensation could find himself back on the radar of those clubs when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Manchester United are beginning to find their form under the guidance of Ruben Amorim, but doubts persist over the suitability of Sesko as their main striker, given his youth and lack of experience at the highest level.",
      "United have also been linked with several other forwards ahead of the January window, including Karim Adeyemi and Real Madrid's Endrick.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A reported Manchester United transfer target has been fined £396,000 after admitting to possession of a pair of brass knuckles and a taser.",
      "The case against Borussia Dortmund and Germany star Karim Adeyemi was concluded by a district court in Hagen, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. According to The Athletic, the possession case dates back to 2024. Adeyemi has avoided a public trial and will not be given a criminal record.",
      "Instead, he must pay a fine that has been calculated at 60 daily rates of £6,600 (€7,500), 'in accordance with his salary and which started on October 30'. German law prohibits the possession of either item and can carry a sentence of up to three years in prison.",
      "In an official statement, Adeyemi's Bundesliga club, Dortmund, said: “BVB always takes criminal allegations seriously and uses them as an opportunity to discuss them with its employees while respecting confidentiality obligations.”",
      "Adeyemi is currently with the German national team ahead of their World Cup Qualification match against Slovakia on Monday evening. Team boss Julian Nagelsmann was questioned by reporters on the matter during a press conference on Sunday, but has remained tight-lipped for now.",
      "He said: “The issue is a bit too big before such an important game, for all of us and for German football. Therefore, I will not comment on any further inquiries — regardless of their nature.”",
      "Adeyemi's performances on the pitch have made him the subject of transfer interest from the Premier League and in particular, Manchester United. The 23-year-old is under contract until 2027, but is reportedly unsettled at Dortmund, with the January transfer window approaching.",
      "The winger, who can count Jurgen Klopp amongst his admirers, has three goals and five assists so far this season in 14 appearances, but clashed with Dortmund manager Niko Kovac recently when he was substituted and threw a bottle at the bench.",
      "“I think that's unnecessary,” the Dortmund manager said. “It's okay that he can be angry sometimes, but that's unnecessary; he's an adult.”",
      "According to Bild, Dortmund want to negotiate a new contract with Adeyemi, but his new agent, Jorge Mendes, wants to include a £70million release clause in any new deal.",

      "The midfielder became the first British-born South Asian to represent Manchester United and the first to play in the Champions League. Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

      "This timeframe would see Sesko miss United's Premier League matches against Everton, Crystal Palace and West Ham. If Sesko does not return in time to face Wolves, either, he may also be in danger of missing the clash at home to Bournemouth on December 15.",

      "\"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me. My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, 'Is it true this club's interested?' I'm like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn't know'.\"",

      "Manchester United reportedly turned down the chance of swapping Alejandro Garnacho for Romeo Lavia this summer, despite the Chelsea star previously impressing Pep Guardiola.",
      "Garnacho's future at Old Trafford was cast into speculation at the end of last season, when the forward criticised his club's lacklustre Premier League campaign, which saw them finish at a lowly 15th.",
      "After a summer of discontent, the 21-year-old snagged a £40million move to Stamford Bridge, while Ruben Amorim welcomed a new front line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to strengthen his attack.",
      "However, as per ESPN, instead of a straight money deal, it is understood that United were offered Chelsea star Lavia as part of the deal for Garnacho, which could have gone a long way in addressing the Reds' midfield woes at present. The club were linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, before his club's £100m price tag eventually proved too rich for United's taste.",
      "And despite Bruno Fernandes recently settling into a more central role alongside Casemiro, as Amorim starts to turn the tide in the north west, many fans would still argue that their Portuguese skipper is more suited as a number 10. Casemiro is also entering the twilight years of his career and has faced criticism for his lack of mobility as of late.",
      "While United are tipped to re-enter the transfer market when it reopens in January to secure an upgrade for their engine room, whether that be in the form of another pursuit of Baleba or potentially VfB Stuttgart stalwart, Angelo Stiller, life could have been made easier if they had taken the supposed deal that Chelsea were offering with regards to Lavia.",
      "If Guardiola's past assessment of the defensive midfielder is anything to go off, United could've banked themselves quite the player, though the Belgian has had huge fitness issues over the last few years. After breaking through the youth academy of Manchester City in 2021, Lavia secured a transfer to Southampton the following year, where he racked up 34 appearances for the Saints.",
      "And looking ahead to a clash between City and Southampton back in April 2023, Guardiola was quick to hail the progress of the Belgian talent. He said at the time: \"I am really impressed with what Romeo has done and is doing.",
      "\"We had, and we have, an incredible opinion about him. We thought to keep him, but maybe he would not (get) enough minutes like he has in Southampton.\"",
      "After an incredible breakthrough season at St Mary's, Lavia secured a move to Stamford Bridge which is thought to have set Chelsea back in the region of £58m. Despite making 30 appearances for the Blues to date, he has struggled to find his footing in Enzo Maresca's plans.",
      "Not only has the 21-year-old got stiff competition in the likes of Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo for his place, but he has also struggled with injury since arriving in west London, facing ankle, thigh and hamstring injuries in the past two years, as well as muscle strain.",
      "It appears as though United are thriving with their current engine room at present, with the Reds currently sitting 7th in the Premier League standings with five wins, three draws and three losses from their opening 11 matches. They are also unbeaten in their last five league outings.",
      "Amorim will have a tough task ahead to retain his unbeaten streak when United return to Premier League action next Monday, as they host an Everton outfit that is enjoying a new lease of life under David Moyes. They then face Crystal Palace on Sunday, 30 November, as the hectic Premier League period continues.",

      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",

In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",

      "Manchester United fans will have eagerly taken in Casemiro's latest Brazil masterclass as the midfielder looks to tie down his spot in Carlo Ancelotti's plans. And the midfield maestro turned the clock back as he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "He and Chelsea winger Estevao each contributed as the Selecao continue to make progress under former Real Madrid chief Ancelotti. And the response from Brazilian media suggests United star Casemiro will indeed have an important role to play at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The major question for United fans is whether that will be as a United player, with Casemiro's contract due to expire next summer. The club hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension to his stay, and Casemiro has been making a strong case despite his eye-watering £350,000-a-week salary.",
      "News outlets in his home country have nevertheless been raving following his impressive performances for his national team this season, with his latest display showing he \"has evolved\" at a late stage in his career while also becoming his side's \"main leader\" ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report of the win against Senegal in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "The 33-year-old has shown that in spades of late, having collected three goals and one assist in his last four outings for club and country. Casemiro, who was recalled to the Brazil squad by Ancelotti after a two-year hiatus, is expected to contribute in more areas for United than he was during his days at Real, and that has helped redefine his importance at both levels.",
      "After securing a new role as a playmaker in Ancelotti's side, it also appears the midfielder could well be heading to the World Cup with a starting spot following his latest impressive performance.",
      "\"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night,\" read an excerpt of Globo's report. \"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup.",
      "\"Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense piled on with their praise by suggesting Ancelotti has indeed found his preferred formula: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has received the seal of approval from club legend Sir Alex Ferguson following an impressive run of form.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper joined the Red Devils from Belgian side Royal Antwerp for just over £18million toward the end of the summer transfer window. Since then, he has established himself as the first choice under Ruben Amorim, starting each of the last five games.",
      "While he has kept only one clean sheet in that time - a 2-0 win over Sunderland - three victories mark a significant improvement on the start of the season and have lifted United to seventh in the table, just a point off the top four.",
      "Having missed out on Europe altogether after a dismal league finish last term, reclaiming their place near the top of the table is imperative for Amorim’s side this season.",
      "So far, so good for United, as Ferguson believes the signs are encouraging in light of recent results. Praise rarely comes higher from a United perspective, given what the Scot achieved during his lengthy tenure, and he has been particularly impressed by Lammens as well as Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,” Ferguson said in an interview with Raceday RTV. “Particularly the goalkeeper - he’s been outstanding. He’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "“Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, have added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - and the signs are getting better.",
      "“I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where improvement requires patience, they’ll enjoy it now.”",
      "The goalkeeper position has been something of a problem area for United in recent years following the departure of David de Gea in the summer of 2023. Andre Onana was initially signed as his replacement for a hefty £47 million from Inter Milan, but despite some positive moments, the Cameroon international never fully convinced as United’s long-term solution.",
      "Amorim handed Turkey’s Altay Bayindir an opportunity at the start of this season to stake his claim, but he too struggled to convince, prompting United to return to the transfer market. Now, just a few months into his time at the club, Lammens already looks like a smart piece of business and someone capable of making the position his own.",
      "After the international break, United face a crucial run of fixtures in the build-up to Christmas, with winnable matches against the likes of Everton, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa. With full focus on Premier League football, climbing the table and breaking into the top four will be Amorim’s priority in the weeks ahead.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Liam O'Brien has admitted that it took Sir Alex Ferguson a couple of years to speak to him again after choosing to join Newcastle in 1988.",
      "O'Brien moved to Old Trafford in 1986 after impressing for Shamrock Rovers in his home country, Ireland. He would spend a little over a year and a half in Manchester before deciding to move to St James' Park.",
      "The midfielder only made 34 appearances for the Reds but that did not stop Ferguson from being livid with the Irishman for choosing to leave. Reflecting on the conversation he had with the legendary manager ahead of the release of his new book Pass Master, O'Brien told Chronicle Live: \"I didn’t expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",
      "\"'I have something to tell you,’ I said. ‘I’m after signing for Newcastle United.’ There was a moment of silence.",
      "\"A pregnant pause. He wasn’t one bit impressed. He went through me. Who did I think I was walking out of a club like Manchester United?",
      "\"After he had his say, the phone went dead. Suddenly.",
      "\"It took some time for Alex Ferguson to talk to me again. When I met him a few months later, he didn’t speak. Eventually, the ice did thaw – although it took a couple of years.",
      "\"There were suggestions made that Alex and myself had this big bust-up before I left Old Trafford but that wasn’t the case. There was no big row.",
      "\"Did I have regrets that I left Man United – especially considering what they achieved later under Ferguson? No, I didn’t and don’t now, all these years later.\"",
      "Despite his relationship with Ferguson turning frosty upon his departure, the now 61-year-old can remember a time when the Scottish manager showed his softer side. After being sent off on his debut for United away at Southampton live on TV, O'Brien found himself under scrutiny like never before.",
      "Sir Bobby Charlton even stormed the team bus before it departed the south coast to lambast O'Brien for his tackle on Mark Dennis. But the ex-midfielder said that Ferguson was a lot more understanding about the situation.",
      "\"I played on ITV against Southampton. Sir Alex Ferguson gave me my debut for Man United down at the Dell,\" he added.",
      "\"In Ireland, it was the first time I think live football had been on from England, so all my friends and family were watching. I got told to watch out for Mark Dennis in midfield and that he was 'nasty'.",
      "\"I went in for a tackle and Dennis came off worse, I thought it would be a yellow card, back in the day you'd get a caution. Then the ref pulled out the red card after 85 seconds.",
      "\"I went back to the dressing room knowing everybody had been watching at home. It brings you to a dark place and you wonder how things will go for you at a club like Man United. Fergie actually thought I'd insulted the ref.",
      "\"He watched the video back with me on the team bus. But he didn't fine me because he knew it was the wrong decision.",
      "\"All managers have good sides and bad sides. You have to show some type of ruthlessness to be a manager.",
      "\"But Fergie cared about his players first. He was like [Kevin] Keegan and would always back his players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has enjoyed a turnaround at Manchester United after an awful start to the campaign.",
      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby Town and were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City, which cranked up the pressure on Amorim.",
      "Amorim had not won back-to-back Premier League games since his arrival, but the United boss enjoyed an outstanding October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches.",
      "United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m). The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight.",
      "As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "However, The Sun have reported that this will not be the case as Zirkzee looks set to remain at Old Trafford. It has been claimed that the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of leaving United in the New Year.",
      "The report claims that the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which will be expected to see Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo be unavailable for several weeks, is influencing United's decision-making for the January window.",
      "It's because of this that Zirkzee has reportedly been told that a transfer in January will not be possible, with the expectation now that the forward will get more game time across December and January.",
      "Various reports have been claiming for some time that Zirkzee would seek a chance to leave United in January in search of more regular first-team football, but if the latest article is accurate then that may not be possible.",

      "The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "\"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly,\" said Carsley.",
      "\"It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s. You can see he's a good talent.",
      "\"I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time. I think he trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "In October, Lacey spent time training with the England senior squad under the watchful eye of boss Thomas Tuchel when he was drafted in from age-group sides to assist ahead of the friendly win over Wales.",
      "His international showings are reward for a strong start to the season with United at Under-21 level. He's got five goal contributions in eight games across the Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy, while he was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer, with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey, who featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14, signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "But the main point here is that right now all of them are at serious risk of missing the World Cup, with Sweden already looking mighty relieved to have that Nations League-based safety net to get them into the play-offs because they sit forlornly right at the very bottom of their qualifying group, 12 whole points behind perennial qualifiers Switzerland and nine behind second-placed Kosovo.",
      "That wretched form means they can’t be given much hope of grabbing one of the four places 16 teams will fight for next March, despite the quality in their ranks.",
      "",

      "A damaging 2-1 defeat to Finland on the back of the Lewandowki spat meant that by the time the September internationals came along, Probierz was gone and Lewandowski was back for an impressive 1-1 draw in Holland secured by Matty Cash’s late equaliser.",

      "If you’re of a mind to discount Erling Haaland as an all-round footballer and still see him purely as a goalscorer despite plenty of evidence to the contrary this season, there’s a fair case to be made that Antoine Semenyo has been the Premier League’s best player this term.",
      "Semenyo’s six goals and three assists puts he’s second behind Haaland (14 goals; 1 assist) in the Premier League goal-contribution charts and the Ghanaian passes the eye test with flying colours with his wonderfully rangey running style and an astonishingly rare ability to be just as devastating off his left or right foot.",
      "Amid interest from Tottenham and Manchester United in the summer and Manchester United and Liverpool now, it’s a case of when and not if Semenyo moves on from Bournemouth, and The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the 24-year-old looks set to leave the Vitality Stadium at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "Only a week ago Fabrizio Romano claimed it was “very unlikely” that Semenyo would leave in January, but Ornstein now says the Cherries ‘reluctantly accept they may be powerless to prevent his exit’ in the winter window, with his release clause ‘formally set at £65m’.",
      "It would be a significant blow to Bournemouth, but they have arguably (and incredibly) improved having sold left-back Milos Kerkez, winger Dango Outtara and centre-back pair Dean Huijsen and Ilya Zabarnyi in the summer. And Ornstein added that the clause ‘must be activated by a specific date, which would give Bournemouth a couple of weeks to replace their best player’. Probably with another gem to be sold for huge profit in future.",
      "The revelation is sure to bring more suitors than Manchester United and Liverpool to Semenyo’s door as £65m is a very reasonable price for a player of that much ability whose ceiling we suspect is yet to come into view.",
      "It’s been claimed Liverpool would be Semenyo’s ‘top choice’ as he ‘wants to win the Champions League this season’, which is quite the flight of fancy. And if – as that report suggests – Semenyo is a man focused on the short-term, we would actually put Liverpool’s advantage over United in this fight down to their side being an altogether easier one to a) get into, and b) make a significant difference in.",
      "While we’re not convinced Arne Slot has the stones to drop Mohamed Salah, such is the inevitable impact his sulking would have on the dressing room dynamic, part of the problem with leaving him out is there being no obvious worthy replacement for him. Let’s face it, the Liverpool love-in for Federico Chiesa is far more about the song than the football.",
      "Semenyo walks into Liverpool’s starting lineup, in place of Salah on the right or on the left for Cody Gakpo, who’s been one of the Reds’ better players this season and is often picked out as a weak link when he’s in fact been the strongest, but doesn’t have the game-changing knack of Semenyo.",
      "Let’s be clear, the Semenyo we’re currently seeing gets in the United team too, just as he gets in every Premier League team, and would cement Benjamin Sesko to the bench if Ruben Amorim was to play him down the middle in a position he’s operated in before.",
      "But fast starts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo’s at Old Trafford means Semenyo’s inclusion in one of the inverted ten spots isn’t a formality, and is part of the reason why he wouldn’t have the transformative affect on United as he would on Liverpool, which really is quite something 11 games into the season after Arne Slot’s side doubled the Red Devils’ points tally in winning the title.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has reportedly told Bournemouth that Liverpool ‘is his top choice’ for a January transfer as he looks to win the Champions League.",
      "Liverpool have made an offer to sign Rodrygo ahead of the January transfer window as they continue to monitor Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘preparing to move fast’ to land a star Premier League winger in January before Liverpool and other big clubs can get there.",
      "Liverpool have learned their chances of a blockbuster January move for Semenyo amid strong new claims that he asked to leave Bournemouth.",
      "Liverpool target Antoine Semenyo has reportedly asked to leave Bournemouth in the January transfer window after the Reds made an approach.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed his verdict on reports linking Premier League giants Liverpool with AFC Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo."

      "England completed a successful 2025 in enormously predictable fashion.",
      "Another couple of wins. Another couple of clean sheets. Another couple of Harry Kane goals that don’t count. Another Daily Mail hatchet job on Jude Bellingham. Just your bog-standard international break for England these days.",
      "We already knew before it they’d be off to the World Cup, but are we any clearer now as to which specific players will be doing so?",
      "Here’s the latest all-important F365 England Ladder, with October’s rankings in brackets – you can read the full thing here.",
      "As ever, the rules of the Ladder are that this is not our ranking, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel is thinking. And he can be a tricky fella to read, sometimes, but we do think we’re starting to get a clearer idea now of what makes him tick.",
      "Which only makes it funnier just how far off the mark huge swathes of this will be by March.",
      "",
      "The easy part of the Ladder is still easy. We’re not even pretending to shuffle him down to two or three just to feel alive. He is still England’s most important and least-challenged player.",
      "Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of changes for the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of second-half substitutions in the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. And then scored the two late goals to complete the flawless qualification campaign. Because that is simply what Harry Kane does.",
      "He now has more international goals than Pele (without scoring a single one that counts), and his next England goal will lift him into the top 10 all-time for men’s international goals, level with Neymar and just behind Ferenc Puskas. Joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and the legendary Ali Daei in the 100 club is now very, very possible.",
      "With Ollie Watkins struggling for form and fitness and absolutely nobody else seemingly even in the frame, it’s even now possible that Kane winds up the only specialist No. 9 in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, with your Marcus Rashfords and Phil Fodens and the Cole Palmers of this world providing potential back up as nines of varying degrees of falseness. Tuchel himself described such a scenario as ‘possible’ but unlikely.",
      "And, of course, even describing Kane as a ‘specialist No. 9’ is to traduce one of the world’s very best players, who is also a more than handy No. 10, No. 4, No. 6 and No. 8.",
      "It’s a bit of a shame he went in goal that time for Spurs in the Lamela Rabona game and answered the question of whether he could play there too with such an emphatic ‘no’, because otherwise we’d strongly suspect he could.",
      "",
      "His usual serene, game-running self in the win over Serbia, but was one of several players left slightly discombobulated by Thomas Tuchel’s experimental approach to the first half in Albania.",
      "We’ve absolutely no problem with anything Tuchel tried in that first half – if not then, when? – and even the 3-2-2-3’s near total failure to launch taught the manager and us something useful. And equally we’re not really perturbed by the players struggling to get to grips with it.",
      "This was an experiment Tuchel justifiably felt able to implement because things were going so well; it will only be seen again if things are going so wrong.",
      "Rice was back to his usual self in the more familiar shape deployed in the second half, and remains as indelibly inked-in and integral as ever.",
      "Mandatory comment here about set-piece delivery and its potential outsized importance for the nitty-gritty of a major tournament.",
      "",
      "Kept another facile clean sheet in the first qualifier of the break, taking his personal clean sheet streak for England to 10 games since the 2-1 defeat to Greece at Wembley in October last year.",
      "Thomas Tuchel still hasn’t seen Pickford pick the ball out of his net in any England game he’s managed, which is a daftness no matter the level of opposition.",
      "Amusingly, the almost sarcastically under-employed Pickford was then rested for the final qualifier in Albania, and got to sit back and watch Dean Henderson have more to do in that one game than he’d had in the previous seven combined.",
      "",
      "It was a while before Tuchel was able to call on Stones, but since then he’s been a fixture in the side and that tells you something.",
      "There are still some who argue he’s in a three-way battle for two starting spots with Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa, but we’re increasingly convinced that pair are fighting to start alongside Stones.",
      "Whatever the truth of it, those three are now head and shoulders clear of anyone else in the centre-back conversation.",
      "Tuchel had spoken before about Stones’ midfield potential, and it was interesting – if not particularly successful – to see him try it out in that final game against Albania.",
      "",
      "Lovely goal against Serbia to deliver on a direct request for more goal contributions, and then came off the bench to set up the opener for Kane in Albania in what was a slightly curious half-hour cameo that featured one odd decision to try and tee up a team-mate when another goal appeared certain had he gone for it himself.",
      "Either way, still absolutely no reason to doubt he’s a certain starter on the right of England’s attack if all things are equal next June, despite the estimable competition provided by Noni Madueke and Jarrod Bowen. Both are enormously capable, neither is in Saka’s class.",
      "",
      "The speed with which Elliot Anderson has become the undisputed first choice in what was one of England’s problem positions alongside Declan Rice is pretty extraordinary. It really is only something that’s come about across this season’s three international breaks.",
      "Quietly impeccable again against Serbia at Wembley, and even earned (most of) a night off in Albania as Adam Wharton got his chance to impress.",
      "As ever, the Ladder is our estimation of the England manager’s position on players and when he talks we listen.",
      "“Elliot and Declan are at the moment ahead in midfield. They are a very good pair, and they complement each other very well.”",
      "We cannot argue with that, and have no desire to do so.",
      "",
      "Tuchel couldn’t help but – in our view unnecessarily – stir the pot with a bit of an OTT reaction to Bellingham’s pretty standard frustration at being substituted late on in Tirana, but the fact he got that start, the fact he was so eye-catching even when not at his best and, most importantly, the fact he is simply a better footballer than Morgan Rogers means we do now have just about enough evidence that when it comes to it and the real business begins next summer, Jude Bellingham will be England’s No. 10.",
      "It really is no slight on Rogers to suggest that by next summer the idea that six months earlier it was even a meaningful debate at all will look a bit odd.",
      "Still, though, this is based on what we think Tuchel is thinking and we’re still not entirely sure he’s as convinced this is a closed conversation as we are, so Bellingham’s upward movement remains conservative for now.",
      "But Bellingham is a generational talent and Tuchel absolutely knows this. Sorry, Daily Mail, there really aren’t ‘serious questions over his World Cup inclusion’ no matter how much that boils your hateful acrid p*ss.",
      "",
      "The eighth player we believe to be inked in to England’s starting XI for June, and the only reason he isn’t three or four places higher up the list is that even with the Ladder’s usual rules about assuming everyone is injury-free, we simply cannot even comprehend a universe where Reece James is reliably injury-free.",
      "Which is really bloody annoying actually, because he’s entirely and reliably excellent in every other way.",
      "",
      "Must have feared the worst when ruled out of this break through injury, but two things are true.",
      "First, when given the opportunity to select Gordon, Tuchel has generally selected Gordon.",
      "And second, neither Marcus Rashford against Serbia nor Eberechi Eze against Albania did enough to really suggest they can rip the starting shirt away from the Newcastle man.",
      "Also, when you think about it, the fact both Eze (against Serbia) and Rashford (against Albania) were far more impressive when coming off the bench to make a late impact only strengthens Gordon’s case to be the starter out of that trio.",
      "As far as missed international breaks through injury go, that was an absolute belter for Gordon. The team didn’t suffer any unpleasant consequences whatsoever, but nor did anything happen to remotely diminish his own standing and prospects. You’ll take that in the middle of such a busy season.",
      "",
      "Like Gordon, he was missing from this camp, and like Gordon it probably hasn’t done him too much harm.",
      "We thought he was in a straight fight with Ezri Konsa to start alongside John Stones, and we still think that after watching Konsa look very good against Serbia and Dan Burn look…not so good against Albania.",
      "At the very, very least his place in that group of top three centre-back options hasn’t been challenged, with Burn having a rough time and Jarell Quansah finally getting a debut but getting it in a weird and confusing right-back/right-centre-back-of-three hybrid role that didn’t really give him the best foundations upon which to attempt a bit of claim-staking.",
      "We think Tuchel slightly favours Guehi over Konsa, and don’t think we’re doing that thing where we project our own instincts on to the manager. Either way, if the sort of selection debate we’re worried about when the World Cup comes around is ‘Guehi or Konsa’ we will sleep easy in our beds knowing we don’t much care either way because it’s going to be absolutely fine. Given some of the scenarios we’ve had before, this one feels like extremely small beer.",
      "",
      "One of the key things we’ve learned about Tuchel thus far is that when you’re in, you’re in until you’re not. He’s already made it a feature of his selection methods as an international manager – worth remembering this is all new to him as well – that players who do the job for him will not be replaced just because some bigger or shinier name comes back in the fold.",
      "One exception to this, we think, is at left-back. It’s the one position where it feels like Tuchel really is still experimenting because he needs to, rather than resting players because he can or adapting to the availability picture in front of him.",
      "As such, we’re not quite willing to say that Nico O’Reilly’s pair of wonderfully assured performances in that position in this break have cemented his place. But it does now feel like his shirt to lose, even if that is pretty harsh on Djed Spence – who was exemplary on both flanks in October.",
      "Does feel like there’s still a fight here, though, one that your Lewis Halls and Myles Lewis-Skellys may yet have their say in as well.",
      "",
      "Had one particularly eye-catching moment when marshalling Dusan Vlahovic expertly against Serbia and as we’ve already said, we think he’s in a pretty close scrap with Marc Guehi to partner John Stones, and we are extremely comfortable with whichever way that particular cookie crumbles.",
      "His ability to do a very tidy job at right-back might, in a weird way, hurt his starting chances; in a major tournament you might not want to risk having to separate your starting centre-back pairing because Reece James is injured again.",
      "But that versatility absolutely locks down a squad place. We’re still very much in ‘on the plane’ territory here.",
      "",
      "Slips outside the starting XI now, we think. Is unlucky really to have Bellingham as his direct competition, and may eventually suffer from offering less squad-building versatility than other players who could potentially play at 10 but also offer options out wide, like Eberechi Eze or Cole Palmer or even Phil Foden.",
      "But he’s played better for England in that 10 role than any of those lads, and we know Tuchel values that enormously highly. He can have no complaints about anything Rogers has done for him, and while it wouldn’t enter our heads to do so it still wouldn’t entirely surprise us to see Rogers’ name on that starting team-sheet in seven months.",
      "As ever when discussing Rogers v Bellingham, we’re aware we can come off quite disparaging to the Villa man. We don’t mean to be. He’s excellent, we would be entirely unconcerned if England need to use him in tournament conditions. He played in every single game of what was a uniquely successful qualifying campaign for England.",
      "He’s just not Jude Bellingham.",
      "",
      "Had a busier game against Albania than Pickford has had against anyone in an England shirt this year, but for Henderson that’s probably a blessing. He actually got the chance to show Tuchel what he can do after being one of the players to suffer in the Senegal game, and kept a clean sheet that was nothing like the formality of so many of Pickford’s.",
      "There were smart saves and some good decision-making from Henderson. Nothing that has any chance of unseating Pickford as No. 1, of course, but the Albania game has absolutely solidified Henderson’s claim on first-reserve status, with James Trafford simply not playing any football and Nick Pope unfortunately ruled out after a hard-earned recall.",
      "",
      "If you’d told us a couple of years back that Jordan Henderson would be a Thomas Tuchel regular for England with a significant and clearly-defined role at his big age we’d have been so alarmed we probably wouldn’t even have registered our surprise at Thomas Tuchel being England manager.",
      "Now, though? We’re fine with it. He brings experience and leadership to the squad and his role within the squad is clear; he’s maybe fourth or fifth choice to actually start in central midfield, but absolutely first-choice sub to come on in there when there’s a job that must be done.",
      "",
      "Still seems like a straight fight between him and Anthony Gordon to start on the left for England and while it would be no surprise to see Rashford continuing to deliver the more eye-catching contributions at club level, where all his problems really do seem to have been solved by the one neat trick of simply joining one of the biggest football clubs on earth, we know how high a value Tuchel places on the work people have done specifically for him.",
      "And, given the opportunity in this window by Gordon’s injury setback, we’re just not sure Rashford did quite enough to shift the needle on the starting XI. Especially when he actually strengthened the idea that his best contributions might come from the bench by having his best contributions come against Albania, from the bench.",
      "",
      "Brilliant cameo from the bench against Serbia, drab performance from the start against Albania. Not sure exactly where that leaves us or more specifically Eze really, but overall probably roughly back where we started, which is: brilliantly talented, game-changing bench option anywhere across the attack but probably not really in serious contention for any starting position.",
      "We’re okay with it. Worth noting also that Eze, with three goals, was the only person not called Harry Kane to score more than once for England during this qualifying campaign. Feels like that definitely ought to count for something.",
      "",
      "We know Tuchel is a big Madueke guy, to the extent that if we take him at his word he wouldn’t even have recalled Bukayo Saka in October had Madueke not been injured himself.",
      "It makes him among the harder players to place in this Ladder, but we do think the only real option at this time is to go with Tuchel’s confirmed high opinion of a player who should be back fit and firing by the time the next squad comes around in March.",
      "Before his injury, Madueke was statistically perhaps the most important non-Kane attacker for England during this qualifying campaign, leading the way in both chances created per 90 and dribbles per 90.",
      "Second on both those metrics? Look away, Daily Mail, but it was that awful prick Jude Bellingham.",
      "But back to Madueke, it feels certain to us that Tuchel will at least give him a chance to reassert his claims to be at least first reserve on that right-hand side come March, and we’d be pretty confident at that stage that he would take that chance.",
      "",
      "Even further away from rivalling Kane for a starting spot than ever before – it really is mad to think now how the sight of Watkins replacing a lumpen and grimly ineffective Kane at the Euros was a source of such joy – but now finds his squad place under threat.",
      "Not from any other striker – don’t worry, Ollie, there aren’t any of those – but from the slim possibility that Tuchel might not bother with one at all.",
      "Given the paucity of the back-up options, sadly now up to and including Watkins himself, the magnificence of Kane and the multi-faceted nature of England’s great many other attacking talents, it becomes a tempting option.",
      "If you don’t have another No. 9 you’d really trust, but you do have, say, Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford and Cole Palmer, do you really need another No. 9 in there for the sake of it?",
      "We do still kind of think that in a 26-man squad the answer is probably ‘Yes, don’t be silly, we do still need another proper striker’.",
      "Tuchel sees it similarly, having said he will likely pick another ‘classic number nine’. That keeps Watkins above the 26-man cutline for now, but even the fact Tuchel is talking about the possibility of not having one, and pointedly refusing to dismiss the idea altogether (“I cannot rule out that we go with one striker, but it’s more likely we have more than one classic number nine”) while also not specifically mentioning Watkins by name mean it’s looking dicier than it probably should for someone with literally no meaningful competition at this time.",
      "",
      "Back in the fold and given a couple of different roles in the Serbia and Albania games as Tuchel tries to succeed where others have failed and unlock Foden’s obvious talents in an England setting.",
      "We do like the false nine option deployed against Serbia; anything that reduces the need for unnecessary spare Kane back-ups in the squad in favour of more versatile players is to be encouraged.",
      "The collective will for Foden to show what he can do for England perhaps led to be a bit of an over-reaction to his assist for Eberechi Eze’s goal – described in at least one place as ‘putting it on a plate’ for the Arsenal playmaker. But we’re not having it as the easy-peasy straightforward pass some naysayers have insisted it was on the other side of the debate.",
      "One of the advantages of having skilled finishers in creative positions is they know exactly what pass they would want to receive if roles were reversed, and Foden’s pass to Eze was exactly that. Perfect weight, perfect line, so that Eze didn’t have to break stride and a difficult finish was made as easy as it could be.",
      "Against Albania, we even got a brief glimpse of the Foden-Bellingham-Kane triangle Tuchel had previously dismissed as impossible. So there’s definitely hope.",
      "It still feels like at least one ludicrously talented attacking player is going to miss out when Tuchel’s final 26 is named, but it’s less likely now than it was a fortnight ago for Foden’s to be that name.",
      "",
      "Appears to be fourth-choice centre-back. As sanguine as we are about the first three centre-backs, this fills us with some kind of dread.",
      "We would really very much like something more compelling and bit less cumbersome to make itself known by March, please and thank you.",
      "He’s a good lad is Burn, and it’s been a great story. But we really don’t think he’s good enough, and he’s now the one player we’ve got inside the 26-man cutline about whom we have those kind of deep-lying fears.",
      "",
      "Time is running out and others are making strong claims for all sorts of roles within England’s attack. As we’ve said time and again elsewhere, there are simply more excellent attacking players available to Tuchel than squad positions for them all and someone deserving of a place – probably multiple someones – is going to miss out.",
      "And there is a real risk that Palmer, who has played only 64 minutes for England under Tuchel in their least convincing performance (the 1-0 win over Andorra), is such a someone.",
      "Probably not. Still probably not. On balance, his ability and versatility still probably tip the scales far enough his way. Especially if he can recover sufficient goalscoring touch to convince Tuchel he can offer a meaningful option as the focus of England’s attack rather as well as one of its support riders.",
      "Does feel quite mad to be talking about someone we tried and failed to squeeze into the F365 England starting XI perhaps missing out on the squad altogether, but that’s the level of competition.",
      "There will, inevitably, be stuff in here that looks absolutely mental come March. Because that’s four months away, and there’s stuff that looks mental from one Ladder to the next when there’s only one month between them.",
      "But we really hope ‘Palmer might not even make the squad’ is one of the things that looks really crazy by March.",
      "",
      "A touch overpromoted in October on the back of our desire for neatness and trying to make the first 11 names on the ladder represent an actual starting XI, but despite being a non-playing member of the squad in this break he doesn’t fall too far.",
      "Tuchel’s obvious dislike of Spence’s infamous Thomas Frank snub after the Chelsea game felt a bit OTT and quite schoolmasterly to us – and also quite funny given Tuchel’s own history with handshakes at the end of games between Chelsea and Tottenham – but can’t be ignored either given the Ladder’s remit.",
      "But we still think Tuchel values Spence’s pure defensive ability as a full-back with tough major tournament tests in mind. He might not be first choice or even necessarily first reserve on either flank, but we’d still be surprised to see him left out altogether because he does offer that one-on-one ability to nullify the best, and that’s a powerful weapon to have in the arsenal for a player who is also perfectly capable of starting any game at full-back on either flank.",
      "",
      "Could return to Newcastle this weekend after missing their last nine games through injury, and no specialist has staked much of a claim to be the second right-back in the squad.",
      "Djed Spence, Ezri Konsa and Jarell Quansah have all been used there in addition to obvious first choice Reece James, and that can’t do Livramento any harm.",
      "And while Spence in particular offers a solid defensive option on that right-hand side, we’re still not sure you’d really want to be picking a 26-man squad in which Reece ‘Darren Anderton’ James is your only specialist right-back.",
      "Livramento, despite his own recent injury struggles, hasn’t really been usurped at all in the fight to be that second specialist right-back.",
      "",
      "We’ve desperately wanted to put him higher and higher in the Ladder but couldn’t because it’s the England manager’s Ladder, not ours. And for some inexplicable reason, we are not the England manager.",
      "We really do think Wharton, with his vision and line-breaking passing ability is the kind of high-risk, high-reward player you want in a tournament squad. There’s a make-something-happen quality to him that doesn’t really show itself in stats or data. He’s an old-school player who absolutely has to be watched to be appreciated.",
      "A bit unfortunate to get his chance in an experimental formation, one that confused more experienced international minds than his, but still did well even when often finding himself as a pretty isolated single-pivot in England’s midfield.",
      "Tuchel acknowledged as much after the Albania game, while also stressing that isolation was not Wharton’s fault. We’ve heard enough: Tuchel likes him, up the list he goes to join Rice, Anderson and Henderson among Tuchel’s World Cup midfield options.",
      "",
      "Lucky to get a reprieve and find himself in this squad with Nick Pope suffering cruel injury timing, and for now that means, with the clock ticking and only one more England camp before final squad choices are made, we’re leaning towards Tuchel sticking with what he knows for such a low-key position as third-choice keeper.",
      "But if by March Pope is playing well for Newcastle and Trafford is still riding the bench at Man City, he can have few complaints if he loses even that bench-warming position for his country.",
      "",
      "Was England’s best and most consistent attacking threat in that disjointed first half against Albania and we do really like the energy that Bowen brings to the table. Does feel like he offers a tangible point of difference as a right-wing option in comparison to Saka and Madueke.",
      "But Bowen surely sits behind that pair in Tuchel’s thinking when everyone’s fit, and that leaves the West Ham man in some significant danger of finding himself without a seat when the music stops next year. He’d be desperately unfortunate to miss out on the squad, but we’re finding it increasingly hard to work out how Tuchel can possibly pick a coherent, balanced squad without some enormously talented attacking players being desperately unfortunate.",
      "Unless there’s a wild injury crisis, and we really don’t want to wish that into existence no matter how much easier it would make this – ultimately trivial – Ladder to compile.",
      "",
      "Got a long-awaited and deserved debut, but got it at right-back. Or kind of right-centre-back in sort of a three-man defence but not really. In the hardest game of an admittedly easy group.",
      "It was not fertile ground for making a great impression, but Tuchel certainly seemed to like what he saw. Personally, we thought the ‘like he had 50 caps already’ quote was a bit odd and that Quansah had done, at best, a serviceable job in an unusual position that wouldn’t really be anyone’s speciality and certainly not his.",
      "What that ringing endorsement must do, though, is shove him up this Ladder a fair few places. That fourth centre-back spot is still there to be claimed, and incumbent Dan Burn is far from secure.",
      "",
      "Deserved his recall and was desperately unlucky to miss out on it through concussion. Still has every chance of unseating Manchester City bench-warmer James Trafford as the third-choice keeper, but time is now tight.",
      "",
      "Not as good as Jude Bellingham, and more importantly not as good for England as Morgan Rogers. And Thomas Tuchel seems wildly unlikely to find room in his squad for a third No. 10 when he has so many other elite and versatile attacking choices.",
      "",
      "Is now on the outside looking in and simply doesn’t appear likely to get the opportunity to play enough football to prove to anyone why that shouldn’t be the case.",
      "There will, very obviously, be a great many more tournament chances for MLS, but it does currently seem like this one is slipping away.",
      "",
      "We have never, ever really known what to do with him in the England Ladder, and we still don’t know what to do with him. Given we are literally no closer to squaring that circle than we were this time last month, we are going to quite literally repeat ourselves.",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "There is of course the other question: is he even a right-back? But that only makes things even less clear, and is thus a question we will ignore at this time.",
      "",
      "At this stage it really is starting to feel like wish fulfilment having him in the list at all. But we must allow ourselves the odd indulgence.",
      "READ: The discarded England XI without a hope of a World Cup squad place",

      "Fifth-choice central midfielder? If he’s lucky. Will Tuchel pick five central midfielders? If he’s lucky.",
      "",
      "Got himself into the squad, which was good, but didn’t get himself onto the pitch, which is not. The call-up was deserved recognition for some eye-catching displays for Bournemouth, but the harsh truth is that when naming international rookies in a tournament squad it’s easier if they’ve at least got some halfway relevant experience from big European nights and the like.",
      "It’s an example of big-club bias, but also a pretty understandable one. If you’ve got two inexperienced options going into a major tournament and one of them has experience under a big-club microscope, that player presents a lower risk.",
      "",
      "We’re increasingly certain Tuchel was just messing with us here, the scamp.",
      "",
      "Still knocking around the squad and that has to mean something, but the longer his one and only cap remains the 3-1 defeat to Senegal, the greater the chance his fate is to end up 10 years from now as a missed answer in a Sporcle quiz because everyone has forgotten that’s how he spells his first name.",
      "",
      "There’s a squad place absolutely there to be grabbed. Solanke seems to have spent almost the entire season one or two weeks away from a return, but if he can show any kind of form for Spurs between now and March he’s going to give himself a chance.",
      "It’s quite damning that this is true, but that’s not Solanke’s fault. Opportunity, somehow, still knocks.",
      "",
      "Is it really as mad an idea as it sounds? He is still, incongruously, only 30 years old. But for a tournament schedule, yeah, it probably is a bit mad.",
      "Has been almost ever-present for Manchester United this season, but that is in its own way damning; how much of his ability to play almost every game for United has been down to United having, through their own incompetence, a laughably light fixture list?",
      "Even United will now sometimes have to play a couple of games a week, what with the Busy Festive Period and all. If Shaw continues to play as many of the games as he has up to now, then he could yet get his name back into the conversation.",
      "The other awkwardness here, of course, is that the England vacancy that potentially exists is at left-back, a position that doesn’t exist in Ruben Amorim’s system at Man United.",
      "",
      "Latest talk is that his Everton comeback might not now come until January, despite apparently being close to a return for last month’s clash with Man City.",
      "If that is the timeline it’s going to be mighty hard for Branthwaite to muscle in on the squad but there is a cliff drop after England’s first three centre-backs that offers hope. Please, let it offer hope. We need it to offer hope.",

      "The striker market dominated this summer’s transfer window and this could also be the case in the 2026 window.",
      "This is because Lewandowski, who remains one of the best strikers in the world, is due to become a free agent next summer and looks increasingly likely to leave Barcelona.",
      "The 37-year-old goal machine has seven goals in 12 matches despite having limited minutes due to a muscle injury and Marcus Rashford’s sensational form, but it appears that the Spanish giants are preparing a succession plan.",
      "Rashford is currently doing nothing to harm his hopes of joining Barcelona permanently. Therefore, Man Utd face losing their academy product for a bargain £26m fee, with Harry Kane, Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland mooted as possible replacements for Lewandowski.",
      "READ: World Cup turncoats include £50m Manchester United signing and iconic winner’s son",
      "So, it appears that Lewandowski’s future lies elsewhere, but his recent form indicates that he still has plenty in the tank and it would be a waste of his talents if he opted for a move to the Saudi Pro League, as requested by Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Fabrizio Romano has named Manchester United’s ‘dream’ midfield signing and both he and sources at TEAMtalk have confirmed the player wants to join the Red Devils.",
      "It’s no secret Man Utd are on the hunt for impactful additions in central midfield next year. However, what’s less clear is which of the countless players they’re linked with they actually want to sign, and of those, who is number one on the shortlist.",
      "From just the Premier League, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson are understood to be in Man Utd’s crosshairs. From further afield, the likes of Conor Gallagher and Angelo Stiller have been mentioned.",
      "United may yet make multiple additions in midfield, but obviously will not sign five new players in the same position. And per the latest from transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, we now know who United will give priority to signing before all others.",
      "“There is a lot of confusion in the media [about] who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield,” began Romano when speaking on his YouTube channel.",
      "“My information remains that there are several names, but I keep telling you since August, don’t forget Man Utd want Carlos Baleba.",
      "“Baleba wants to go to Man Utd. Man Utd want Baleba. The conversations with the player and his agents were very good but at that time in August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player.”",
      "United made an official approach to Brighton for Baleba in the summer window, but were informed a deal could not be made at that time, irrespective of how much United bid.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in the 21-year-old has maintained and Romano then stressed a winter window move will be “difficult,” with a summer swoop in 2026 the likelier scenario.",
      "“In January it’s likely to be a difficult deal,” the reporter continued. “Brighton insist on not selling the player [in January].",
      "“But for the summer, unless the stance changes in January, let’s see what happens… but the summer of 2026, for sure, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.”",
      "Romano concluded by stating Man Utd will “insist” on signing Baleba next year and and the player is “very keen” on making the move.",
      "At the time of United’s approach for Baleba in August, it was widely reported the Cameroon international was receptive to the interest but was not actively seeking to leave Brighton.",
      "However, Romano categorically stated Baleba now “wants to go to Man Utd” and that echoes what our own insider, Dean Jones, reported on Sunday.",
      "Jones revealed Baleba “clearly wants the move” and United’s summer approach – which may have been launched with one eye on turning the player’s head ahead of a move in 2026 – appears to have succeeded.",
      "The player is now unsettled on the south coast and would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford. However, Brighton – who previously valued Baleba in excess of £100m – won’t go down quietly.",
      "Baleba is contracted to the Seagulls until 2028 and there’s an option for an extra season. As such, Man Utd’s biggest issue now is negotiating a more palatable fee with Brighton, but one that is still convincing enough to get their green light.",
      "Jones exclusively told TEAMtalk on Sunday: “It is being talked about again that Baleba is a priority target, but it has to be stressed that they [United] are not paying £100million for him any time soon.",
      "“The player clearly wants the move, and their attempt to turn his head in the summer has worked, but his form has actually been worse since then, and so I do not see United going close to the level Brighton value him at.",
      "“The message remains clear that United want a midfielder in January and also a midfielder in summer.",
      "“So they are working on targets that are attainable in each of those, and the ones from the Premier League seem unattainable in January. That’s how the picture is for now.",
      "“Obviously, these things can change, but Baleba is going to have to be very patient here because a lot is going on.",
      "“United do still like him; they do still think he would suit the role, but his form and valuation do not match up at the moment. And on top of that, Brighton don’t want to sell him in January.”",
      "In other news, insider Ben Jacobs has revealed it’s “absolutely true” that Manchester United want to sign a Newcastle star who director of football Jason Wilcox knows “incredibly well.”",
      "Elsewhere, Eric Cantona has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has “destroyed” the style of football created by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and the legend has revealed his offer to help the club was rebuffed.",
      "Finally, Manchester United scouts will be patting themselves on their backs for identifying a young midfield gem who has won a major award, but the Red Devils will not find it easy to negotiate a deal with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis."

      "Since then, there has been speculation about lots of different midfielders joining Man Utd in January with Conor Gallagher, Angelo Stiller, Baleba, Adam Wharton, Andrey Santos and Elliot Anderson some of the names linked.",
      "And now transfer expert Romano insists there are still a lot of names on the Man Utd shortlist for the winter window but that Baleba appears to be at the top of their list.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “I want to close this video with midfielders, guys, as many of you keep asking me. There is a lot of confusion in the media: who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield?",
      "READ: Man Utd still the club with most England caps, with Spurs ahead of Arsenal",
      "“My information, guys, remains that there are several names, and we will discuss all of them in the videos these days. But I keep telling you that Man Utd want Carlos Baleba and Baleba wants to go to Man Utd.",
      "“The conversation with the player and his agency is very good. In August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player. In January, it is likely to be a difficult deal again because Brighton insist on not selling the player. But for the summer, let’s say for 2026, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.",
      "“I gave you a video last summer saying Baleba will remain a target if the deal doesn’t happen now. Man Utd want to insist on the deal in 2026, and that remains the case. Man Utd still want Baleba and Baleba is still very keen on a move to Man Utd.",
      "“So, Baleba is a name we have to keep very high on Man Utd’s shortlist for the midfield.”",
      "Spanish website Defensa Central has claimed that current Man Utd midfielder Casemiro has been offered a new contract at Old Trafford with the Red Devils looking to more than cut his salary in half.",
      "The report adds: ‘United’s priority is to renew Casemiro’s contract for another year. His current contract expires in 2027, he earns £350,000 a week, and the Old Trafford club wants him to stay but on a much lower salary: £130,000 a week . This figure is ridiculous, and Casemiro will likely reject it. If that happens, [Aurelien] Tchouameni is the Red Devils’ first choice.’",

      "Arsenal are now leading Premier League rivals Man Utd the race to sign Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi, according to reports.",
      "The Gunners invested heavily over the summer with eight new players brought to the Emirates Stadium at a cost of over £250m.",
      "Arsenal now have two good players in most positions with their squad depth now up there with the best in the Premier League.",
      "However, the Gunners are still looking to strengthen their squad even further with rumours on Friday that they could add yet another central midfielder to their ranks.",
      "And now our friends at TEAMtalk insist that Arsenal may sign a new attacker in the January transfer window with Adeyemi at Dortmund in their sights.",
      "Adeyemi has been in and out of the Dortmund team since moving to Germany from RB Salzburg in 2022 with the 23-year-old often played as a right winger, centre forward or as an attacking midfielder.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Liverpool drop a full 15 places!",
      "The Germany international caused a stir in recent weeks when he threw a drinks bottle at the dugout when he was substituted by Niko Kovac in a recent 1-0 win over Cologne.",
      "Addressing the incident, Kovac told reporters: “I think that’s unnecessary. It’s okay that he can be angry sometimes, but that’s unnecessary, he’s an adult.”",
      "A report in German newspaper Bild claimed earlier this week that the relationship between player and coach is ‘strained’ and that Man Utd had ‘entered the fray’ to attempt to take advantage of the situation.",
      "It is claimed that Jorge Mendes’ appointment as the German’s new agent ‘adds further urgency to the situation’ with the Bundesliga side ‘aware that if Manchester United shows serious interest, Adeyemi’s future in Dortmund could become an issue sooner than many would like’.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal star ‘would start for Liverpool’ for two reasons as he’s told to ‘ask’ Arteta for January transfer\n👉 Tuchel dishes out ‘brutal ultimatum’ to Arsenal star as ‘next Bukayo Saka’ sparks transfer scramble\n👉 Arsenal ‘will look at selling’ Myles Lewis-Skelly on one condition as major clubs circle",
      "And now TEAMtalk claim that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta sees Adeyemi as the ‘ideal right-wing upgrade’ for Reiss Nelson as he looks for further goals and assists from attacking areas.",
      "It is understood that Dortmund will not accept less than £62m in January for Adeyemi, while the website insists that interest from Man Utd ‘remains fierce’ – but the forward’s ‘preferred destination’ is a move to London over Manchester.",
      "Arsenal’s transfer success rate was good over the summer with the signing of Martin Zubimendi hailed by former Gunners defender Philippe Senderos as the best of the summer.",
      "Senderos told AceOdds.com: “All of the new players have had an impact, but Zubimendi is the one for me who has had the most impact. He has really helped to balance the midfield and the squad. He has allowed Declan Rice to have a bit more freedom to make his runs, and that is what Declan Rice likes to do.",
      "“He doesn`t like to sit down and Zubimendi is that type of player. He has aggression and can move the ball very intelligently as well. He has been a fantastic signing for Arsenal and has added a lot to the squad.",
      "“You need a big squad if you want to compete and Eze will definitely have more highlights and top moments this season. The injury of Martin Odegaard was definitely not helping him and Arsenal, because we know the importance of Odegaard. He triggers the press and the forward movements, but Eze has done a good job finding space and we will see more from him.",
      "“I think Gyokeres` movement has been impressive. He will continue to make those runs and move like this. It is not easy to be a number nine at Arsenal because it comes with a lot of responsibility, but we will see many goals from him. He will get the service, but of course it takes time to adapt to the Premier League. He will still have to find his feet, but we have seen some important goals already and it looks like he fits very well with the rest of the squad.”",
      "",
      "Man Utd are ramping up their efforts to sign Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller and Borussia Dortmund’s Karim Adeyemi, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could attempt to sign Karim Adeyemi when the January transfer window opens after making contact over the striker, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have ‘restarted negotiations’ with the Atalanta star over a move to the Emirates this summer but a report claims the Gunners are ‘squeezing’ for an alternative."

      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed to improve the attack, and that’s clearly had an impact, with the Red Devils netting 19 goals in the Premier League so far – only the top three have scored more.",
      "The signings have meant for far fewer opportunities for Joshua Zirkzee this season. The Dutchman was signed last summer but struggled in his debut season, netting only seven goals in more than 40 games.",
      "This term, it’s clear he’s not fancied, playing only 90 minutes across five appearances in all competitions.",
      "But still, The Sun reports he’s been told there is ‘no chance’ he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with United ready to ‘block requests’ from a number of players to depart mid-season.",
      "It’s explained that part of the reason United don’t want to let some players go in January is that they’ll lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to the African Cup of Nations over the winter.",
      "With Mbeumo going and Sesko having sustained an injury against Tottenham – though it’s not thought to be serious – there could be more minutes for Zirkzee.",
      "United would not want to struggle up top due to a lack of availability having let Zirkzee leave.",
      "The injury sustained by Sesko, meanwhile, has caused tension between United and Slovenia, with the national team not happy about their doctors not being able to look at the striker’s injury.",
      "While the documentation has now been sent to Slovenia, manager Matjaz Kek initially said: “With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents.",
      "“We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don’t have just anyone in this position.",
      "“I cannot comment, of course I have certain information and I am also in contact with Beni. I can’t say anything because officially we don’t know anything at all.",
      "“United haven’t contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player. The only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",

      "United got rid of some players who are surplus to requirements in the summer. Antony was sold after a woeful spell, as was Alejandro Garnacho, while Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund were all loaned out.",
      "The former pair of loan players are likely to make permanent exits come the summer.",
      "And Amorim shedding dead weight is set to continue. Tyrell Malacia has essentially gone missing in recent seasons and was loaned out last term.",
      "Upon his return, he has not played at all, and Romano revealed in October that the left-back will be allowed to leave in 2026.",
      "He said: “Tyrell Malacia, despite returning to training with the first team of Manchester United after a crazy window where he had several opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is not going to sign any new contract at Man United, and in any case, will leave the club for sure, 100 per cent in 2026..”",
      "Romano has reiterated that, stating for GIVEMESPORT: “At the moment, the most likely scenario is to part ways. This remains the intention on the club’s side for the future.”",
      "For Amorim, getting a signing made by predecessor Ten Hag – who he clearly doesn’t rate – off the books will be ideal.",
      "He has Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot and Diego Leon who can play on the left flank, as well as Luke Shaw who generally plays more centrally now. and the Portuguese boss has also been told that one of United’s academy is ready to step up.",
      "Former United scout Piotr Sadowski has said 18-year-old Harry Amass – currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday – could make an impact.",
      "He said: “Now, United are wary of bringing in youngsters. Amorim was supposed to be the one to do this, but the results haven’t been right, so he prefers to buy ready-made players.",
      "“Whether he has anyone to choose from in the backroom is another matter. In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”",
      "Whether Amass is given many opportunities in the United first team remains to be seen. He’s played just seven senior games for the club, but is impressing at Wednesday, where reports suggest he will be staying until the end of the campaign.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd defender Tyrell Malacia “will leave” in 2026 as he brings an update on Bruno Fernandes’ future.",

      "He’s scored just once for United so far but has begun to come into his own of late. The goal came in the 4-2 victory over Brighton, after a good performance against Liverpool in the game prior.",
      "Cunha averaged a 7.2 match rating on SofaScore through October, and through two games in November he’s averaging 7.0 per game.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",

      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",

      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",

      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
