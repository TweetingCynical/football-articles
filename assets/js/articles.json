      "Manchester United fans finally have a reason to smile. Ruben Amorim's men are through to the Europa League final after staving off a comeback from Athletic Bilbao in Thursday's semi-final second leg.",
      "United were the weaker side for most of the game but ended up romping to a 4-1 win, meaning that the tie finished 7-1 on aggregate. A brace from super sub Mason Mount as well as strikes from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund booked the Red Devils a ticket to Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "They'll face Premier League rivals Tottenham, a team which they've already lost to three times this season, in a two-fold final. Victory would not only mean that United have won a trophy in each of the last three years while marking Amorim's first taste silverware at Old Trafford, it'd see them qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of the club's hierarchy are desperate to see United back among Europe's elite not just for the prestige but the financial rewarded. The near-£100million boost would allow the Red Devils to splash more cash in the summer transfer window, although not everyone on their list of targets will require fee.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have the funds to sign Liam Delap this summer but any potential deal is expected to take some time. Delap, 22, is United's top target for a new striker in the window but the Red Devils could face competition from Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "The England under-21 international is understood to have a £30million release clause in his Ipswich contract which became active following the Tractor Boys' relegation from the Premier League. The Athletic report that United have enough cash at their disposal to sign Delap but are waiting on his decision.",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah on a free transfer. Germany international Tah has confirmed that he'll become a free agent when his contract at Leverkusen expires on July 1.",
      "Reports from Germany say that United are 'serious competitors' for the 29-year-old, with the Red Devils on the lookout for a new centre-back. Tah has also been linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, who tried to sign him last summer.",
      "Barcelona will listen to offers for vice-captain Ronald Araujo after his Champions League woes. Araujo, 26, apologised to fans on social media after being blamed for two of Inter Milan's goals during their agonising semi-final defeat on Tuesday.",
      "Despite his status at Barca, the Uruguayan defender - who can play at centre-back or right-back - is set to be available for €50m (£42m), according to Fichajes. Manchester United have been linked with Araujo before and want to sign a centre-back in light of Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans' respective contracts ending next month."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has made it clear that he's a huge fan of Casemiro, who's in for a massive pay rise if they win the Europa League final. Casemiro, 33, scored to put United in the lead as they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in their semi-final second leg on Thursday.",
      "Now the Red Devils have the chance to win the competition and in turn qualify for next season's Champions League. Playing in Europe's elite competition would earn the club between £80million and £100m - but it would also cost them.",
      "Casemiro's salary has been at the centre of speculation over his future, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe keen to lower the wage budget at Old Trafford and reportedly identifying the Brazilian as the kind of big-money signing that United shouldn't have made. But Amorim's opinion could weigh heavily, as the Red Devils boss appears to love working with Casemiro.",
      "Having scored the goal which put United 2-1 up against Bilbao, the former Real Madrid stalwart was immediately substituted and Amorim gave him a big hug to congratulate his performance, prompting a huge cheer from the crowd. Casemiro also bagged a goal in the first leg and was decisive with two assists at home to Lyon during United's dramatic quarter-final win last month.",
      "The Brazil international has gone from a much-maligned figure during Erik ten Hag's final months in charge to a key player for Amorim. The pair didn't click instantly, though, as Casemiro only started one of the Red Devils' 14 games between mid-December and the start of February, playing a possible 136 minutes out of a potential 1,290 minutes.",
      "\"We are in a league where there is a big intensity difference. Therefore I feel our team needs players with high intensity and sometimes we don't have them.\"",
      "Will Manchester United win the Europa League final? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Things have changed in terms of his playing time, although Casemiro is still up for sale - much like the rest of United's squad. Their looming bottom-half finish in the Premier League can't be ignored and the 33-year-old was part of a midfield which was dominated by Bilbao's for the first 70 minutes on Thursday.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been mooted as the likely destination, with Ronaldo's Al-Nassr reportedly keen. But could the riches of Saudi Arabian tempt him away?",
      "\"I have one-and-a-half years left on my contract and I would like to finish it here in Manchester,\" Casemiro told AS in February. \"I am comfortable here and so is my family. They have adapted, we speak English. I'm very grateful to the fans at Old Trafford and to the club. I am happy at club level. Happy on the bench? Of course not. That's something else.\""

      "Antony has hit the ground running since arriving in the south of Spain on loan from United and proven a key player in Betis' side. Already the 25-year-old has scored eight goals and added five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell since his blockbuster move.",
      "The ex-Ajax star looks set to depart Old Trafford once his loan ends having failed to break into Ruben Amorim's plans this season. While Betis appear a strong, early contender, United are likely to prefer a permanent deal where they can bring in a fee for the star.",
      "And Betis president Haro is well aware the task of securing the player's signature will not come easily, despite his apparent willingess to contnue at the club. The first task remains to prove persuading to the Red Devils.",
      "\"Keeping Antony as our own is very, very complicated,\" he said. \"We'll have a meeting with Manchester United to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player.",
      "\"It's about seeing the willingness of the player and Manchester United. The first filter is set by Manchester, and then the negotiation of the player would come, but that’s a long way off.",

If Amorim leads Manchester United back into Europe’s elite, or if Postecoglou maintains his record of winning a trophy in his second season with every club as a manager, it will paper over a lot of cracks.",
      "United have lost 16 out of 35 Premier League games this season and Spurs have lost 19. That’s absolutely shocking for clubs of their stature. But the all-English Europa League final in Bilbao later this month will offer one of them a get-out-of-jail pass, a golden ticket back to the big time.",
      "Tottenham have beaten United three times already this season, so they may be slight favourites. United, on the other hand, are the only club to go unbeaten through the whole Europa League campaign and Bruno Fernandes has provided a record number of assists in the competition.",
      "Do they have an advantage after playing in Bilbao only last week? I’m not so sure that’s relevant in a one-off cup final, although when United pitch up again at the San Mames they will know where the dressing rooms are and get their bearings quicker.",
      "United were twitchy for a while in their semi-final second leg at Old Trafford on Thursday night. When Mikel Jauregizar made a dent in United’s three-goal advantage from the first leg, you could sense the nervous shuffling of feet and anxiety around the place.",
      "But one thing I have learned in my first year as a manager is the importance of substitutions - Macclesfield subs scored 27 goals for us this season, and Amorim played his hand perfectly.",
      "It is always better to be pro-active than reactive with your subs, and United were losing control in midfield until Mason Mount came off the bench to enjoy the best half-hour of his career.",
      "His two goals were magnificent, and his all-round contribution - with Bruno dropping deeper to the No.6 role - was unbelievable. Mount’s United career has been tormented by a series of injury setbacks which have limited him to just 10 Premier League starts in two seasons.",
      "But he chose the perfect night to step up when Bilbao were threatening to become the first team in 134 ties to overturn a three-goal deficit from the first leg away from home. And for United to score seven goals across two legs against a side with the best defensive record in La Liga speaks volumes.",
      "Tottenham showed good character and sound game management to negotiate cold weather in the Arctic circle and Bodo/Glimt’s artificial pitch, and it should be a cracking final.",
      "Are United and Spurs the two worst teams, in terms of their domestic league positions, to contest a major European final? That’s debatable, although Aston Villa won the European Cup 43 years ago in a season where they finished 11th in the old First Division, so it’s not unprecedented for an English club to strike glory in Europe while going nowhere in the league at home.",
      "Yes, a trophy and Champions League football will paper over the cracks and camouflage a multitude of problems for Amorim or Big Ange.",
      "But like Newcastle, who are also likely to land a Champions League spot next season, one of them is going to win more trophies than Arsenal this season. And for Gunners fans, that’s got to hurt."

      "In recent years, Manchester United have had their fair share of transfer mishaps - and letting Scott McTominay is leave is looking like one of the worst. Since joining Napoli last summer, the Scotland international has lit up the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium with his energy, grit and goals, becoming a driving force behind the club's Serie A title push.",
      "Despite being one of United's more consistent performers during a turbulent period, McTominay was never truly celebrated at Old Trafford. That isn't the case in Naples, where the fans have rallied around him, nicknaming him 'McFratm' - a blend of his surname and the local word 'fratm', meaning 'bro'.",
      "Another moniker he's earned, 'The Bottle Opener', speaks to his knack for delivering breakthrough goals when they're most needed. But it isn't just his popularity that's surged - his market value has too.",
      "Napoli snapped him up for £25million, but his estimated value now sits at €40m (£34m), according to Transfermarkt. This rise is especially striking given his age of 28, and that his highest valuation at United topped out at £29m - offering yet another indicator of the club's inability to recognise what they had.",
      "Italian football icon Massimo Ambrosini has credited Napoli boss Antonio Conte with unlocking McTominay's full potential. \"His value has only gone up since he left Manchester United and the reason for that is Antonio Conte,\" he told JeffBet.",
      "\"Conte has created a team that gets the best out of his players and McTominay is perfect in the middle behind Romelu Lukaku. His value has definitely increased this season and I think that is down to the manager.\"",
      "With 12 goals in 33 matches - including 11 in the league - McTominay has been a major influence on Napoli's campaign. Holding a three-point lead atop the table, they're in a strong position to finish the season as champions if they maintain composure in their final trio of games.",
      "McTominay has delivered time and again with his performances and particularly with his goals, whether breaking the deadlock, equalising, or sealing victories. \"Scott is a complete player,\" Conte said back in September. \"He's versatile, who can be a trequartista behind the striker, he can be a mezzala in a three-man midfield, play in a two-man midfield or even wide in a 5-4-1 with licence to attack.\"",
      "More recently, Conte claimed that United consistently deployed McTominay poorly, failing to recognise what his true qualities were. \"He never had a main role at United that instead we have given him here,\" the coach said. \"He has grown a lot by working. Today he is [a] complete [player].\"",
      "Should Napoli finish the season as champions, it would mark only their second title since the Maradona era and just the fourth in their history. Their emotional 2022/23 triumph, led by superstar attackers Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, ended a more than 30-year wait.",
      "With both players having moved on, winning again this season would be a stunning feat. And with McTominay emerging as a new leader, Napoli may have found the next piece in their legacy-building puzzle - proof that great players don't always come with great fanfare."

      "Micky van de Ven insists Tottenham have \"nothing to fear\" against Manchester United in the Europa League final. The imperious Dutchman, who marshalled the Spurs defence to a second successive European away clean sheet in Norway against Bodo/Glimt, said of Ruben Amorim's side: \"They played Athletic Club, a really good team and it was 7-1 over the two games. \"So they've also shown some real quality in Europe. We knew it's going to be a different game, everything can happen in a final but we're not going there with fear, of course. \"We know our qualities, we know it's going to be a difficult game as Man United have also shown their quality in this European campaign.\"",
      "Tottenham are bidding to end their 17-year wait for silverware, however, it's also been 41 years since they last lifted a European trophy (UEFA Cup). Van de Ven is confident Ange Postecoglou's troops can now finally end that hoodoo by finishing a difficult season on the greatest of highs. He continued: \"Everybody goes to Bilbao to win a trophy. It has been a tough season and it will only be successful if we win the Europa League and get that trophy. \"To be in a European final with Tottenham is a big thing for the fans, the club and me personally, I'm really proud to be part of it. Van de Ven, who only played 135 minutes of Spurs' group campaign due to a hamstring injury, starred alongside influential captain Cristian Romero in Thursday's gritty victory inside the Arctic Circle. He paid tribute to the indispensable Argentine, hailing a captain's performance in the absence of injured skipper Heung-min Son.",
      "The 24-year-old said: \"Cuti's an unbelievable player. You can see that mentality wise. With the ball, without the ball, he knows how it is to play these types of games. \"You can see it in how he is, he shows so much to the rest, he helps the whole team. My partnership with Cuti we feel each other, he knows what to do, I know what to do, we back each other.\" Dominic Solanke, who netted in both legs of the semi-final, has warned his team-mates they cannot get trapped into thinking they have United's number - just because they've beaten them three times already this season. When asked if those victories can give Spurs confidence, he said: “Yeah, a little bit, but obviously it’s going to be a completely different game, different circumstances. “Finals are never easy. We’re both in the final for a reason, we’ve both done well in Europe, so we know it’s going to be a difficult game. Pressure is a privilege, when you’re at big clubs, you always want to be fighting for silverware\""

      "He ticked an awful lot of Bernabeu boxes. But Manchester United and INEOS acted decisively, knowing it would take big money - both in terms of transfer fee and salary - to tempt Yoro to Old Trafford.",
      "But in the form of a £52million fee and a five-year deal that started at £150,000 for an 18-year-old defender, they tabled big money. A pre-season injury was part of an unfortunate start to Yoro’s United career and he was hardly convincing in his early games for Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there are signs that Yoro, now 19, might just represent a rarity … an INEOS masterstroke. In his recent performances, he has been consistently good and was outstanding in the 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "From the time he was repeatedly skinned by Southampton’s Kamaldeen Sulemana back in January, it was clear that Yoro’s defensive approach is not based on raw speed. Instead, he is proving to be a fine reader of a game, astute with his interventions and an intelligent distributor of the ball.",
      "Remember any United centre-halves with that skill set? Yes - and it is no surprise Yoro has been picking his brains.",
      "“I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio (Ferdinand) and not always in front of the cameras,” says Yoro. “Sometimes, they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, then you need to take it.”",
      "And as the comparisons to Ferdinand began to be taken a touch more seriously, it is clear to see they are giving the young French defender a lift. He goes on: “Of course I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies.",
      "\"So, when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, (Nemanja) Vidic and (Raphael) Varane, you want to achieve the same things as them, you want to stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender. When they compare me to them it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this.”",
      "An odd report from Spain last week suggested his camp were exploring the possibility of getting him to Real Madrid after United's disappointing Premier League campaign. But Yoro looks like a player who is beginning to revel in the challenge facing United players of this era.",
      "He says: “It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned but now I’m 100 percent, I am starting to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season. I feel confident.”",
      "And looking ahead to the Europa League final against Spurs, Yoro is, of course, determined to start his United medal collection, declaring: “This is a club of trophies. When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this. We are Manchester United and we need to win trophies.”"

      "A former hooligan recalled risking his life on a brutal away day where he claimed ambushing fans were armed with bricks and Stanley knives. Tony O’Neill was once regarded as Britain’s most notorious football hooligan. Back in the 1970s, he became a key figure in two Manchester United firms, Red Army and later the Casuals, and hewas known as ‘the general’.",
      "But on April 23, 1974, he travelled to Merseyside when he was just 15 to watch a soon to be relegated United take on Everton at Goodison Park. And speaking on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series, he spoke about the chaos that unfolded.",
      "His mum initially forbade him from going but eventually he joined up with The Red Army who made their way to Liverpool.",
      "He said people had been speaking about the game for weeks. Tony remembered: “We knew what we was up against. This was going to be war. And I mean war. We were going to take on the scousers.”",
      "He said hundreds of United fans packed the trains before arriving at Lime Street Station where trouble immediately broke out. Tony said the group stood their ground before being welcomed by bricks once they started to make their way to the football stadium.",
      "“Bricks came flying over at us while we were on the march,” he said. “What a solid march, but a frightening walk if you were on your own or in small groups. But not this gang, this gang was massive and it was solid. There was no moving it.”",
      "He said this was a victory for the firm but the real violence took place after the match where Everton came out 1-0 winners in what was a night game.",
      "“I was depressed because I knew we were going down,” Tony recalled. “But we knew what we had to do. The gates open and we have got to be at the front. We knew the rules going there. This has always been the motto, go out there and whatever happens, happens. Take it to them. Don’t go hiding, don’t be sneaking off, especially in Merseyside.”",
      "Fights broke out outside Goodison Park but disputes between United fans took place where some wanted to get on coaches back to Lime Street and others wanted to march back.",
      "Tony was one of the ones who walked and he said it was “absolutely stupid” and the \"daftest thing you can do in the dark at Merseyside”. “You are going taking your life in your hands,” he added.",
      "Despite knowing he was going to get ambushed, Tony and the now smaller mob reached the end of Stanley Park, and that’s when the real danger commenced.",
      "“That was the nightmare of all nightmares,” he recalled. “They all were Liverpool fans. They just come screaming down the side street, straight into us.",
      "“Oh my God, I just bottled it. What is going on here? This is a nightmare. They had the street and they were running down it straight into us and people just bottled it straight away.",
      "“There is no disgrace in it whatsoever, you were outnumbered, in the dark, you were ambushed. And they caught us. I just legged it straight down.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t look behind me to see what is going on because this is now your life and you also know you are getting robbed, you are getting slashed, you are getting beat up, you are getting done in, there is no mercy here. They were out to get you and they were everywhere. I just kept running and didn’t look back. It is every man for himself.”",
      "Asked to elaborate on Stanley knives being present, he added: “Everyone was up for a fight, that’s what was happening up and down the country. But these took it to a different level and that was what you were fearful of.”",
      "Running for his life, Tony said bricks rained down on him, and at one point his shoe fell off, forcing him to kneel down while his two pals sprinted away.",
      "He described being “so relieved” to get back to Lime Station unharmed, calling it the longest run of his life. “I got away with my life, and I mean got away with my life,” he said.",
      "Speaking about the atmosphere on the train back, he said: “We were all made up. This is the blueprint of how we are going to go to Liverpool or Everton in the future. We knew we could take it to them - it just needed a little more organising.”",
      "Tony, now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black, then said within 18 months to two years, Manchester United became the main firm in the country. The former hardman now lives a very different life, and in 2017, he started working at Gary Neville’s and Ryan Giggs’ Hotel Football.",
      "He was handpicked by Neville to work security and speaking about his role, he once said: “I’ve stopped going to games. Me and my wife Debbie do the rooftop at Hotel Football on a match day.",
      "“The whole idea is to make it about the supporters’ clubs. The Hotel is a four-star, but the intention of the hotel was to be where the fans could mix.",
      "“The whole idea was to make it accessible, near Old Trafford, for the fans. I get the supporters clubs in. I get the right people in. People love to mix and see proper United fans.”"

      "Manchester United loanee Antony broke down in tears after clinching a place in the Conference League final with Real Betis. The winger opened up about the “very tough times” he faced at Old Trafford after his heroic performance on Thursday night.",
      "Antony played a starring role as Betis beat Fiorentina to reach their first ever European final. The Brazilian, 25, scored a phenomenal free-kick past his former Red Devils team-mate David de Gea in goal, curling it in off the post from distance.",
      "It marked his third game in a row on the scoresheet, having fired in a stunning volley from the edge of the box in the first leg to give his side a 2-1 lead heading to Florence. And with the tie hanging in the balance at 3-3 on aggregate, he proved the hero of the tie once more by setting up Abde Ezzalzouli with a squared pass for an extra-time winner.",
      "His team-mates rushed to celebrate with him as jubilant scenes broke out in the away end of the Stadio Artemio Franchi. And Antony couldn’t hide his emotions, bursting into tears on the pitch and in his post-match interview.",
      "The £86million winger said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here. I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "Antony was talking about his extremely difficult two-and-a-half years in Manchester, having been bought for an eye-watering sum in the summer of 2022 which put pressure on him from the outset. He was reunited with his former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag at United but failed to deliver for the English giants under the Dutchman and successor Ruben Amorim, resulting in him being brutally mocked and criticised throughout his Red Devils spell.",
      "Antony finally secured a loan exit from his United nightmare in January and has stunned the footballing world by appearing a completely different player in Seville. The Brazil international has eight goals and five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell.",
      "He has now etched his name into Betis folklore by playing a key role in their advancement to the Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea in Wroclaw, Poland, on Wednesday, May 28.",
      "Antony previously noted one reason for his upturn in form, saying: “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself. I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.",
      "“It [Seville] reminds me a lot of Brazil: the sun, the food, everything. The people are also very warm and happy; that's important for us who come from Brazil and are used to that. As I've said, I'm very happy.",
      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy. Seeing my family smiling is also essential for me; I always talk to my family in Brazil and they are also very happy for me.”"

      "Paul Scholes has backed Manchester United to win the Europa League as he attempted to compare the club's success in European competition to that of Real Madrid. United have won six European titles in their history.",
      "That includes the European Cup - now rebranded as the Champions League - on three occasions, the European Cup Winners' Cup once, the Europa League in 2017 and the European Super Cup in 1991.",
      "By contrast Madrid have 23 European titles to their name as the most successful club on the continent. Los Blancos have won the Europe's ultimate club prize an unrivalled 15 times, along with two UEFA Cups and six European Super Cups.",
      "But Scholes believes that the duo are alike in the fact that both can win big games in Europe even when they are not playing well. United have endured a dreadful campaign outside of the Europa League this season.",
      "They have still managed to reach the final of that competition though and will now face Tottenham in Bilbao at the end of the month. And Scholes has backed the Red Devils to go on and beat Spurs.",
      "\"When they aren't playing that well they can still go on and win European cups. I just feel the odds are slightly in Manchester United's favour. Although I do think Tottenham are a good side.\"",
      "United booked their place in the final by thrashing Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals. But they will now come up against a Spurs side who have beaten them three times already this season, with Ruben Amorim admitting his side face a difficult test.",
      "“It's the least we can do for these fans, for all the support that they gave us in this tough season. But I'm stressed already because of the final, because if you don't win it, in the end, it's nothing. So, we are happy to be there. Let's see,” he said.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a really good game. A little bit emotional because both teams are struggling a lot in the Premier League and want to win something. Two teams who play in the same league and know each other.",
      "\"It means a lot, not just to us but also for Tottenham. It means a lot, not just for me but also for Ange [Postecoglou], after this season. It's a massive game and I know it's going to be tough for the people in Bilbao because they wanted to play in the final at home.",
      "\"For all of our squad, it's really important to give something to our fans this season. First of all, if you in the odds, it's hard for a club to lose four times in a row, so we can’t think in that way. I think we have to have a full squad, that is really important.",
      "\"In the moments, I'm just worried about the next game, to try to manage everything, not to get injuries for the final. But again, we need to win it. If we don't win it, it's nothing, it means nothing for us, so let's see.\""

      "Jason Wilcox is here, having run the City academy for around six years and spending more than a decade in various roles at the CFA.",
      "Now he's looking for the United youngsters to knock out the players he will know all to well at City.",
      "We're underway.",
      "Divin Mubama was the last City player back in the dressing room. He was working with two coaches right in front of the goal, testing his reflexes with close-range finishes right until the sprinklers came on,",
      "Michael Okeke, by the way, is given the number ten shirt so the holding midfielder/right-back looks like he will be in a more attacking role for the Blues.",
      "Ethan Williams makes his first appearance back for United after his loan at Cheltenham in League Two. He comes in to bolster an already-formidable attack.",
      "Kick off is nearly upon us.",
      "This is a derby that will be hotly contested as usual. City winger Ashton Muir told MEN Sport last week he was excited to face United because the derby is the best fixture possible in academy football.",
      "But it's a different kind of game as the sun is high in the sky and it's a glorious evening at the Etihad Campus. The stands should shield both goalkeepers but half of the pitch will be played in the sun so a test for the wide players.",
      "Both clubs are doing through attacking drills to get crosses into their strikers before the usual shooting drills. United and City both look up for it and why wouldn't they be?",
      "United first team coach Darren Fletcher is here tonight. It's not a surprise to see senior figures from both clubs pay close attention to this game given the mangnitude of it - but Flether is also likely here on a personal mission.",
      "His two sons are both involved for United, having previously represented City at younger age groups. The brothers keep in contact with City players but all friendships will be put to one side come kick off.",
      "Emile Heskey is likely to be watching as he joins Fletcher in having one son in the City starting XI and another on the bench. For fans of pointless stats - 12.5 per cent of the players involved today are Heskeys or Fletchers.",
      "Heskey Sr and Fletcher Sr faced each other nine times in their careers with Fletcher winning six of them including the 2010 EFL Cup final. Now it's time for their sons to take the reigns and all four are showing they have bright futures in the game.",
      "Ethan Wheatley is accomplished at under-21 level, so much so that he joined Walsall's League Two promotion push for a taste of senior football earlier this season. He's returned now and has scored three times in the last two rounds.",
      "Tyler Fletcher, formerly of the City academy, and James Scanlon will be threats, but Sam Mather isn't in the squad.",
      "Habeeb Ogunneye, Godwill Kukonk, Louis Jackson and Sam Murray have started all play-off rounds so far as part of a solid defence of their own.",
      "There's an injury crisis sweeping the City camp at the end of the season, so many of those who helped the Blues beat United back in September won't be available tonight.",
      "Farid Alfa-Ruprecht and Emilio Lawrence are injured, while Will Dickson and Jacob Wright have been out on loan so aren't available. Nico O'Reilly, who played that day, is now firmly a first team player.",
      "Jaden Heskey and Divin Mubama will carry the attacking responsibility with Justin Oboavwoduo a surprise absentee. Mubama has scored all three goals in these play-offs so far. Jaden's brother Reigan, a key winger for the under-19s, is involved on the bench.",
      "There's a settled defence these days with Jahmai Simpson-Pusey tasting first team action earlier in the campaign and the likes of Lakyle Samuel and Max Alleyne also highly-rated.",
      "A few changes from the last round, with Stephen Mfuni coming in from the under-18s to start along with Michael Okeke.",
      "Justin Oboavwoduo misses out completely with Divine Mukasa, Reigan Heskey and Matty Warhurst exciting reinforcements from the youth team.",
      "Ethan Wheatley, Ethan Williams and Seku Kone start for United with both Fletcher brothers involved.",
      "City starting XI:",
      "City substitutes:",
      "United starting XI:",
      "United substitutes:",
      "This one could go all the way with the two sides pretty evenly matched.",
      "If the scores are level after 90 minutes there will be extra time - something City have needed in both rounds so far in wins over Liverpool and Arsenal. If the rivals can still not be separated then it will be penalties to decide who reaches the final.",
      "When the sides met in their only league meeting back in September, City prevailed 3-1 thanks to goals from Farid-Alfa-Ruprecht, Jaden Heskey and Will Dickson - although Alfa-Ruprecht is injured for this one and Dickson has left on loan. United scorer that day, Ethan Wheatley, has spent time out on loan in League Two before returning for these play-offs, scoring three times in the two games.",
      "Well no-one just yet. City vs United is the first of the two last four ties taking place.",
      "The other is between Crystal Palace and Southampton and that tie is on Monday night at Selhurst Park with a 7pm kick off.",
      "Those two sides finished sixth and seventh in the Premier League 2 table with Palace thrashing Chelsea 6-0 in the last eight while the Saints overcame a Fulham side who finished second in the league standings.",
      "Jack Kingdon, Sam Murray and James Nolan will leave United when their contracts expire this summer.",
      "The MEN understands Kingdon, Murray and Nolan are out of contract at the end of the season and are set to depart after not being offered fresh terms at United.",
      "It is surprising that Kingdon is being allowed to leave after a strong first loan with Rochdale.",
      "Kingdon was close to joining Ineos-owned FC Lausanne Sport on loan in the January window - he joined Rochdale instead - and was hoping to impress Ruben Amorim during pre-season.",

That job lasted a year before he was headhunted by Manchester United, but he remains a respected figure at City for his work in implementing many of the systems that the first team are currently benefitting from.",

New City Sporting Director Hugo Viana was also watching as he takes a keen interest in the academy like predecessor Txiki Begiristain.",

      "Football heritage has a new meaning at Manchester United. Five cups, four more finals and the prospect of another trophy would represent a golden period for most clubs. United have crammed all of that into a doldrum decade.",
      "Their ninth European final will be more meaningful than their eighth, when supporters had to undergo more tests than a pupil during summer exams just to enter Gdansk in 2021. That Covid-impacted final was a hollow experience that served up 120 moribund minutes between United and Villarreal.",
      "United-Tottenham in a splendid Spanish city is the most consequential final in the Europa League era of what was once known as the Uefa Cup. Champions League qualification raises the stakes, never mind the prize pot of nearly £100million.",
      "\"The money is not the most important,\" Ruben Amorim insisted. \"Even the title to win as a coach, is that feeling that we can do good things, the feeling to give something to our fans. Particularly in this season.",
      "\"It’s not just playing Champions League next season, it’s that feeling that we can change things.\"",
      "Champions League qualification was not at the forefront of United fans' minds during their sole triumph in the Europa League. The 2017 final in Stockholm stirred raw emotions, held 48 hours after the barbaric Manchester Arena attack. On a sporting level, United completed the set by lifting a trophy whose silhouette did not previously appear on their honours' board.",
      "Tottenham have won the Uefa Cup twice. They have reached a Champions League final much more recently than United. As easy as some find it to deride Spurs, they are a bigger club than some that will finish in the top five of the Premier League and they boast European pedigree.",
      "United, for such a storied club, should have more European honours than the five they celebrated with their first tifo before the quarter-final tie with Lyon. We enter and exit the Old Trafford media centre via the Munich tunnel, a reminder not just of the tragedy that decimated the club in 1958 but the trailblazer that Sir Matt Busby and his Babes were when they embraced the European Cup competition.",
      "Leaving last night, a young fan asked about the final. It is a fascinating dynamic. Amorim admitted - with a chuckle - he and Ange Postecoglou are both \"struggling\". Spurs have won four and drawn one against United under Postecoglou.",
      "\"But they're bottlers,\" the lad wryly added. One cannot argue with that. Since Spurs beat Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final, they have lost finals in 2009, 2015, 2019 and 2021. 'Spursy' entered the football lexicon some time ago.",
      "Many are banking on United's mettle, disregarding their recent record against Spurs. \"Every game has its history,\" Amorim said. \"We lost the three last games, we can win this one, so if you look at the loss, we are closer to win than to lose.",
      "\"Both teams are going to play all or nothing. The position of the coach is quite similar. I know Ange has one more year (on his contract), it is different, the context, but we are struggling, both of us! I don’t know what is going to happen, it’s a good thing and a bad thing with this team, I never know!\"",
      "Postecoglou is 90 minutes away from making good on his pledge that \"I always win things in my second year\". The final is expected to be his last match in charge of Spurs. Looking from the outside, that inevitability seems to have emboldened him to ensure he leaves on a high Tottenham have not experienced in 17 years.",
      "Objectively, Spurs edge United in most areas. Guglielmo Vicario has been a better goalie than Andre Onana since they stepped foot on these shores from Europe's boot. Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie trump Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu. Micky van de Ven is one of the Premier League's best centre halves when fit. They have more technically rounded midfielders than United and Dominic Solanke is a more reliable marksman than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But we come back to Sir Alex Ferguson's most famous team talk: lads, it's Tottenham. United's Europa League record is daunting: 16 games, nine wins, five draws, no defeats and 35 goals scored. In the six knockout ties, United plundered 19 goals while their Premier League goal difference sank towards minus double figures.",
      "United also have greater depth. Athletic Bilbao petered out quicker than the pyrotechnic smoke after Amad, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo were introduced on Thursday night. Spurs are certain to be without Lucas Bergvall and James Maddison in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim should dismiss United's 3-0 humbling by Tottenham in September. Erik ten Hag was still clinging on and United's season was an extension of last season. Nothing was going to change until they changed the manager.",
      "The madcap League Cup tie in December is hardly relevant, either. United had Altay Bayindir, Antony and Christian Eriksen in their starting XI. Bayindir was not even the worst 'keeper on the pitch, with the cumbersome Fraser Forster up the other end.",
      "As for the 1-0 league loss in February, United were so depleted that Victor Lindelof was the bench's babysitter. Eight of the nine substitutes had never played for the club at the time. The only substitution Amorim made, a debut for Chido Obi, was in the 89th minute.",
      "It is a quirk of fate that United could win their second Europa League under a second Portuguese manager. Amorim and Jose Mourinho are the only United managers to reach a European final in their first season.",
      "Mourinho, of course, also managed Spurs and guided them to their last final in 2021. He was sacked six days before Spurs surrendered to City with Ryan Mason in the dugout for his first match in management.",
      "Of all his sackings, Mourinho told his former player John Obi Mikel that \"the most ridiculous one was a club that has an empty trophy room [and] sacks me two days before a final\". After City beat Spurs, Mourinho sent a friend an image of the 'Finalists 2020/21' keyring that Spurs had seriously flogged.",
      "That is football heritage."

      "Amad's impact before and after an ankle injury that sidelined him for two-and-a-half months suggests he will make the cut but Amorim has a delicate balancing act to juggle. He picked eight defensive players in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao and named an unchanged team on Thursday evening.",
      "These are the key selection dilemmas the United head coach has:",
      "Nobody has played more games for United this season than Alejandro Garnacho (55) and the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao was his 14th successive start. However, his place has come under threat with the return of Amad and the number seven shirt not weighing as heavily on Mason Mount.",
      "Amad has to start the final and has come on to play on the right wing and as the No.10 over the past week. The 22-year-old can adapt to either role effectively and it is more a question of where, rather than if, he will start in Bilbao.",
      "Mount has started in a Champions League and European Championship final (albeit during the fake football of the Covid-19 pandemic) and he has the momentum. Yet he last completed 90 minutes in November 2023.",
      "Leny Yoro has had his best spell for United since the March internationals and Harry Maguire, yet to start a final for the club, is a shoo-in in the back three. The identity of the third could be uncertain until as late as next week.",
      "Victor Lindelof was unconvincing in both legs against Athletic Bilbao and these are his final weeks as a United player. Matthijs de Ligt has one match at Chelsea next Friday to prove his fitness and that could be too late in the day come the final. De Ligt has started only twice in the last six weeks.",
      "Ayden Heaven did individual work at Carrington in midweek but is very much an outside bet, having started only four career games and played 90 minutes once. Luke Shaw is an option but he struggled as a starter at Bournemouth and Brentford and the intensity in the final is bound to be more Premier League than Europa League.",
      "Only four United players have played in at least 50 games this season and Noussair Mazraoui is one of them. He seems assured of a start against Spurs, though Amorim said the Moroccan is currently lacking energy. A conservative role in the back three may be the best use of Mazraoui on May 21.",
      "Amorim is hopeful Diogo Dalot can be available for the final but, like De Ligt, he will have one game at Chelsea to prove his fitness. People at the club have spoken optimistically that Dalot will recover from a calf injury to play again this season and he was at Old Trafford for the Athletic tie.",
      "Amad is a credible alternative and would provide a better balance between defence and attack, otherwise Amorim could overload the starting XI with defensive players again. That sent out the wrong message against Athletic at Old Trafford and United only took them to the cleaners after attack-minded substitutions.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is a non-starter as he will be on the left. Mazraoui's workload could convince Amorim that he is better served in defence.",
      "Denzel Dumfries' excursions against Barcelona in Inter Milan's Champions League semi-final epics are a reminder of the endurance required of a winger in a back-three formation, so Amad or Dalot are the forward-thinking options."

      "It has been easy to pick apart Manchester United's recruitment mistakes in recent years, but occasionally, they get things right. As Ruben Amorim plots his Old Trafford rebuild, he has at least a couple of players who can signpost a brighter future.",
      "Despite their success in the Europa League this season, United's route back to the top is not easy. Their base camp is 15th after a desperate domestic season. Yet there are signs of promise and hope for years to come.",
      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "After failing to start any of Manchester United's opening 22 Premier League games this season, it was clear Antony had to be offloaded before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Following several months worth of speculation surrounding his future, the Brazilian international was given an escape route with just over a week of the window remaining, joining Real Betis.",
      "He joined the Spanish outfit on a loan deal until the end of the season, offering him the opportunity to get his career back on track after failing to make his mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Exactly 15 weeks since the deal was completed, Antony has grasped the opportunity with both hands and made the most of it.",
      "His first 21 appearances for Betis have seen him score eight goals and register five assists, meaning his tally of 13 direct goal contributions is only four fewer than what he has produced in 96 appearances for United.",
      "His latest strike in green and white saw him score past former United teammate David de Gea for the second time in a week, with his excellent free-kick on Thursday night helping Betis draw 2-2 with Fiorentina in the second leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final.",
      "After uncharacteristically scoring with his right foot in the first leg, his efforts helped Betis seal a 4-3 aggregate victory. It means they will now face Chelsea in the final at the end of May.",
      "As well as scoring Betis' opener in Italy, he also produced the assist for Abde Ezzalzouli's extra-time equaliser that ultimately sealed the tie in Betis' favour.",
      "Crying during both the full-time celebrations and a post-match interview, Antony said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here.",
      "\"I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "The aim of Antony's temporary switch to the Seville-based club was to try and develop a situation that would benefit both him and United. The former Ajax man, who joined the Reds in September 2022 for £86.3million, needed to get out of Old Trafford to get regular minutes under his belt and find the true version of himself.",
      "Scoring seven goals and registering five assists in 21 games, the winger has created a market for himself ahead of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Betis bosses have waxed lyrical about the winger throughout his time at the club and chief executive Ramon Alarcon confirmed in midweek they would like to extend his stay at the club by a further year, but conceded United will hold all the cards on any decision that is made.",
      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they've seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.\"",
      "Signed for £86.3m less than three years ago, it goes without saying that United paid over the odds, meaning they have no chance of recouping a fee anywhere close to what they paid.",
      "United, under profit and sustainability rules [PSR], will have to bank £32.52m to avoid a loss on him. His current form has created a market for him, meaning his stock is much higher than it was in January, but the aforementioned price tag could still put prospective suitors off.",
      "Another loan exit, this time for a full season, could be United's best chance of offloading Antony again this summer. A season-long loan deal with an option to turn it into a permanent deal at the end of it feels as though that could be the most likely type of deal to be struck.",
      "Whatever happens in the summer, Antony deserves credit for making his mark at Betis in the way he has. La Liga is not as physical as the Premier League and his performances have been much more satisfying to watch.",
      "United will have to hold their hands up and accept they misjudged Erik ten Hag's recommendation to bring him to Old Trafford, but they know they have a £32.5m target to keep in mind."

      "Arsenal fans may fume at the prospect of their team giving Liverpool a guard of honour at Anfield this weekend, but Sir Alex Ferguson is one who supports the tradition.",
      "The north Londoners were hot on the heels of the Reds for the entirety of 2024/25, before faltering in the latter stages of the campaign and painfully watching their rivals claim the Premier League title with four games to spare. And as a result, it goes without saying that celebrating their peers' achievements may not be atop the list of Arsenal's things they want to do.",
      "Instead, Mikel Arteta and his side will much prefer to focus on securing a second-place finish in the Premier League, with the threat of drifting down the table still very real.",
      "For context, three points separate the side from third-place Manchester City, while just seven keep them from seventh-placed Aston Villa with three games left to play.",
      "And while the squad will hope to hit the ground running when they visit Anfield on Sunday, they will first be expected to give Liverpool a guard of honour in recognition of their achievements. In no way new to the world of football, Brendan Rodgers has also recalled how Ferguson once swallowed his pride to congratulate Chelsea in similar fashion.",
      "Manchester United famously gave Jose Mourinho's Chelsea the honour two decades ago when the 'Special One' guided the Lions to a Premier League title.",
      "Rodgers, who was working as a coach with Chelsea at the time, also explained that it was Ferguson who initiated the decision, reports the Mirror.",
      "He said: \"I can never forget when I was at Chelsea as a young coach and, in that first season that Jose was in, they won the title.",
      "\"I remember going to Old Trafford to watch the game that evening and I'm sure the Man United players didn't want to do it but I'm sure Fergie insisted they did it.",
      "\"That must have been really, really difficult but it showed you the class of Sir Alex and it showed you the humility of him that another competitor came in and took the title, but it was also sporting that they did that, but also can provide you with great motivation going forward.\"",
      "While the display isn't an enforced rule per se, it comes as a class-act of tradition to show respect.",
      "However, there have been certain instances of reluctance, especially when sides are direct rivals of one another.",
      "While Liverpool will lavish in their 20th overall top flight title, and enjoy their final three games as a victory circuit, Arsenal have the task of playing to the final whistle of the season.",
      "The Gunners will need wins over Liverpool, Newcastle United, and Southampton to ensure they finish as runners-up, as the Cityzens plan to overtake stiff competition in the standings and make up for an off-kilter season of their own."

      "United are in the Europa League final after beating Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at Old Trafford. It means the 2024/25 season stays alive with less than two weeks until the showdown in Bilbao with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Off the pitch, United are being linked with several potential signings ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "In the last 24 hours, reports have been pointing towards a major overhaul of United's attack. Viktor Gyokeres remains a target, with updates on Matheus Cunha, Liam Delap and Victor Osimhen all emerging.",
      "New players continue to be linked with a move to United with Paris Saint-Germain's Goncalo Ramos the latest number nine. Elsewhere, players continue to be linked with a move away from the club with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund all having interest elsewhere.",
      "ports have emerged, once again, claiming that Alejandro Garnacho may be on the move before the start of next season.",
      "There has been reports suggesting that Bruno Fernandes could come under the watchful glare of the Saudi Pro League, as well as the future of Antony who has been in fine form for Real Betis.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news in our live blog below;",
      "Real Betis president Angel Haro has confirmed the Spanish club will hold talks with Manchester United about the prospect of extending Antony's loan spell - but has warned the situation is \"very, very complicated\".",
      "\"Keeping Antony as our own is very, very complicated,\" he said. \"We'll have a meeting with Manchester United to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player.",
      "\"It's about seeing the willingness of the player and Manchester United. The first filter is set by Manchester, and then the negotiation of the player would come, but that’s a long way off.",
      "\"Besides, the player is now fully engaged, wanting to win a title with Betis. When the time comes and the season ends, he'll be able to do his part if this option opens up.\"",
      "Manchester United teenager Victor Musa has reportedly been compared to Barcelona star Lamine Yamal and Athletic Bilbao are said to be interested in signing him.",
      "AS claim that he is on Bilbao’s radar but that his dream is to play at senior level for United. Musa has previously represented Spain and England at youth level, and it is also claimed that the senior Spanish national team do not want to miss out on him.",
      "The report adds that Musa is viewed as United's answer to Yamal in Spain. Yamal, 17, has taken European football by storm since bursting onto the scene at Barcelona in 2023 and played a pivotal role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph.",
      "Reds boss Ruben Amorim has already displayed his willingness to hand youth a chance since replacing Erik ten Hag as head coach in November. The former Sporting head coach has called up Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson as part of Europa League-focused rotation in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United have a strong chance of winning the Europa League final against Tottenham, despite their record against the North London side in recent years.",
      "\"I am not saying they will win it, but history tells me they have a great chance of winning it. We know Tottenham have beaten them three times and Tottenham are a really good team, I like Tottenham. If they watch that first 70 minutes they will think 'we have got a right chance here'.",
      "\"But for some reason the history of this club, it's almost like Real Madrid at times. When they aren't playing that well but they can still go on and win European cups. I just feel the odds are slightly in Man United's favour, although Tottenham are a good side.\"",
      "Brazilian outlet Trivela reports that uncertainty continues to surround Casemiro’s future.",
      "According to the report, Man United have yet to inform the midfielder’s representatives whether he is part of their plans for the 2025/26 season, with Casemiro said to be 'waiting for a signal' from the club.",
      "Trivela state: \"In this scenario, United find themselves in a tough spot. The club needs to decide as soon as possible whether they want to count on the midfielder to activate the contract renewal clause. Otherwise, the likelihood is that Ruben Amorim will lose a starter for a price well below his value to the team.\"",
      "Man United continue to work behind the scenes to secure an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein claims that an offer has been made but an agreement is yet to be struck between parties.",
      "In addition, discussions are continuing to take place though not a great deal can happen before the season ends. With that said, it's thought the Reds will look to get personal terms in place in the meantime.",
      "Gary Neville has urged Manchester United to go out and sign Inter Milan's right wing-back Denzel Dumfries to fit into Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.",
      "Dumfries, who was linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer - and before that even - is one of the very best wing-backs in European football and showed exactly what he is capable of in the Champions League semi-final. Of Inter's seven goals against Barcelona in the semi-final, he scored two and created three.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Neville said: \"Do you know what I kept thinking during the game? With the way Man United are playing with a back five and wing-backs under Ruben Amorim, I was thinking about that right wing-back.",
      "\"I was thinking about Dumfries for United. I would like to see him in the Premier League, wouldn't you? How good was he? He was unbelievable. He's so good, so good.\"",
      "There’s been a positive development in United’s pursuit of a new striker after Liam Delap reportedly emerged as their top target.",
      "According to The Athletic, the necessary funds to land him are already in place, though the deal is expected to take some time to finalise.",
      "This delay is attributed to strong competition for Delap’s signature, as the player has yet to decide on his preferred destination.",
      "Manchester United will take all of their first-team squad members on their post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "United are playing two matches on May 28 and 30 after their final Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa in a trip that they are expected to pocket around £8million from.",
      "\"Yes, I was consulted,\" Amorim said. \"And again, I already spoke about that. We cannot say nothing after this season.",
      "\"So we need to help the club, because the club wins some money. We are going to connect with our fans around the world and that is important, especially when we lose and we disappoint our supporters during this tough season. So I think it's the least we can do.",
      "\"And we are going to take all the team, young kids also, we'll have the staff there. We have a lot of changes in the staff, so we are trying to build something as a family. I think it's also a good thing.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has arranged a meeting with Matheus Cunha's representatives over a potential move to the club, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "United remain the favourites for the forward after reports that the Brazilian was sold on Ruben Amorim's project. No deal has been agreed yet as his release clause doesn't become active until the end of the season.",
      "Man United have been labelled as a serious contender in the race to sign Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "The defender is leaving the German club at the end of his contract and accordin got CF Bayern Insider, United are one team to watch in the race. Christian Falk has also added that Bayern Munich and Barcelona are in the race.",
      "“They (Bayern)’re discussing a move for Jonathan Tah and have made contact through the Leverkusen defender’s agent, Pini Zahavi. Zahavi now has to clarify whether or not there is an opportunity for Barcelona to register him. If not, he will be on the market again.",
      "“Many clubs are following Jonathan Tah, including Premier League sides. Still, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Bayern Munich had an agreement in the pipeline last summer, and now he’s set to become a free agent. It would be easier to bring him in now, and Bayern have made it clear that they need a new centre-back with Eric Dier set to join Monaco this summer. So Bayern Munich will look to try and get him.",
      "“Manchester United, who have been linked with Tah, is always going to be a serious competitor. I think Jonathan Tah would like to have an experience in the Premier League. There aren’t so many clubs searching in this position, so, of course, United is an opportunity.”",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Goncalo Ramos, according to reports.",
      "Ramos isn't a player the potential Champions League winners are looking to sell, but Caught Offside have claimed growing interest means an exit isn't ruled out.",

      "\"I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "\"Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system. I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.\"",

Stockport is definitely on the up and the club is on the up at the same time.\"",

      "\"Promotion would be amazing,\" he added. \"It would mean so much. Football is so big in Iceland and if you make it abroad then everyone knows you.\"",

      "He appears to have no future at Old Trafford, with a permanent exit on the cards this summer. Rashford may have played his last game at Villa as he is currently injured and cannot play against United on the final day of the campaign.",
      "The England international is believed to be chasing a move to long-time admirers Barcelona. Spanish outfit Mundo Deportivo reports that Rashford is now being represented by Zahavi, the agent of Barca head coach Hansi Flick and star striker Robert Lewandowski, which could potentially help pave the way to the move to the Catalans.",

      "Yoro is growing in confidence as a United player after his £52million summer move from Lille. In recent weeks, his quality on the ball has become more noticeable, not just in terms of his passing but also his marauding forward runs from a position in the back three.",
      "That Yoro is occasionally beginning to resemble Ferdinand - a graceful centre-back who made 455 appearances for the club - is perhaps no surprise, given that the latter has become something of a mentor to the 19-year-old, who has played just 30 games for United.",
      "The teenager takes advice from his manager but is close to Ferdinand. The 46-year-old spoke to the Frenchman when he was close to joining United, and they have remained in touch, speaking not only on camera for an interview but also off-screen as Yoro tries to develop his game.",
      "\"I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio and not always in front of the cameras,\" said Yoro. \"Sometimes they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, you need to take it. I try to do my best and what they tell me to do.\"",
      "Social media was awash with comparisons between Yoro and Ferdinand after his starring role in the 4-1 win against Athletic Bilbao, a result that booked United a spot in the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "He is also starting to be compared to some other outstanding defenders in United's recent past, and he has undoubtedly been a bright spot in what has been a difficult campaign for the club.",
      "\"Of course, I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies, so when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, Vidic, Varane you want to achieve the same things as them, stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender,\" he said.",
      "\"When they compare me to them, it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this. I’m trying to be the best I can.",
      "\"When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this [history] - this is a club of trophies. I think it will be important to think about this, we’re Manchester United and need to win trophies.",
      "\"I’m still a young player, but on the pitch, this means nothing. When you join a big club like Man United you have to settle quickly because the fans are waiting for you, even with a big transfer like I had. So yeah, it was important to settle really quickly.\"",
      "Yoro's start to life at Old Trafford was halted by a metatarsal injury he suffered in just his second pre-season game. He didn't start a game until December but is now becoming a regular presence in the back three.",
      "\"It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned,\" he said. \"But now I’m 100 per cent, I start to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season.\""

The 26-year-old rounded off the scoring in the 7-1 aggregate triumph with a perfectly-clipped lob from 40 yards with goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala outside the area.",

The attacking midfielder has now scored three goals in two games and is competing for a place in United's Europa League final XI as one of the two playmakers in the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 formation.",

When you look at the other guys on the bench are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount do everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He’s a really good player and both goals are really good goals, so I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, the teammates were so happy for him.",
      "\"Was a good result. I think if you look at both games was so much tougher than if you just look to the result. We have so many weaknesses, you can understand that but we are fighting and we deserve if you look at two games, to be in the final.",

      "Man Utd’s rebuild under Ruben Amorim is gathering pace, but one former England international believes their problems go far beyond any one signing, no matter how talented.",
      "Chris Waddle has warned Man Utd must brace themselves for a long-term rebuild under Amorim and avoid falling back into short-term fixes as he attempts to repair an age",
      "“Manchester United have an ageing squad,” he said.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, who has a massive job on his hands, has brought a lot of young players through. They have to keep their hands off the panic button this summer. They need to give him time, and there are players there that he needs to move on.”",
      "Waddle also stressed that United’s biggest challenge this summer might not be who they bring in, but who they can afford to get off the books.",
      "“They need a big investment,” he continued.",
      "“Four or five players need to come in, but the even bigger challenge will be getting rid of some. They’re on massive wages. The clubs that will want them won’t have the financial muscle United do, and it’ll be tough to sell them on to Italy or Spain.”",
      "Amorim is expected to be backed in the transfer market this summer as Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe look to reshape the first team and staff structure behind the scenes. But patience, Waddle thinks, will be just as important as new signings.",
      "“They lost 4-3 to Brentford, but until Amorim gets his own team together, it’s too early to judge. I think the top six is still a massive challenge for United next season. They need two or three years with Amorim in charge. They have to stop changing managers.”",
      "Still, the club is moving early to secure what could be their first major incoming of the Amorim era – a dynamic, versatile forward who has been one of the standout attacking players outside the traditional top six this season.",
      "Sources close to the deal, such as transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, indicate United are in advanced talks with Wolves over a move for Matheus Cunha, with negotiations centring around a fee in excess of £50 million.",
      "Waddle, while full of praise for the Brazilian’s ability, was quick to temper the hype.",
      "“Cunha is a fantastic footballer. He can be temperamental, but perhaps United would be the making of him,” he said. “You can’t be mardy at a club like that — the fans will let you know.”",
      "Cunha, 25, has scored 15 Premier League goals this season for Wolves and is widely viewed as ready for a step up. Waddle believes the move could be transformative if the player embraces the pressure.",
      "“He probably thinks he’s at the stage when he should be at a club like United. Wolves are a big club, but Cunha will be looking for another level up.",
      "“He’s got a huge opportunity here. If he’s one of the players to turn United around and [get them] challenging again, he could be like Eric Cantona, the man who changed United.”",

      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim drop the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "Transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Goalkeeper is not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",

      "“We just have to sign the new contract. But it’s up to the club.”",
      "United are thought to be near the front of the queue to pounce on the 26-year-old if a new contract isn’t forthcoming.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘From Paris, for now, they remain silent about a possible exit, but the growing interest of the ‘red devils’ and other European clubs could accelerate events. If PSG fails to renew its star goalkeeper, the next summer market could be decisive for its future. Donnarumma, with an already consolidated career and room for growth, is facing a possible new challenge away from Ligue 1.’",

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Manchester United secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils had a 3-0 lead going into the second leg but it was a tense atmosphere for much of the second leg after Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half strike gave Athletic Club hope of a comeback.",
      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",

      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",
      "“Lovely. It was very nice to score a scrappy goal. I am very glad Amad played the ball. What a player. Great player to have back in the team. Them two players are extremely talented, so we are very glad to have them both back [Amad and Mount].”",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has performed an ‘incredible U-turn’ on one Manchester United star who could ‘see out his career’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United should be celebrating reaching a Europa League final, but Ruben Amorim was ‘forced’ to wear a plaster ‘just months’ after getting angry.",
      "Ruben Amorim has responded to Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal legend called for a rule change which would impact Manchester United.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has found it “strange” to watch Ruben Amorim’s side play a different formation to the Under-21 side.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the youngest Manchester United starting XI in Premier League history to prepare for a crucial European game. How mid-2000s of him.",

      "Garnacho started the second leg of United’s Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club but was hooked on the hour mark with the Red Devils trailing 1-0 on the night, before a brilliant brace from Mason Mount and goals from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund saw them storm back and claim a 7-1 aggregate win to set up a final with Tottenham.",
      "The 20-year-old has struggled through much of this campaign as he’s struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s system, which sees him play a more central role in a 3-4-3 formation.",
      "He’s been heavily linked with an exit as a result and United are thought to be ready to listen to offers of £65m for the Argentina international, with Chelsea among those most interested in signing him.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "Fellow former United midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: “I think he’s really special and he’s a man for the big moments. He can deal with the pressure at this club.",
      "“The problem is Ruben Amorim’s system suits No. 10s but he’s better on the wings running at people, he’s probably United’s best player at that.",
      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "Paul Scholes has two concerns over the imminent Man Utd signing and claims nothing can save what has been a “disaster” of a season for the club.",
      "Garnacho leaving Man Utd this summer is “highly possible” according to David Ornstein, who named six other “plausible” exits and two who “will leave the wage bill”."

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "And yet, for all that disparity, any away side has a bit of hope at Old Trafford these days. Bilbao gave it a go. The issue? Finishing. Or lack of it.",

      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund thought he’d rounded it off with a tap-in, but the cherry was reserved for Mount’s second – and third in two games – a left-footed effort from somewhere near Salford. Listen, fair play.",
      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",

      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",

      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",

      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",

The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",

      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",

      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",

      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "In 2014, Neville and fellow Class of ’92 members Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt bought non-league side Salford City as part of a consortium which included businessman Peter Lim.",
      "Neville and Co. oversaw a rapid rise as Salford City earned four promotions in five years to reach League Two, but the club has stagnated in recent seasons.",
      "Salford City have just finished their sixth-straight season in League Two and narrowly missed out on the play-offs, finishing eighth in the table.",
      "Wrexham have stolen their thunder in recent years as the League Two outfit have been mocked for their huge spend on transfers failing to pay off and the hierarchy rashly sacking managers.",
      "READ: Mikel Arteta mid-table in Premier League manager rankings topped by staggering Slot",
      "Now, Salford chiefs have recognised that changes are necessary, with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing Neville and Beckham are part of a ‘new consortium’ in control of the club.",
      "His report confirms Butt, Giggs, Neville and Scholes have ‘relinquished their stakes, but will continue to occupy various positions at Moor Lane’.",
      "It is noted that Neville and Beckham have been ‘seeking investment partners’ since Lim’s exit from Salford City in 2024 and they ‘plan on lifting the club to new heights’ amid their ‘commitment to injecting significant funds’.",

      "After ‘considering multi-club models and a direct owner’, Neville and Beckham ‘decided to join forces with Declan Kelly, founder of U.S.-based advisory firm Consello, and Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association’, who ‘will co-chair Salford’s board of directors’.",
      "Regarding Salford City’s Championship plans, the report adds:",
      "‘The collective are believed to have raised around $15-20million [approx £15m at most] to boost Salford’s sporting and infrastructural ambitions over the next five years. Inside that timeframe they are targeting promotion to the Championship.",
      "‘Each member will hold a 5 per cent or 10 per cent stake, totalling at 80 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent has been earmarked for additional partners.",
      "‘None of them will have day-to-day involvement — interviews are taking place to appoint a chief executive and that person will drive matters on the ground — but their influence is set to be felt across the operation.’",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",

      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho."

      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "“I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,” Garnancho explained. “But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "“Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",

      "“I’m not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here, he was a different footballer, [they were] a different type of games,” he said, at Wednesday’s press conference. “I just try to help the team and try to win games.",
      "“Obviously, yeah, on missed chances and things like this, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus [Hojlund] and all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and we will try to do better.”",
      "United won their first leg 3-0 in Bilbao and have a great chance of reaching the Europa League final and Garnacho says he’s working hard with Hojlund – who’s been particularly poor in front of goal this season – to improve their output.",
      "“I speak with him a lot. We try to help each other,” he added. “Sometimes, from this side, it’s difficult but we try hard, try harder every game to try to score more of these chances, and the team will improve if we score more goals.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",
      "Europa League glory to end the infamous trophy drought and qualify for the Champions League, despite a potential club-record Premier League low finish, would be a successful season for Spurs.Declan Olley"

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",

      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",

      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",

      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",
      "Both clubs are in need of a reset. Another rebuild. A season of consolidation.",
      "Not having a Champions League campaign - and at least eight league-phase matches to negotiate - wouldn't be a bad thing.",
      "If Amorim and whoever oversees Spurs want to keep their jobs next season, the bread and butter of the Premier League will dictate matters in that regard.",
      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Report as two goals from Mason Mount saw Man Utd come from a goal down on the night to beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final at Old Trafford; United will play Tottenham in Bilbao",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 06:09, UK",
      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League final as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",
      "The result sets up an all-English final in Bilbao on May 21 following Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final. A difficult season for both Premier League clubs will end with one of them securing a Champions League spot next season.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (5), Lindelof (5), Maguire (5), Yoro (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (8), Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Garnacho (5), Fernandes (7), Hojlund (6).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (9), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Amass (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nAthletic Club: Agirrezabala (5), Gorosabel (6), Yeray Alvarez (6), Unai Nunez (6), Berechiche (6), Ruiz De Galarreta (6), Jaureguizar (7), Alvaro Djalo (6), Gomez (7), Berenguer (7), Sannadi (6).\n\n\nSubs:De Marcos (5), Prados (n/a), Olabarrieta (5), Guruzeta (5), Vesga Arruti (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Mason Mount.",
      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable. For me personally, my first goals at Old Trafford. Special night, one I have been waiting a long time for. We want to go to Bilbao and finish strong now.\"",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Aston Villa are a cracking bet to beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fulham have had a strange season.",
      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion.",
      "He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",
      "He's in the shop window too, isn't he? Strikers don't come more motivated when trying to play for a next contract so he's going to be doing his upmost to grab the limelight.",
      "\"Who cares if we've struggled in the league?\" beamed Ange Postecoglou after going to the Arctic Circle and getting the job done in impressive fashion on Thursday night. Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",

      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",

      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
