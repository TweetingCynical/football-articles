      "Benjamin Sesko has issued a rallying cry to Manchester United fans after scoring in the win over Sunderland. Sesko scored the second goal of the day for United in their 2-0 triumph over the Black Cats in Saturday's Premier League clash.",
      "Mason Mount opened the scoring at Old Trafford, helping Ruben Amorim's squad bounce back from their loss to Brentford the previous weekend. The Red Devils will now head into the international break with a spring in their step following their victory over Sunderland.",
      "Many members of the United squad, including Sesko, will join their national teams for the next two weeks before regrouping at Carrington for the showdown against Liverpool in the Premier League later this month. Sesko is set to represent Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Switzerland in the coming weeks.",
      "After his standout performance against Sunderland, the forward shared a message with his 1.5 million Instagram followers.",
      "\"What a feeling! A goal at the Stretford End and three points to go with it,\" Sesko wrote on Instagram. \"Let’s build on this. Hungry for more!\"",
      "Since his summer move from RB Leipzig, Sesko has scored two goals for United, both in the last two matches against Brentford and Sunderland. The 22-year-old will now be keen to keep up this momentum when United take on Liverpool in their next match after the international break.",
      "Sesko also elaborated on the emotions he felt after scoring his first Old Trafford goal for United. Despite the goal being a personal landmark for the striker, Sesko still pointed to the importance of the team getting all three points in a crucial Premier League fixture.",
      "\"Amazing, the atmosphere after the goal is something I've dreamed about always. Hopefully I can carry on this way,\" said Sesko, via BBC Sport.",
      "\"Definitely important for me. In general for the team it's even more important. When you have a lead like that it's easy to get comfortable.",
      "\"We are training every single week, we are trying to know where to be in every situation. We're getting better and better.\"",

      "Referees’ chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that they were the victims of a big mistake in their defeat by Brentford last weekend. United lost 3-1 in west London in a result which piled pressure onto Ruben Amorim, but the club felt hard done by.",
      "Bruno Fernandes saw his penalty saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered them a route back into the game. Collins was bailed out by his goalkeeper and got lucky twice as he escaped a red card for pulling back the United forward inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson opted against the dismissal and his decision was upheld by VAR, with a statement released to explain the reasoning. “The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back,” it read. “VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins – and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.”",
      "That decision was questioned by many and had an obvious impact on the game, with Brentford keeping 11 players on the pitch and going on to score again. United felt aggrieved and The Daily Mail says that they wrote to the Professional Game Match Officials for an explanation.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox got a response from PGMO chief Webb, who accepted that Pawson and the VAR had made a mistake and Collins should have seen red. It is not the first time that Webb has conceded a high-profile error this season and ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey was stunned at this one.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball. It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "\"It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.”",
      "Webb also came out this week to defend the decision to overturn Arsenal’s penalty against Newcastle when Viktor Gyokeres clashed with Nick Pope. “The VAR checks the penalty,” Webb explained on Premier League's Match Officials Mic'd Up show.",
      "\"When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going in. That hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee.”",

      "Senne Lammens made a bright start to his Manchester United career this weekend, but as history shows, a strong debut doesn't always guarantee a permanent spot in the first team. This is a lesson that former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson learned the hard way.",
      "After a sparkling debut for the club in a League Cup match against Luton back in 2020, Henderson was tipped for big things. Many, including then-boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, saw him not only as United's future No. 1, but also England's. However, neither of these predictions came true.",
      "With David de Gea firmly cemented as first-choice keeper, Henderson found chances hard to come by. He later hinted that promises had been broken and admitted that his patience at Old Trafford \"wasted\" a significant part of his career.",
      "After joining United's academy in 2011, Henderson took his first steps into senior football on loan at Stockport County. His breakthrough, however, came at Sheffield United, where his standout performances in the club's 2019/20 Premier League campaign solidified his reputation as one of England's most promising talents.",
      "Interest in Henderson was high at the end of the season, but he chose to stay at United after reportedly being told he'd be the first choice in a year's time.",
      "Things initially started brightly. After making what Henderson described as a \"dream\" debut for the club, he went on to make 26 appearances in all competitions in 2020/21.",
      "\"I dreamt about this my whole life!\" Henderson wrote on social media after his first appearance in a United shirt. \"Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!\"",
      "Yet when the 2021/22 campaign got underway, it became obvious that De Gea wasn't going anywhere and would retain his status as first choice - leaving Henderson understandably disappointed.",
      "\"To sit there and waste 12 months is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming,\" he told talkSPORT in 2022. \"I turned so many good loans down last summer for that reason [being promised No.1 spot], and they wouldn't let me go. It was frustrating.\"",
      "Henderson decided to take control of his own destiny, hastily arranging a temporary switch to Nottingham Forest ahead of new boss Erik ten Hag's summer 2022 arrival. \"I didn't really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew he'd probably want to keep me,\" Henderson explained.",
      "\"So I tried to do it all before I left for the season, I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football. I don't want to be here playing second fiddle. And it panned out so I was almost gone before the manager came in the door and I haven't spoken to him since.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "At the City Ground, Henderson finally secured the regular minutes he'd been desperate for. However, an untimely thigh problem sidelined him for the second half of the campaign, disrupting the progress he'd at last begun to make.",
      "After a permanent switch to Crystal Palace in 2023, he initially shared goalkeeping duties with Sam Johnstone. However, by the 2024/25 campaign, Henderson had truly made his mark - securing his spot as Palace's top-choice goalkeeper.",
      "He ended the season on the highest of notes, saving a penalty in Palace's stunning 1-0 triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Now, he stands as a pivotal figure in the squad as the club embarks on its maiden European journey in the Conference League this season.",
      "United must be ruing their decision to let Henderson leave, at least to some degree. The man who was blocking his path, David de Gea, left the same summer he did, and De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, endured a torrid two-year spell between the sticks before being loaned out to Trabzonspor last month.",
      "In the weeks since, Altay Bayindir has been given the task of filling the void, with varying degrees of success. However, there is a glimmer of hope. Summer recruit Lammens made a promising impression during Saturday's 2-0 victory over Sunderland, pulling off a couple of key saves to secure United's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "The Belgian also stood out for his composure, both on the ball and when facing shots, and seems well on his way to establishing himself as United's No. 1. But as Henderson's cautionary tale has shown us, a positive start doesn't guarantee anything.",

      "In recent years, Manchester United have seen more seasoned professionals than Altay Bayindir allow their emotions to get the better of them when they are replaced in the starting line-up. Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, was livid after being substituted by Erik ten Hag.",
      "More recently, Alejandro Garnacho voiced his frustrations before and after the Europa League final as he made little more than a cameo appearance in Bilbao. Bayindir was not at his sparkling best against Brentford last weekend.",
      "He should have perhaps done better for the second goal. However, he will have sat on the bench last season watching Andre Onana put in worse performances and keep his place in the squad.",
      "And yet on Saturday, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his debut following his deadline day switch from Royal Antwerp. Undoubtedly, this would have been a bitter blow for the Turkish goalkeeper, who would have hoped to have made the No.1 position his own in the wake of Onana's exit.",
      "And yet, instead of dwelling on the issue, Bayindir showed his maturity and celebrated with his teammate after he made a solid first appearance for United. This is exactly what the Reds need now more than ever.",
      "Yes, there has been a lack of quality at times under Amorim but team spirit has been clear for all to see. Fortunately, what we saw from Bayindir is a player who will not sulk and mope around the club because he has missed out on a start.",
      "It seems he's genuinely pleased for Lammens and his fellow players, as evidenced by his post-match social media activity. This surely contributes to a more positive vibe in the changing room.",
      "Naturally, you wouldn't want to lose that competitive drive and the will to fight for your place in the team. From Amorim's point of view, he'll be hopeful he sees this squad take inspiration from Bayindir and Lammens, striking the right balance between competitiveness and team unity.",

      "Wayne Rooney joked that Michael Owen was \"clearly\" a better footballer than he was at 17 in the most recent edition of Match of the Day. The Manchester United legend has been embroiled in a debate with the Liverpool icon as of late over who held more talent in their breakthrough year.",
      "The debate initially kicked off when Owen told the Rio Ferdinand podcast: \"I saw Wazza got asked who was the best out of us at the age of 17 or 18. And I did smile,\" before adding: \"The only person you could possibly compare me to in our country is Wayne Rooney.\"",
      "Rooney, meanwhile, responded to the striker's take by explaining: \"I think his comments are fair. Of course, he's going to back himself. I'd back myself.",
      "\"But, I'd never judge myself against Michael Owen because he's someone I actually looked up to and had the pleasure of playing alongside.\"",
      "After the nation fiercely debated who was the better player, it appears as though Rooney has now settled the argument once and for all. Speaking on Match of the Day on Saturday evening alongside Rooney and Alan Shearer, in the wake of Bukayo Saka achieving his 100th goal involvement during Arsenal's 2-0 win over West Ham, Gabby Logan pulled up a chart of the players who have achieved the same feat as well as how many games it took them to do so.",
      "The presenter added: \"You’re just behind Michael Owen, he’s top of the pops there, for players with 100 Premier League goal involvements and how few games they’ve got there - 153 for Michael, 187 for you, 212 for Bukayo.\"",
      "To which, Rooney replied: \"Yeah, I think that clearly shows that Michael was a better player than I was at that age,\" before erupting with laughter. He then added: \"But no, I think for Saka, he’s such an important player for Arsenal and for England.",
      "\"I think over the last three or four years, he’s probably been Arsenal’s most important player. He’s had a few injuries which have affected…them numbers would even better if that weren’t the case I believe. But yeah, he’s such an incredible player.\"",
      "Declan Rice opened the scoring against his old club on Saturday afternoon with a well-placed strike past Alphonse Areola into the top left corner with 38 minutes played. Saka then doubled Arsenal's lead in the second-half, coolly converting from the spot after Jurrien Timber was brought down in the West Ham box.",
      "Both Rooney and Owen enjoyed incredible playing careers in the Premier League. Rooney currently sits third in the Premier League's tally of all-time top scorers with 208 goals to his name with Everton and Manchester United, with Shearer and Harry Kane ahead of him with 260 and 213 respectively.",
      "Owen, meanwhile, failed to make it into the top 10, with 150 goals across his incredible career with Liverpool, Newcastle United, Manchester United, and Stoke City.",

      "Marcus Rashford is rapidly closing in on a personal milestone he set himself for his loan stint at Barcelona. The England winger secured his switch to Spain from Manchester United over the summer after finding himself frozen out by Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "Raphinha and Lamine Yamal predictably limited Rashford to brief substitute appearances during his opening weeks at the Catalan giants. But fitness problems have elevated him to a key role under Hansi Flick - and he's seized that opportunity.",
      "Rashford has delivered a goal contribution in five of his previous six outings across all competitions, including an assist before his spectacular double against Newcastle United in the Champions League. Making his return to St James' Park, Rashford nodded Barcelona ahead before unleashing a sensational long-range effort.",
      "He has since provided assists in his subsequent three appearances, serving as a stark reminder to United of his capabilities.",
      "His most recent came earlier this week versus Paris Saint-Germain - a sublime first-time delivery to Ferran Torres.",
      "With Barcelona hunting a decisive goal following Senny Mayulu's leveller, Rashford was withdrawn as Flick justified his substitution.",
      "\"I think you could see in the second half that some players were very tired. Marcus, Pedri, [Frenkie] De Jong,\" he told Diario AS.",
      "\"They gave their all on the pitch. At 1-1, you have to defend better. You have to learn and improve against teams of this quality.\"",
      "Despite the looming threat of injury, Rashford's stellar performances have earned him a spot in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the forthcoming October international fixtures.",
      "He netted a goal in the 5-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Serbia last month, but it appears that's not his primary focus. As per Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo, Rashford is setting his sights on racking up between 30 to 40 assists this season.",
      "From his initial nine competitive outings for the Catalan giants, Rashford has already chalked up four assists and with approximately 40 matches still to play, he'll need to step up his game. Given he's playing alongside the likes of Raphinha, Yamal, Torres and Robert Lewandowski, it's hardly surprising he's set such an ambitious goal.",
      "However, Flick will undoubtedly be expecting more goals from him, particularly with Yamal joining Raphinha on the injury list. The 27-year-old is yet to find the back of the net in La Liga this season, but he'll be aiming to rectify that when they face Sevilla on Sunday afternoon.",

      "Senne Lammens kicked off his Manchester United career with a victory and a clean sheet, earning widespread praise from Belgian media outlets back home. Lammens made the switch to United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but had to bide his time for his debut whilst Ruben Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",
      "The young goalkeeper finally got his chance on Saturday, with Amorim giving him the nod against Sunderland. Everything went to plan for the 23-year-old, as strikes from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko secured United all three points and lifted some heat off their under-pressure boss.",
      "United's triumph came at a crucial moment for Amorim, amid whispers that his position could be under threat following a defeat. Following the result, he heaped praise on Lammens whilst also commending the squad's collective effort.",
      "\"We didn't play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "Whilst Lammens will undoubtedly encounter stiffer challenges than Sunderland this campaign, potentially beginning with his next outing, he still garnered acclaim from the Belgian press. Here's a selection of their comments.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments. Sober, precise and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication highlighted his brilliant stop from a long-range Granit Xhaka strike, plus the fortunate moment when Bertrand Traore was cautioned for simulation after it briefly appeared Lammens might have given away a penalty kick. \"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Another Belgian outlet, HLN, emphasised Amorim's commendation of Lammens whilst noting the shot-stopper observed much of the opening period 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report went on to suggest his upcoming fixture might prove far more challenging. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it continued.",
      "\"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf highlighted United supporters' reaction to the outstanding debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford. The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Three years on, De Jong is approaching the end of his Barca contract, meaning, as it stands, he will be a free agent next summer unless the Catalans try and recoup a transfer fee in January.",
      "Therefore, he could soon come back onto United's radar if Ruben Amorim, or whoever is in charge, decides he would bolster the team's midfield. However, Oscar Garcia, a former Barca youth coach, has advised against signing De Jong.",
      "He argued that while De Jong is a talented player, he doesn't justify his wages. Speaking on Cadena SER's Què t'hi Jugues show during Barcelona's 3-1 victory at Real Oviedo on Thursday, Garcia said: \"I think he's better than you say and worse than what he's paid to do.",
      "\"He's a good player, but he's not the typical footballer we've always had in that position in front of the defence. And he's not decisive enough to be one of the highest-paid.",
      "\"Normally, the highest paid are the ones who decide games. Yes, he's a very good player, but I don't think he can decide a match.\"",
      "De Jong is one of the top earners in the squad, with only Robert Lewandowski earning a higher salary. According to SPORT, Barcelona president Joan Laporta wants to maintain the terms of De Jong's current contract if he stays at the club.",
      "Despite Garcia's criticism, De Jong has made a good start to the season, with seven appearances across La Liga and the Champions League. Barca are currently second in La Liga, two points behind Real Madrid but with a game in hand.",
      "United were linked with a host of top-class midfielders in the summer but failed to add to their ranks in that position. If Amorim is still at the helm come January, he will surely be looking to strengthen that area of the pitch.",
      "The Portuguese coach bought himself some more time on Saturday by leading United to a much-needed 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barca president Joan Laporta is said to have been stunned his United counterparts were willing to agree such a low fee, before seeing how the England star even settled in Spain.",

      "Manchester United and England defender Harry Maguire could be in line for a shock move to the Saudi Pro League. The veteran centre-back, who cost United £80million when they snapped him up from Leicester in 2019 - still a world record for a defender - is out of contract in June.",
      "And Maguire has become a target of Saudi sides Al-Nassr and Al-Ettifaq. He is free to open talks with clubs when January 1 hits and would be able to command huge wages if he decided to head to the Middle East and join the Pro-League.",
      "Maguire's contract had been up last summer, but United elected to trigger a 12-month extension in his deal. Now, the Red Devils aren't expected to offer fresh terms as they look to the future.",
      "Maguire will be 33 in March, and could be tempted to cash in on what would be the last lucrative move of his career, particularly with his England career winding down.",
      "He said of his contract situation in August: \"Last year, the clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there. There was no talking. It was just that they activated it, and it got extended. This year, obviously I'm up at the end of the year.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can't leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",
      "\"I'm sure over the next few months they'll sit down and we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend, or obviously the transfer window will open again in January.",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United squad stepped up to the plate, saving their manager from another uncomfortable post-match inquest and, potentially, even losing his job.",
      "Ahead of the match, Amorim confessed that if results didn't pick up, it would be impossible for him to continue, with this game being touted as a do-or-die situation for the beleaguered United boss. However, first-half goals from Mason Mount and £74million summer recruit Benjamin Sesko paved the way for a comfortable United victory, propelling them to eighth place in the Premier League standings.",
      "Amorim will now hope to see out the international break without the fear of receiving a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his services.",
      "This win was crucial for Amorim to alleviate the mounting pressure on him, amid rumours of players losing confidence in his tactics and the United board beginning to question his suitability. United are still a team under construction and have yet to secure consecutive league victories under Amorim, but this win – even against a lacklustre Sunderland side – has bought the head coach some time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the team that suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford a week ago, giving goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, while Altay Bayindir was relegated to the bench. The United boss had previously stated that the two would compete for the No. 1 spot, and Lammens' performance suggests that Bayindir will struggle to reclaim his position.",
      "Lammens dominated his area, earning a massive cheer in the first half when he confidently collected the ball, and made two impressive saves in each half to round off an excellent debut. Bayindir has struggled to impress early in the season, so it was a breath of fresh air to see some stability brought to the defence.",
      "Sunderland rocked up at Old Trafford following their best start to a top-flight season in 70 years, having racked up 11 points to kick off the game in sixth place in the league table.",
      "Given this context, Amorim and his squad anticipated a tough challenge from Regis Le Bris's team, but the newly-promoted side failed to deliver. United got off to a dream start, taking the lead after just eight minutes, with Bryan Mbeumo setting up Mason Mount, who controlled the ball with his left foot before clinically finishing with his right from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad nearly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, cutting in from the left into the penalty area, then firing a left-footed shot towards goal which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to deflect.",
      "Roefs had to be on his toes again a few minutes later to fend off a shot from Mbeumo, as United ramped up the pressure in pursuit of a second goal to give them a bit more breathing room. United captain Bruno Fernandes then saw a delightful chip tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts bombarded the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "The second goal arrived in the 31st minute, with Benjamin Sesko pouncing on a loose ball and slotting it into the net after Diogo Dalot's long throw-in was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele. It marked Sesko's second goal for United, following his strike in last weekend's defeat at Brentford, and was no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "Sunderland struggled to pose an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to thwart them, diving early to his left to save a low shot from Black Cats captain Granit Xhaka.",
      "United had a scare just before half-time when referee Stuart Attwell awarded a penalty following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. However, after a VAR review and a check on the pitchside monitor, Attwell reversed his decision.",
      "In the end, United's first-half performance was enough to secure the win, setting them up nicely for a massive test after the international break – a trip to reigning champions and fierce rivals Liverpool.",

      "It'll be tough to dislodge him.",
      "Leny Yoro - 7",
      "The Frenchman deserved his return to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two matches. He brings a better balance to United's back three.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 7",
      "He was constantly alert to danger and never found himself out of position while defending his goal. He played a crucial role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it.",
      "Luke Shaw - 7",
      "He retained his spot on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the interval, giving United greater control on the ball.",
      "Amad - 7",
      "He was a constant menace down the right flank. He tormented Sunderland's defence and was unlucky not to score in the first half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved.",
      "Casemiro - 7",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 7",
      "The United captain put in a spirited performance, covering an impressive amount of ground and nearly scoring with a sublime chip that was tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 7",
      "Despite the Brentford mishap, Dalot retained his spot and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko managed to bag United's second goal. His energy levels were commendable.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 7",
      "Mbeumo was a constant thorn in Sunderland's side, providing the assist for Mount's opening goal and consistently making dangerous runs behind the defence.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 7",
      "Sesko found the back of the net for the second consecutive game with a classic poacher's goal from close range in the first half. His aerial threat was utilised effectively by United throughout the match.",
      "Mason Mount - 8",
      "Returning to the starting line-up, Mount justified his selection by setting United on the path to victory with a brilliantly executed goal. He received a standing ovation when he was substituted.",
      "Subs:.",
      "Dorgu (for Dalot, 64) 6 - Solid performance at left wing-back.",
      "Cunha (for Mount, 64) 6 - Provided a lively attacking threat",
      "Mainoo (for Mbeumo, 76) 6 - Didn't have enough time to make an impact on the game.",
      "Ugarte (for Casemiro, 85) N/A - Came on late in the game.",

Altay Bayindir kept his place for the next three Premier League games, but after the Turkey international struggled in last weekend's 3-1 loss against Brentford, Amorim made a change.",
      "Lammens repaid his faith with an assured performance, making a diving save to deny Granit Xhaka a goal from distance in the first half before denying Chemsdine Talbi with his legs late on. Responding to the 23-year-old's stop, the Stretford End chanted: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\", referencing their legendary former goalkeeper, Peter.",
      "Amorim will be delighted with Lammens' performance and the result, which eases pressure on his position during the forthcoming international break. It was billed as a must-win game for the Red Devils boss, with speculation that United were looking at options to replace him after a wretched 11 months in charge and woeful start to the new season.",
      "Ahead of Sunderland's visit, his side had lost four of their opening seven games. First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the perfect tonic, as was a Sunderland penalty which was overturned following a VAR review.",
      "\"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after giving the perfect reply to his doubters. \"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance.",

      "Things finally clicked into gear for Manchester United on a pivotal afternoon for Ruben Amorim, who will be able to enjoy some respite during the international break following a comfortable 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "The pressure and scrutiny has grown on Amorim in recent weeks due to United's poor form and it was imperative United signed off for the international break with a positive result. Step forward Mason Mount, who gave United the perfect platform to do just that with a crisp finish in the eighth minute after he was picked out expertly by Bryan Mbeumo in the penalty area.",
      "The hosts kept pushing with Robin Roefs in the away goal keeping the score down, thwarting Amad, Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes. But he was helpless on the half hour mark when Benjamin Sesko tucked home a first time finish in the six-yard box to give United some breathing space.",
      "It may only be the first weekend in October, but this game felt like must-win territory for Amorim and United. And for all the criticism that has been levelled at the Portuguese coach and his team in recent weeks, they delivered here.",
      "United were far more fluent and looked how you would expect Man United to look playing at home to Sunderland, with all due respect to the visitors. Amad was super effective getting forward at right wing-back and Bruno Fernandes, though playing in a deeper role again, was heavily involved in advanced positions and only denied a goal by an exceptional save from Roefs.",
      "On an afternoon where something had to give, United stepped up. They could - and maybe should - have got more goals, but this result could yet kickstart for their season.",
      "After weeks of talk over the goalkeeper situation, Amorim decided today was the day for Lammens, an £18.2million deadline day signing, to make his bow. And thankfully for United, their new man didn't disappoint on his maiden outing between the sticks.",
      "United are in desperate need of a strong figure in goal with neither Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana convincing during Amorim's tenure. Lammens was assured here and didn't put a foot wrong in difficult conditions.",
      "If Lammens is to be United's No 1 long-term, then he did his chances no harm with this display, which saw him keep the team's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "United spent £200million to address their goalscoring problem in the summer and there are now signs that the tide could be turning. Sesko, the club's marquee signing, has now scored in consecutive Premier League games, while Mbeumo grabbed the assist for United's first.",
      "Some of United's attacking play was slick. Mbeumo's fizzed pass into Mount was a thing of beauty and the former Chelsea midfielder's finish did it justice, while Sesko grew into the game and seems to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "It's still early days but United's new signings will be scrutinised when it comes to returns given the club's outlay. But as long as the goals and assists keep coming, like they did here for Sesko and Mbeumo, then there will be few grumbles.",
      "While all the talk before the game was of Lammens, it was Roefs who stole the show in the first half with a string of fine saves to keep the score down, particularly one world-class save to tip an effort from Fernandes onto the post in the first half.",
      "Sunderland have made a fine start to life back among England's elite but struggled to trouble a United side who finally showed some promise to ease the pressure on their beleaguered head coach.",
      "Make no mistake, today was huge for Amorim. Was his job on the line, as some have suggested? We'll never know given United have won, but it certainly felt must-win. And give credit where credit is due, he got his big calls right here.",
      "The decision to give Lammens the nod in goal was a shrewd one and United looked comfortable defensively. Much has been made of Amorim's 3-4-3 system - and his refusal to deviate from it - but key players such as Amad and Fernandes were effective here as United clinched a much-needed win. United's new-look attack recorded more returns, too, if you're looking for another positive.",
      "This will give him some welcome breathing space during the international break. But as positive as this afternoon was, it will count for little if United don't kick on after the break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sunderland were denied a penalty in controversial circumstances against Manchester United. Benjamin Sesko's high foot came close to Trai Hume's head but did not appear to connect, which saw the initial penalty decision overturned.",
      "There was confusion as Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot amid appeals from the visitors at Old Trafford. The official required some consultation with his linesman before initially awarding an opportunity from 12 yards.",
      "VAR then intervened to assess the incident and ultimately sent Attwell to rewatch the play. It transpired that the ball connected with Hume's face while Sesko did not make contact in the incident, other than perhaps grazing his opponent's shoulder.",
      "Once again, the pace of the decision-making proved infuriating for players and fans alike, as Bruno Fernandes appeared to indicate that it was not a penalty before the official.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre confirmed the process. \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Sunderland.",
      "Referee announcement: “After review, there is no foul by the Manchester United player. He does not make contact with the head of the attacker. As the ball is out of play when the decision was made, the final decision is corner kick.”",
      "Dean said on Soccer Saturday: \"The issue I have, we have referees as VARs and assistant referees as assistant VARs.",
      "\"For some reason today, we've got an assistant referee as VAR and an assistant VAR. So they don't really know what's happened.",
      "\"For me, there's no contact whatsoever. He shouldn't have been sent to the screen, it should have been cleared on the field.\"",
      "It appears, Dean had been caught up in the confusion himself, and had not realised that Attwell's first decision needed to be overturned. The former-ref later clarified: \"The pictures me and Tim [Sherwood] were seeing, unfortunately, looked like it wasn’t given on field and was sent to VAR, I did a bit of digging at half-time and the referee actually gave the decision on field, so for me, he’s got that wrong.",
      "\"I had a bit of a go at Neil Davies, the VAR, saying he shouldn’t have got involved, but he was right to get involved as it was the wrong call by the referee. Neil got it right, sent him to the screen, it was overturned and the correct decision was made.\"",
      "The decision threatened to dampen what had been an exciting opening 45 minutes for Ruben Amorim's side. Mason Mount opened the scoring after just eight minutes as United started on the front foot against their in-form opposition.",
      "Sesko then doubled his side's advantage just after the half-hour mark as the Red Devils looked to get back to winning ways following defeat to Brentford seven days ago. United saw out the second period to earn a 2-0 win.",

      "Jamie Redknapp has suggested that Manchester United target Andoni Iraola could manage 'any club in the world'. The Red Devils are pondering a managerial shake-up following their dismal start to the season.",
      "Current boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat, and a change could be imminent if United's dreadful form persists. A host of managers have been linked with the Old Trafford hot seat, including Bournemouth's Iraola.",
      "The Basque coach has made waves during his stint on the South Coast, with Friday night's victory over Fulham propelling the Cherries into the Champions League spots. Redknapp has been so taken aback by Iraola's performance that he believes he would be a boon to any club, including United.",
      "\"He's got so much quality, he improves players, he gives young players opportunities, the system is great, everything you do is very progressive, it's exciting, it's on the front foot.",
      "\"I would say he's one of the best managers in world football right now. They've just got to enjoy him while he's here. How long? Who knows... amazing manager at such a small club.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Steve Sidwell was in full agreement, stating that players would jump at the opportunity to play under the Spanish coach. He elaborated: \"He simplifies the game. As a footballer, when you go out onto the pitch, you just want two or three instructions, don't overcomplicate, I think that's what he does.",
      "\"If you look at the way Bournemouth play, high intensity, win the ball as high up the pitch as we can. They go direct; they know how to turn teams and play to their strengths.",
      "\"They've got the players around there that will do that. No egos, know their jobs, know their roles. It looks like everyone is enjoying themselves. I'd love to have played under him.\"",
      "Iraola took the reins at Bournemouth back in 2023 after previous manager Gary O'Neil was given his marching orders. In his first season, he guided the club to a respectable 12th place finish, improving to ninth in the subsequent campaign.",
      "The Cherries underwent a significant revamp in the summer, with key players such as Milos Kerkez, Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Dango Outtara all being shown the door during the transfer window. However, this hasn't slowed down Bournemouth's momentum, who have managed to secure four victories from their first seven league matches of the season.",
      "Last summer, Iraola put pen to paper on a new two-year contract with the club, although discussions regarding a contract extension are expected.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Erik ten Hag is being touted for an emotional return to Ajax - just weeks after the former Manchester United manager was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen following their first two games of the new Bundesliga season.",
      "Ten Hag lasted less than four months overall with the former German champions, who selected the Dutchman as their successor to Xabi Alonso. He failed to win either of his two league games at the helm, though, before the club confirmed he was being relieved of his duties; a decision that Ten Hag later blasted as \"unprecedented\" in a strongly-worded statement.",
      "The 55-year-old has seen his reputation take a significant hint over the last 12 months, with his swift exit at Leverkusen following on from his sacking at Manchester United last October. But his struggles in the Premier League and Germany have seemingly not done his chances of a return to Ajax any harm, with De Telegraaf saying such a move could be a possibility come January.",
      "Ten Hag's former club are currently managed by John Heitinga, who has them third in the Eredivisie and has yet to lose in seven league games this term. But Ajax have lost both of their games in the Champions League against Inter Milan and Marseille and some fans are already calling for a change.",
      "While Ajax's top brass are currently reluctant to act, growing fan unrest, coupled with some underwhelming performances, could force their hand, with Ten Hag seemingly an option to step in.",
      "It's noted that Ten Hag would be open to managing Ajax again after leaving the club to join Manchester United almost three-and-a-half years ago. Intriguingly, he was heavily linked with a return to Amsterdam before taking up an offer from Leverkusen earlier this year as the club sought a new head coach.",
      "The club's technical director, Alex Kroes, confirmed there was interest in Ten Hag back in May, saying: \"Erik ten Hag has been on the list for a long time. He is well-known, he did a fantastic job when he was here.",
      "\"I spoke to him briefly on Sunday. He was in the Arena as a spectator,\"",
      "Ten Hag enjoyed a hugely successful four-year spell with Ajax before landing the Manchester United job, winning three league titles and two domestic cups. He also took the club deep into the Champions League in 2019, reaching the semi-finals before Ajax succumbed to Tottenham over two legs.",

      "Ruben Amorim has made a change in goal for Manchester United's huge home game with Sunderland, bringing in summer signing Senne Lammens for Altay Bayindir.",
      "United paid £18.2million to bring Lammens in from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer transfer window but the young Belgian keeper has yet to make an appearance for the Red Devils, with Bayindir featuring in all six of Manchester United's Premier League games so far this season.",
      "Neither Bayindir or last season's No 1, Andre Onana, have convinced in goal during Amorim's tenure, sparking calls for Lammens to be thrust straight into the team. And while Amorim initially resisted, Lammens gets the nod for a game which could have major ramifications for United's Portuguese head coach, who has seen the scrutiny grow on him in recent weeks.",
      "United have made a poor start to the new Premier League campaign, winning just two of their six games. Sunderland is viewed as a must-win fixture for the Red Devils, with some reports suggesting that Amorim could be sacked if United head into the international break off the back of another disappointing result.",
      "Amorim has won just 18 of the 49 matches he has overseen since arriving at Old Trafford last November and he even conceded himself that results need to improve if he is to remain in charge during his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Nobody here is naive,” the United boss said when asked about previous results.",
      "“We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it’s hard – the balance is really hard.”",
      "It had also been suggested recently that Amorim could resign if things do not improve. But the former Sporting Lisbon chief refuted such talk in his presser, adding: “No. That is a board decision. I cannot do that.",
      "“Sometimes I [do] have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game and something happens. That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot.",
      "“But I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.”",

      "Mount finished brilliantly to open the scoring against the Black Cats on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim desperately needed a victory at Old Trafford and made five changes to his starting team, which included the decision to bench Matheus Cunha in favour of starting Mount.",
      "It took just eight minutes for Mount to vindicate his selection and the standing ovation for the midfielder when he was substituted spoke volumes. It was probably his best performance for United.",
      "\"It was obviously a big moment for us today,\" said Mount. \"I mean every game [is big], but today was a lot of pressure on the performance, on the win.",
      "\"Being at home, coming off obviously a difficult result, I think it was so important for us to start sharp. That was something that we obviously spoke about in the dressing room.",
      "\"Bruno spoke about before the game, before kick-off in the huddle. So I felt that, I felt the energy at the beginning of the game and obviously to get the goal, I think really settled us.",
      "\"And then to go on and get another goal, going into half-time 2-0 up, you're in a good place. I don't think we stepped off at all in the second half, it was kept a bit cagey, but it was massive to get a clean sheet as well. So yeah, a very important win for us.\"",
      "Mount continued: \"I think it was massive to really start sharp today. Big character to step up after a difficult game and we did that. Now we've got to push on, we obviously have a bit of a break now before the next game, but we need to take positives from this game and take them into the next one.\"",
      "Amorim has admitted he \"loves\" Mount. \"I see myself as bringing a lot of energy into the team and setting off the press at times, being a bit of a catalyst going forward,\" he reflected.",
      "\"So, yeah, that's always something that I focus on, helping the people around me and really bringing the energy. And to get the goal was obviously massive for me, getting the first goal of the season at home in the Premier League. Important. So, yeah, I really enjoyed that.\"",
      "Mount rounded off an 18-pass sequence - the most passes United have made before a league goal for two years - in the style akin to previous holders of the number seven shirt.",
      "There were green shoots after United's setback against Brentford last weekend. Amorim spoke about negative press potentially affecting the dressing room before Sunderland, but Mount insisted the players are focused on delivering what the manager wants to see on the pitch.",
      "When asked if external noise permeates the dressing room, Mount said: \"No. For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Mount praised the contributions of Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko, while reiterating that the squad is fighting together and behind the manager to 'continue moving forward'.",
      "He said: \"The defenders were amazing. So that was really important for everyone. I mean, for Ben [Sesko], scoring his goal was so important. I'm absolutely over the moon for him.",
      "\"And obviously, Senne [Lammens] coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.",
      "\"And everyone was around him. Altay [Bayindir] was around him. Tom [Heaton] was around him before the game. And that shows the togetherness we have.",
      "\"Obviously, even in this season, we've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking about his relationship with Amorim, Mount added: \"I have a good relationship with the manager. I don't think it's any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes. As I have played it before in the past.",
      "\"So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I've done it before. So, I think that's something that I obviously understand.",
      "\"I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.\"",
      "Mount admitted United's players were hurt after losing against Brentford. \"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" he said.",
      "\"After a game like Brentford, we're hurt. As a team, as a staff, because we know we can do better. It really hurts us, obviously, as a club as well. It feels like a long time until the next game.",
      "\"But when that game does come around, you're prepared. You're ready to really start sharp, as I said before. That was our goal from the beginning. Because we know if we start sharp and we're on the front foot, especially at home, then it can definitely go our way.\"",

      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United made the perfect start to the game when taking an early lead through Mason Mount, and Benjamin Sesko extended the advantage as United led by two heading into the interval.",
      "Ruben Amorim needed a positive result after losing against Brentford last weekend, and there were huge cheers at the final whistle as United moved into the top half of the Premier League.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed at Old Trafford:",
      "Lammens sparkles on his debut",
      "Lammens finally made his debut after his deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp. Fans had wondered when Lammens would be given his first start, and it felt sensible to play him against Sunderland.",
      "The bar is low for Lammens to impress at United, given that supporters have watched error-prone goalkeepers Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir underperform over the last few seasons.",
      "That was highlighted when Lammens made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Granit Xhaka near the end of the first half. It was a decent save from Lammens - but a stop any goalkeeper worth their salt should make - and it was met by huge applause from each corner of the ground.",
      "Then Lammens came to claim a cross into the box with authority just minutes later - and the reaction from the crowd was so loud you would have thought they were celebrating a goal.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt sprinted to Lammens to congratulate him after the final whistle. Lammens also received a hug from Harry Maguire and a high five from Luke Shaw.",
      "Mount's first pump to the crowd",
      "Amorim made five changes to his starting XI to face Sunderland and Mount was selected to start over Matheus Cunha, a decision which was vindicated just eight minutes into the contest.",
      "Mbeumo picked out Mount in the box, but he still had plenty to do. Mount brought the ball down with his left foot and the touch was slightly heavy, although that didn't stop him from finishing intelligently.",
      "Amorim reacted on the touchline by calmly giving a simple thumbs up to his coaching staff, however, Mount's celebration in front of the Stretford End was a tad more enthusiastic.",
      "Mount roared to the terraces and passionately fist-pumped as his teammates prepared for the restart. You can tell the 26-year-old genuinely cares when he plays, and that goes a long way in the modern game.",
      "The towel worked a treat",
      "Amorim wore a full tracksuit against Sunderland and United scored a goal that Tony Pulis, who famously wore a full tracksuit during his managerial days in the Premier League, would have been proud of.",
      "Dalot launched a long throw into the box for Sesko's goal to make it 2-0. The Slovenia international reacted well to the flick-on to score his second goal for United in a week.",
      "Before taking the throw-in, Dalot dried the ball with a towel to improve his grip, which worked a treat. Arsenal have enjoyed success with Mikel Arteta in charge by making the most of the 'dark arts' and the introduction of towels around the side of the pitch was a no-brainer for United.",
      "Following Sesko's goal, Dalot created another opportunity with a long throw-in and he benefited from the towel again. United must do everything they can to give themselves the best chance of winning.",
      "Amorim learned from Chelsea",
      "It was disappointing to see Casemiro receive a second yellow card against Chelsea, as United were cruising into half-time before he foolishly made a cynical foul, which meant both sides had 10 men for the second half.",
      "However, Amorim learned from that episode by substituting Casemiro off against Sunderland just minutes after he had received a yellow card for bringing Brian Brobbey to the ground.",
      "Amorim could not take any risks with five minutes remaining and introduced Manuel Ugarte.",
      "No banner, no problem",
      "Amorim emerged from the tunnel for kick-off shortly after his players had walked out from the dressing room. And there wasn't much applause for Amorim from the Stretford End.",
      "It was also interesting that \"the good days are coming\" banner could not be spotted among the banners and flags that were unfurled. That banner was seen in the Stretford End before the Burnley game last month, but it appeared to be left at home after a bad result against Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim did receive some applause from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, though.",
      "Matchgoing fans have continued to back Amorim, despite him failing to give them a reason to, but the muted reception for his emergence from the tunnel suggested a few have started to change their minds.",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko promised he will continue to improve after scoring against Sunderland.",
      "Sesko scored his second goal for the club in a 2-0 win against the Black Cats at Old Trafford.",
      "The Slovenia international reacted quickly to poke home at the Stretford End in the 31st minute, which extended United's advantage following an opening goal from Mason Mount.",
      "Sesko celebrated by leaping into the air and he was clearly delighted during his post-match interview with MUTV. \"It feels amazing,\" he said. \"It feels even better because I helped the team win the game. Because in the end, it's important to win the match. I try to help the team as much as possible.",
      "\"The atmosphere afterwards [following the second goal] was unbelievable. It's something I've been dreaming about - jumping high in the stadium like that. My dream came true.",
      "\"It's my job to try to score as many goals as possible, try to win the game, try to help the team in every single situation and hopefully I get more moments like this.\"",
      "Sesko was asked whether fans have seen the best of him and responded: \"No, not yet. There's loads to come. I'm still getting used to it more and more to read the players, to be connected with them even more. I believe I can be even better and I will try to show that.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference between the Premier League and Bundesliga, Sesko said: \"I would say it's way quicker and you have less time in general. This is one of the biggest changes, I would say. Everyone is really physical and athletic, but I'm getting used to it. I'll come to this level soon.",
      "\"To play for a club like this, even train every day, is an obvious pleasure and I'm looking forward to being back [after the international break].\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 appearances during his two-year stint with Leipzig.",

      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has bought the head coach more time.",
      "Amorim made five changes from the side that lost 3-1 at Brentford a week earlier, handing goalkeeper Senne Lammens his United debut, with Altay Bayindir demoted to the bench.",
      "The United boss had already declared the pair would fight it out for the No.1 spot and the way Lammens performed suggests it will be hard for Bayindir to win back his place.",
      "Lammens commanded his area, earned a huge first-half cheer when he came for the ball and confidently collected it, and produced two fine saves in either half to cap a solid first game. Bayindir has failed to convince in the early parts of the season and it was refreshing to see some stability brought to the backline.",
      "Sunderland arrived at Old Trafford on the back of their best start to a top-flight season for 70 years, having amassed 11 points to start the game in sixth position in the table.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim and his players expected Regis Le Bris's side to provide a stern test, but it was anything but that as their newly-promoted opponents failed to show up.",
      "United made the perfect start, taking the lead after eight minutes, Bryan Mbeumo picking out Mason Mount, who took the ball down with his left foot before producing a clinical finish with his right to score from just inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Amad came close to making it 2-0 in the 20th minute, cutting inside from the left and into the penalty area, then unleashing a goal-bound left-footed strike which Sunderland 'keeper Robin Roefs did well to turn away.",
      "Roefs had to be alert again a couple of minutes later to repel a shot from Mbeumo, as United stepped up a gear in search of a second goal to give them some more breathing space.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes saw a delightful chipped effort tipped onto the bar by Roefs, as the hosts laid siege to the goalmouth at the Stretford End.",
      "But the second goal duly came in the 31st minute, Benjamin Sesko reacting quickest to turn the loose ball into the net after a long throw-in from Diogo Dalot was flicked on by Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele.",
      "It was Sesko's second goal for United, having scored in the defeat at Brentford last weekend, and no more than Amorim's side deserved.",
      "The visitors did not provide much in the way of an attacking threat, but when they did, Lammens was there to deny them, getting down early to his left to keep out a low shot from Black Cats skipper Granit Xhaka.",
      "United survived a penalty scare in first-half added time when referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot following a high challenge from Sesko on Sunderland's Trai Hume. VAR checked the incident and after Attwell went to the pitchside monitor to review it, he reversed his original decision.",
      "Ultimately, United did enough in the first-half to secure the win ahead of a huge test after the international break – a trip to champions and arch rivals Liverpool.",

      "Senne Lammens made quite the impression on his Manchester United debut this weekend - but a strong first showing doesn't always guarantee a long-term place in the first team.",
      "It's a lesson former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson learned the hard way. After dazzling in his first appearance for the club during a League Cup tie against Luton back in 2020, Henderson was tipped for the very top.",
      "Many - including then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - saw him not just as United's future No. 1, but England's as well. Ultimately, though, neither prediction came to pass.",
      "With David de Gea firmly established ahead of him, Henderson found opportunities hard to come by. He later suggested that promises had been broken and admitted that his patience at Old Trafford \"wasted\" a large portion of his career.",
      "After joining United's academy in 2011, Henderson took his first steps into senior football on loan at Stockport County. His breakthrough, however, came at Sheffield United, where his standout performances in the club's 2019/20 Premier League campaign cemented his reputation as one of England's brightest talents.",
      "Interest in Henderson was high at the end of the season, but he decided to stay at United after reportedly being told he'd be first choice in a year's time. Things initially started brightly. After making what Henderson described as a \"dream\" debut for the club, he went on to make 26 appearances in all competitions in 2020/21.",
      "\"I dreamt about this my whole life!!\" Henderson wrote on social media after his first appearance in a United shirt. \"Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!\"",
      "However, by the time the 2021/22 season rolled around, it was clear that De Gea would not only remain at the club, but also keep the No. 1 shirt - leaving Henderson understandably feeling let down.",
      "\"To sit there and waste 12 months is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming,\" he told talkSPORT in 2022. \"I turned so many good loans down last summer for that reason [being promised No.1 spot], and they wouldn't let me go. It was frustrating.\"",
      "Henderson took matters into his own hands, hurriedly organising a loan move to Nottingham Forest before new manager Erik ten Hag's arrival in the summer of 2022. \"I didn't really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew he'd probably want to keep me,\" Henderson explained.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"So I tried to do it all before I left for the season, I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football. I don't want to be here playing second fiddle. And it panned out so I was almost gone before the manager came in the door and I haven't spoken to him since.\"",
      "At the City Ground, Henderson finally got the game-time he'd been craving. But an ill-timed thigh injury ruled him out for the second half of the season, halting the momentum he'd finally been building.",
      "A permanent move to Crystal Palace followed in 2023, though his first season at Selhurst Park saw him share goalkeeping duties with Sam Johnstone. By the 2024/25 campaign, however, Henderson had truly come into his own - establishing himself as Palace's first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "He capped off the campaign in style, saving a penalty in Palace's remarkable 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Now, he stands as a key figure in the squad as the club embarks on its first-ever European adventure in the Conference League this season.",
      "United must be looking on with some regret. The man who was blocking Henderson's path, David de Gea, left the same summer the Red Devils academy graduate did. De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, then endured a difficult two-year spell between the posts before moving on loan to Trabzonspor last month.",
      "In the weeks since, Altay Bayindir has been tasked with filling the void, with mixed results. However, there is cause for optimism. Summer signing Senne Lammens made a bright impression during Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland, producing a couple of crucial saves to secure United's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "The Belgian also stood out for his composure, both on the ball and when facing shots, and looks well on his way to establishing himself as United's No. 1. But as Henderson's cautionary tale has taught us, a positive start doesn't guarantee anything.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was at Ipswich Town's East Anglia Derby against Norwich City to show his support for former colleague Kieran McKenna.",
      "In August, Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas after just seven months in charge of the Turkish club. Prior to his dismissal, Solskjaer oversaw his team losing 2-1 on aggregate to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport in the qualifying round of the Conference League.",
      "Shortly afterward, Solskjaer returned to England and was in Suffolk to watch Ipswich's 5-0 victory over Sheffield United. The 52-year-old has now returned to East England to show his support for the Tractor Boys in their fierce derby day clash with Norwich.",
      "In the second half, with Ipswich winning 2-1 thanks to Cedric Kipre and Jaden Philogene's goals either side of Oscar Schwartau's equaliser, Solskjaer was spotted by the TV cameras watching the action. While Portman Road is perhaps not where you would expect to see the former striker, there is good reason for it.",
      "Ipswich boss McKenna worked as Solskjaer's assistant at United after being promoted to the first-team by Jose Mourinho. Between 2018 and 2021, McKenna remained in the United dugout but he would leave not long after Solskjaer was sacked to take up the role as head coach at Ipswich.",
      "Since then, it has been a rollercoaster ride for McKenna at the Tractor Boys. He led them from League One to the Premier League thanks to successive promotions.",
      "However, Ipswich would last just one season in the Premier League before being relegated back to the Championship. Solskjaer has previously spoken fondly of McKenna.",
      "In 2023, he told The Athletic: \"Kieran was a surprise to me when I got to United. Michael [Carrick], I already knew.",
      "\"We'd been coached by Sir Alex, from the old school. Kieran was not.",
      "\"He's the most thorough and analytical, step-by-step, process-driven coach that I've worked with. He makes it so easy for the players to see and understand what we wanted from them.\"",
      "Solskjaer is currently on the bookmakers' list of potential next managers at United. Should Amorim be sacked before New Year's Day, Solskjaer is priced at 14/1 with bet365 to be appointed as his replacement.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",

      "Wayne Rooney has humorously conceded that Michael Owen was \"clearly\" a superior footballer at the age of 17. The Manchester United legend had the final say during the latest episode of Match of the Day.",
      "The two have recently found themselves embroiled in a debate over who was more talented in their debut years. The discussion began when Owen said on the Rio Ferdinand podcast: \"I saw Wazza got asked who was the best out of us at the age of 17 or 18. And I did smile,\" before adding: \"The only person you could possibly compare me to in our country is Wayne Rooney.\"",
      "In response, Rooney said: \"I think his comments are fair. Of course, he's going to back himself. I'd back myself.",
      "\"But, I'd never judge myself against Michael Owen because he's someone I actually looked up to and had the pleasure of playing alongside.\"",
      "After a heated national debate about who was the superior player, it seems Rooney has finally put the argument to bed. During Saturday evening's Match of the Day, following Bukayo Saka's 100th goal involvement in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over West Ham, Gabby Logan presented a chart showing players who have achieved the same feat and the number of games it took them, reports the Mirror.",
      "The presenter added: \"You're just behind Michael Owen, he's top of the pops there, for players with 100 Premier League goal involvements and how few games they've got there - 153 for Michael, 187 for you, 212 for Bukayo.\"",
      "To which, Rooney replied: \"Yeah, I think that clearly shows that Michael was a better player than I was at that age,\" before erupting with laughter. He then added: \"But no, I think for Saka, he's such an important player for Arsenal and for England.",
      "\"I think over the last three or four years, he's probably been Arsenal's most important player. He's had a few injuries which have affected...those numbers would even better if that weren't the case I believe. But yeah, he's such an incredible player.\"",
      "Declan Rice broke the deadlock against his former side on Saturday afternoon with a precisely-placed effort beyond Alphonse Areola into the top left corner after 38 minutes. Saka then extended Arsenal's advantage in the second period, calmly slotting home from 12 yards after Jurrien Timber was fouled inside the West Ham penalty area.",
      "Both Rooney and Owen enjoyed remarkable playing careers in England's top flight. Rooney presently occupies third position in the Premier League's all-time goalscoring charts with 208 goals for Everton and Manchester United, trailing only Shearer and Harry Kane who have netted 260 and 213 goals respectively.",
      "Owen, however, didn't make the top 10 despite scoring 150 goals during his remarkable career with Liverpool, Newcastle United, Manchester United, and Stoke City.",

      "Man City and Man United have made some major changes to their kit prices. Ahead of the international break next week, both clubs have begun offering discounts up to 30% on this season’s home, away and third kits.",
      "It comes as both clubs play their final Premier League fixture before the international break this weekend, with Man United earning an important three points against Sunderland on Saturday. This has left Ruben Amorim’s side level on points with Man City, who travel to Brentford on Sunday before the season pauses for the latest round of World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Fans can secure their discounted football strips from Fanatics, where the Man City 2025/26 Home Shirt has dropped from £85 to £59.90. This marks a 29% price cut, with the same deal also available with the Man City 2025/26 Away Shirt and Man City 2025/26 Third Shirt.",
      "The Red half of the city can secure 25% off the Man United 2025/26 Home Shirt and Man United 2025/26 Away Shirt, both of which are reduced from £85 to £63.75. However, only the authentic edition of the Man United 2025/26 Third Shirt is on sale at £90, down from £120.",
      "Fanatics also offers countless shirts with player printing, including new signings such as the Man City 2025/26 Home Shirt with Haaland 9 printing for £70, down from £100. There’s also the Man United 2025/26 Home Shirt with B. Fernandes 8 printing for £75, down from £100.",
      "There are also kit options for female or younger fans on both sides, with Man City Women's and Man City Kids, or Man United Women's and Man United Kids. All kits can also be found at the official club stores and manufacturers, Puma and adidas.",
      "Man City and Man United launched their current strips ahead of the 2025/26 Premier League season to mixed reactions from fans. Perhaps the most unique of the strips is Man City’s third kit, which features a raindrop design said to be a ‘tribute to Mancunian weather’.",
      "It drew criticism from fans on social media, with one person harshly arguing that the designer ‘should be sacked’. Another said: “Not a bad shout to say this is the worst kit of all time.”",
      "It found some fans though, as this Blue said: “Wow, this is super cool.” Elsewhere, Man United fans were more positive to their club’s retro third strip inspired by the black away kit worn between 1993 and 1995.",
      "One Red said: “This looks amazing, Man United nailed the retro vibe.” Another said: “This is absolutely fire.”",
      "However, this fan had a more tongue-in-cheek response, saying: “Will look nice in the away end when they’re playing Stockport next season.”",

That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",
      "Garnacho was pivotal to Chelsea's winning goal against Benfica on Tuesday with his cross turned into his own net by Richard Rios. The Argentine has since posted an Instagram story captioned: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "24 hours later, Rashford assisted Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a perfectly-weighted pass. The European champions ultimately won the game, but Rashford was a livewire throughout with another clear message sent to Amorim as that is the 27-year-old's sixth goal contribution since moving",
      "Hojlund also sent an unexpectedly cheeky message after a clinical finish with his weaker right foot and a brave headed goal in Napoli's 2-1 win over Sporting CP with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne the supplier for both.",

Perhaps crucially, Southgate is close friends with Dan Ashworth, whose long-term plan was to appoint Southgate during his time at United before departing after five months.",
      "\"One or two matches, you get flashes. They [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",

      "Amorim informed United of his desire to remain at Sporting for the remainder of the 2024/25 season, with the Portuguese chief keen to bring in his own players and spend a full pre-season with the squad before kicking off his United tenure. He was told it was now or never, and United had their man.",
      "While the club's stance worked - and had United started this season in good form we'd all be praising the decision to appoint him mid-season in getting the teething problems out of the way last term - their ultimatum may well have done more harm than good.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe might be keen to view this campaign as Amorim's first at the club, but the disaster that was the 2024/25 season simply cannot be forgotten.",
      "The league campaign was nothing more than an inconvenience in the final months of the season. It was Europa League or bust and United produced a performance befitting their season in Bilbao as they surrendered to perennial nearly-men Tottenham.",
      "Had Amorim arrived in the summer, a new man full of new ideas with a winning reputation, the flurry of big-money moves and uplifting pre-season campaign would have been the perfect platform from which to launch the Amorim era.",
      "As it is, the United boss' methods will forever be synonymous with the worst United team in 51 years. Trying to convince a group of players that the system that led them to their worst season in half a century is the one that will bring the glory days back to Old Trafford is a tall order.",
      "It may well be that Amorim turns the ship around, but the United boss needs to starting picking up points and he needs to do it fast.",
      "Ratcliffe may want to forget about last season, but it's not that simple.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS brains trust would ideally never learn any lessons ever, perennially extending this exasperating process by ignoring every issue and clinging to all potential positives.",
      "Sure, Old Trafford is surrounded by myriad dumpster fires but at least they’re generating enough light and warmth to save on the energy bill and avert any further redundancies.",
      "It should be said that this was a rare break from the “suffering”. Manchester United were competent against Sunderland. Good, even. Great at times. Mason Mount continues to prove himself to be any manager’s favourite player, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have formed a tantalising link on the right, and Benjamin Sesko needed only one gilt-edged chance rather than three in succession to score.",
      "And on his Premier League debut, Senne Lammens kept the club’s first clean sheet of the season. He was hardly needed to produce the sort of volume of saves which attracted Manchester United to his ability in the first place, but one confident claim from a high Noah Sadiki cross was greeted with rapturous applause and very possibly a few disbelieving supporters fainting in the stands.",
      "Robin Roefs was once again more outwardly impressive at the other end, tipping a wonderful Bruno Fernandes effort onto the bar in his most eye-catching stop. But Manchester United twice found a way through one of the better defensive teams in this myriad Premier League season and wholly deserved their win.",
      "It is vanishingly rare that everything Amorim touches turns to gold. But the Lammens call, bringing Leny Yoro in for Harry Maguire, even dropping Matheus Cunha for Mount were all vindicated.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo got his 13-minute cameo, Casemiro was substituted before he was given the opportunity to get stupidly sent off, and Amorim managed to both have and eat his cake with a trademark centre-half swap with five minutes remaining as Sunderland laboured to find anything resembling a foothold.",
      "Regis Le Bris even felt compelled to alter his system in the first half to match the hosts with the introduction of large Dan Ballard. Amorim, for once, had no reason to follow suit.",
      "He knows “results dictate everything”. Amorim had ventured into the ever so slightly desperate before the game with his controversial rework of a John Lennon classic, saying: “Imagine if we had won the first game against Arsenal, hadn’t missed the penalty, and had won against Fulham even without playing well.”",
      "His basic point was that winning breeds confidence and fine margins have often been the difference. But it is gloriously quaint to hear the manager of Manchester United essentially say: “Imagine if we had just won these games.”",
      "This weekend and over the international break, they need no such creative thinking. An entirely routine, straightforward victory with no suffering in sight might be the most significant result of Amorim’s reign yet.",
      "Man Utd are “not going to rush into a decision” over sacking Ruben Amorim as a journalist reveals the likelihood of the Red Devils head coach resigning.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville insists the Red Devils hierarchy will be “relieved” at the win over Sunderland but Ruben Amorim is not “off the hook”.",
      "Liverpool are officially in a ‘mini crisis’ which Arne Slot and two players in particular seems to be making worse. Chelsea and Enzo Maresca took advantage.",
      "Liverpool’s “mess” is worse than it initially seemed as this form of Arne Slot’s side have no chance of winning the Premier League title this season…",
      "Arsenal will be praying for a potentially game-changing reprieve after Mikel Arteta’s new experiment against West Ham United confirmed a turning point…",
      "If Thomas Frank needs to make one change to his Spurs team, it’s in goal. Another mistake at Leeds surely means Guglielmo Vicario is for the chop."

      "Amorim is the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, so he really needs a win on Saturday as his Man Utd side hosts Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "There has been little sign of improvement from Man Utd at the start of this campaign, as Amorim‘s 3-4-3 system is still failing, and it’s hard to see this changing.",
      "The pressure has mounted on Amorim following a run of three Premier League defeats in six matches, while they have suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has not done much right since taking over at Man Utd, with the head coach under immense scrutiny over his refusal to adapt and he’s also been criticised for sticking with Alter Bayindir following the deadline day arrival of Senne Lammens.",
      "Bayindir is not good enough to be anything more than a No.2 for Man Utd, and he’s been a weak link at the start of this season, but he has retained a starting berth as Amorim has opted to ease Lammens into the fold.",
      "However, this has changed on Saturday as Amorim has ‘thrown Lammens into the fray’ against Sunderland, with the £18m goalkeeper making his first Premier League start.",
      "On this decision, BBC journalist Simon Stone explained: ‘With his back against the wall and huge pressure over his job, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has handed £18.1m goalkeeper Senne Lammens his debut.",
      "‘The deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp has sat out the last three games but Amorim has decided today is the day to throw the 23-year-old into the fray.",
      "‘United were bullish about the decision to sign Lammens in preference to Aston Villa’s World Cup winner Emi Martinez, citing the positive data that show him to be one of Europe’s most promising young goalkeepers.",
      "‘There is no easing in period. Lammens needs to perform today.’",
      "Ahead of Saturday’s game, Amorim has explained why he is not scared to lose his job.",
      "“The worst thing in this job is not to win games,” Amorim said.",
      "“And that is the same feeling in Casa Pia when I lose in the third division. It’s a dream to be here and I want to continue here and I want to fight for this.",
      "“But the problem is now. What makes me suffer is to lose games, it is not to lose my job. You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills. And I don’t have that feeling. I just want to continue this.",
      "“But when we don’t win games, that is the suffering that I have. It’s not the fear of losing the job. I don’t care.”",

Why? Well because they’re playing to keep their job so.",

One is literally backed by data science and not even an opinion and the other is what happens to all players as they age.

Unfortunately his style, coaching and tactics are sh*t.

      "When the autobiographies come out in a few years time and we learn the real story behind this season it’ll be obvious that the thing affecting the start of this season wasn’t the new formation or Florian Wirtz getting up to the speed of the league, it was, as it clearly is, a group of people struggling with how to cope with a tragedy. And the way we all keep ignoring it in the conversation just shows how far we still have to go in learning to communicate with each other when things go South.",

      "While many would have sent Ruben Amorim packing from Manchester United already and almost all others would see an inevitable defeat to high-flying Sunderland on Saturday as the final straw, amid reports claiming that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will give the Portuguese boss a full season as he fails to come to terms with yet another Old Trafford mistake, Amorim is indeed set to survive the upcoming international break.",
      "But in clarifying the full-season “yardstick” Ratcliffe and Ineos will use to decide his future, journalist Ben Jacobs has confirmed his sacking in the next international break.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around,” Jacobs said. “I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season. Speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Having now infamously won just 34 points from his first 33, Amorim has five games to save his job, or five to see out before his escape, depending how he’s looking at things.",
      "",
      "It will have been seen as an absolute banker by Manchester United fans trawling the fixture list at the start of the season. An Old Trafford clash against newly-promoted Sunderland, who have beaten United just twice in the Premier League in 30 meetings, losing 22 of them, since Michael Gray and John Mullin goals earned them all three points in March 1997, give it a tick and move on.",
      "But six games into the season we’re wondering if there is a worse fixture for Amorim and United to be playing. Sunderland are sixth having conceded just four goals in those six games, and while no-one expects them to hold that position, there also won’t be many still considering them as relegation candidates. They’ve got good players, a good manager and crucially – in stark contrast to United – are a team.",
      "And yet, they are still Sunderland. They’ve still only just come up, they’ve still got plenty of players in their first Premier League season, just like their manager. It would therefore still be written up as a disaster of biblical proportions if United were to lose to them.",
      "Can’t have that though – Amorim’s got to make it through another four games. A 1-1 draw. Harry Maguire equaliser in stoppage time.",
      "",
      "The 2-2 draw at Anfield last season ushered in Amorim’s best/only half-decent spell as United boss. It was a timely result on the back of defeats to Tottenham, Bournemouth and Wolves, and preceded five wins in six games, including the 6-4 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup a week later.",
      "Amorim said afterwards that he was “upset” United didn’t claim all three points, but while we’re all doing our level best to insist Premier League leaders Liverpool are currently in the midst of a mini-crisis and defeat to Chelsea on Saturday would ensure a full-blown one for us all to ruminate over for the international break, it’s hard to imagine the level of catastrophe required for Arne Slot’s side not to beat United at Anfield.",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked after Victor Osimhen ran rings around him in another calamitous showing from one of the top ten slumping Premier League players against Galatasaray. Enter Dr. Sesko.",
      "No goals for United then and there’s nothing like a game against United to break Mohamed Salah out of a funk. Hat-trick for him. 0-4.",
      "",
      "This fixture last season was very nearly the end of Amorim, who had reportedly become so ‘disenchanted’ with life at United after a run of one Premier League win in six culminated in the 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls at Old Trafford that he was ‘prepared to resign’ and had to be talked off the ledge by the United bosses.",
      "Despite there being ‘no formal move to quit’ after the game in January, the Portuguese head coach ‘had to be reassured by senior figures at the club, including CEO Omar Berrada, that he would be backed to turn the team’s fortunes around.’",
      "We don’t know how Amorim could see a summer in which United failed to sign a new No.6 or No.1 as one in which he received sufficient backing, but it feels as though he’s been on the brink of resignation as well as the sack pretty much ever since.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has already led Brighton to victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season. 1-2.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou being sacked twice before Ruben Amorim after beating him in the Europa League final is both brilliant and famously unjust in equal measure, if it wasn’t definitely actually slightly more brilliant than unjust.",
      "That currently looks very likely to be the case after he was jeered off by Nottingham Forest fans on Thursday following his fourth defeat as manager in six winless games. He wasn’t “sacked in the morning” but surely will be next week if they fail to turn Newcastle over on Sunday.",
      "Amorim is f***ed either way. Ange got the better of him three times last season – 1-0 wins in the UEL final and the Premier League and a 4-3 in the League Cup quarter-final. United also lost both games to Forest and if Ange has gone then they may still be in the midst of a new manager bounce, which they’re due having experienced more of a splat post Nuno-Espirito Santo.",
      "Please, for the love of all that is great and holy, let it be Erik ten Hag guiding his new team to a 1-0 victory.",
      "",
      "United haven’t beaten Tottenham in their last seven meetings, losing five of them, and if current Brentford boss Keith Andrews can “out-school” Amorim after a full eight games as a professional football manager we can only assume that former Brentford manager Thomas Frank – widely regarded as one of the very finest tacticians around – will teach him a sack-ensuring lesson in north London.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo to score a consolation as the last United goal in the Amorim era from the bench. 4-1.",
      "Man Utd are “not going to rush into a decision” over sacking Ruben Amorim as a journalist reveals the likelihood of the Red Devils head coach resigning.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville insists the Red Devils hierarchy will be “relieved” at the win over Sunderland but Ruben Amorim is not “off the hook”.",
      "Manchester United beat a thoroughly decent opponent and manager in a game of association football. It was ‘must-win’ and Ruben Amorim just…did.",

      "Ryan Sessegnon had injury-ravaged Fulham on course for a 1-0 win after breaking the deadlock, though Bournemouth responded brilliantly to going behind; Semenyo’s exquisite solo goal and clinical last-minute finish, either side of Justin Kluivert’s latest long-range strike, sealed a 3-1 win that moves the hosts up to 2nd (SECOND) in the Premier League.",
      "Bournemouth’s fourth victory from seven Premier League games adds to their stellar start to the 2025/26 season, with the Cherries not breaking stride despite losing Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi in the summer.",
      "It says a lot about how well-run Bournemouth are that their replacements, particularly Bafode Diakite and Adrien Truffert, have seamlessly settled into the Premier League, thus preventing a post-summer decline, while highly respected head coach Iraola is another trump card up their sleeve.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Chelsea v Liverpool, Tottenham, Postecoglou, Haaland, Kane",
      "Iraola quickly made Bournemouth supporters forget about former boss Gary O’Neil, with the Cherries collecting the seventh-most points in the Premier League since his arrival in October 2023.",
      "So it’s no wonder Bournemouth are desperate to tie Iraola to a new contract before his deal expires this summer, though the prospect of him remaining in charge beyond this season appears to be decreasing by the day.",
      "Iraola finds himself in the middle of the manager sack conversation as he’s being mentioned as a potential replacement for big clubs in the Premier League and Europe, including Manchester United.",
      "Various outlets have claimed that he is on Man Utd’s shortlist of possible replacements for under-fire boss Ruben Amorim, with Glasner and Gareth Southgate among the lesser-suited alternatives.",
      "Given that Iraola is also being loosely linked with Chelsea and Manchester City, United would be pulling off a major coup if they secure his services, though there is recent evidence to suggest that their pulling power remains undiminished despite their on-field woes.",
      "From beating Newcastle United to several summer signings to recently gaining the favour of Glasner, Man Utd’s lure is still overwhelming, so when it came to making a decision, it would be a surprise if Iraola said no to INEOS.",

      "Regardless of how this weekend’s match against Sunderland goes (another harrowing loss wouldn’t be a shock at all), Amorim is done at Man Utd because he won’t oversee a long-term fix amid his unrelenting insistence on playing his 3-4-3 formation, which is not suited to the club or his squad.",
      "The sooner he and Man Utd move on, the better, though talk regarding a caretaker appointment is nonsense, as INEOS cannot be seen to write off a season after fewer than ten games.",

      "In hindsight, INEOS’ appointment of Amorim was a huge mistake, but the ruthless manner in which they went about this raid should be commended as a deal was struck under the noses of Man City, who appeared to be laying the groundwork for Amorim to replace Pep Guardiola.",

      "Therefore, Zirkzee, according to Football Insider‘s Pete O’Rourke, is ‘unhappy at Man Utd’ as there ‘will be an issue’ on one condition.",

      "“He’s only made three appearances in the Premier League this season, with only one of those as a start, and has played just 82 minutes in total.",
      "“He isn’t happy with that situation, but obviously Amorim spent heavily on attacking reinforcements in the summer with Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo.",
      "“There’s always been interest in Zirkzee from Italy because of how well he did for Bologna before his move to Man United, so Como and Juventus are keeping tabs on his situation.",

      "In Postecoglou‘s case, this is mightily impressive as he has changed clubs and arguably remains under as much scrutiny as Amorim, who is still on the brink at Man Utd.",
      "Postecoglou could and perhaps should have hammered the final nail in Amorim’s coffin at Man Utd when his Spurs side did a job on the Red Devils to win last season’s Europa League. However, it was Big Ange, whose position at Tottenham remained untenable amid their dire Premier League form, who was sacked following the match.",

      "You somewhat have to admire Amorim’s bullish refusal to adapt in an attempt to save face (and boost his chances of falling on his feet elsewhere a la Vincent Kompnay), but this decision will be his undoing at Man Utd.",
      "And while Amorim’s disastrous reign has continued to descend, Postecoglou has returned to management by replacing Nuno Espirito Santo at Nottingham Forest.",

      "However, the decision from Forest to appoint Postecoglou was nonsensical, given that he and Nuno have polar opposite playing styles and that they are attempting to usher in this seismic change a few games into the new season rather than in the summer.",
      "Nuno also retains the support of Forest’s supporters, so Postecoglou to Forest was destined for disaster from the get-go, and it’s already falling apart, with home fans calling for his demise during the 3-2 loss against FC Midtjylland on Thursday.",
      "So Forest, like Man Utd, should soon be looking for a new manager and their search could begin as early as this month’s international break if this weekend goes awry.",
      "Then, a swap deal involving Amorim and Postecoglou obviously won’t be considered, but this would be a less daft route than Man Utd and Nottm Forest appointing their current managers in the first place.",
      "Put simply, this is because Forest, unlike Man Utd, actually has players ready-made for Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, while Postecoglou would immediately get brownie points at Old Trafford for using players in their natural positions in a 4-3-2-1 formation, which is perfect for this current Red Devils squad.",
      "I’m not saying that Amorim would excel at Nottm Forest and vice versa with Postecoglou at Man Utd, but the two managers and clubs would be better if they sanctioned this never-before-seen swap deal than they are at the moment.",

      "It will come as no great surprise that after a week which has seen Liverpool cede the Premier League title to Arsenal despite retaining top spot before falling to a second defeat of the season to Galatasaray that there are four members of Arne Slot’s crisis squad included in this list of Premier League players experiencing concerning downturns in 2025/2026.",
      "Whether after a summer move or having simply failed to maintain form for the same club, these guys are all a worry.",
      "",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked having watched another one of the centre-back’s Liverpool performances directed by Mel Brooks, featuring the Laurel and Hardy theme. It was Victor Osimhen on Tuesday, Jean-Philippe Mateta last weekend and Joao Pedro will be champing at the bit on Saturday, assuming Slot doesn’t remove the opportunity for further farce by taking him out of the firing line.",
      "There are indeed rumours of a move to Real Madrid, and no progress on a new contract suggests he will move on a free transfer at the end of the season. But the way his head has been turned and seemingly removed entirely from his neck stands in stark contrast to Marc Guehi’s reaction to what was a transfer that actually very nearly happened.",
      "“The sun goes up, the sun comes down, life goes on,” the wonderfully sanguine Guehi said. What Slot wouldn’t give to have him over Konate right now.",
      "",
      "Very difficult for any Manchester United player who was around last season to experience a slump in form that doesn’t leave them as a boneless mess of offal on the Old Trafford turf, though human entrails may have been a more useful plug for the midfield hole than Manuel Ugarte has proved to be this term.",
      "Fortunately they spent £200m on a whole new forward line, and we could just as easily have plumped for either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo here, who have scored a goal and claimed no assists in the Premier League in 846 minutes combined, but we must all at least concede that they are an improvement on whomever was operating in those inverted positions last season.",
      "That’s not the case with Sesko, though. He’s got one goal, and needed three bites at that before he scored against Brentford, and is doing excellent work to realise the Manchester United fear that they have replaced one inexperienced striker who crumbled under the pressure with another.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund starring for Napoli having escaped Old Trafford is one of a full 20 reasons United should sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "“He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said when asked about Rodri’s absence against Burnley, before claiming he was taken off after an hour against Monaco for tactical reasons. ACL injuries are famously difficult to return from and easing him back into action is the way to go.",
      "But Nico Gonzalez replacing him on Wednesday before allowing Eric Dier a good sniff of his shin pad to concede a penalty in the dying moments, while simply a poor decision, will only add to the feeling that the £50m(?!) signing from Porto is not the Spain international’s long-term successor.",
      "Rodri should be in his prime at 29, but City’s metronome has lacked rhythm this season, and the apparent search for another No.6, just eight months after Gonzalez was recruited, which has seen Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson linked with a move to the Etihad, in itself raises huge questions as to whether Guardiola and the City bosses ever expect Rodri to return to his Ballon d’Or best.",
      "",
      "While we’re reticent to judge books by covers and refuse to sign up to the view that All Footballers Are Idiots, we can’t help but feel – entirely unfairly – after a start to his Liverpool career in which Kerkez doesn’t really look like he knows what he’s doing, that the 21-year-old may not be the fastest of learners.",
      "He’s the only Liverpool player to appear in all nine of their games this season, starting seven of them, and having got two goals and six assists in the Premier League for Bournemouth last season, he’s not got a sausage for the Reds, while ducking out of headers and providing nothing like the left-side solidity in defence next to Virgil van Dijk that Liverpool reaped the rewards in eight seasons of Andy Robertson.",
      "",
      "We loved watching Rogers last season, the goals and assists, but mainly because he’s not your typical No.10. He’s not renowned for delicate touches, a small turning circle or for having his head on a swivel in those tight spaces between midfield and defence.",
      "Of course, he can get on the half-turn and play defence-splitting passes, often as well as his namby-pamby counterparts in that position. But he also bullies his way through challenges, with his most memorable moments those in which he picks the ball up with no space in front of him and thinks ‘f*** it I’m just gonna run at the goal anyway’.",
      "But he always looked like a player – and he reminds of us Dele Alli in this way – that would really suffer when things aren’t quite right. The first touch is now worse than imperfect and therefore often unrecoverable, and while we’re not sure how Martin Keown expects Ezri Konsa to “lead” Rogers to improve his retention of possession, we don’t blame him for seeking answers to Rogers’ dramatic drop-off this season.",
      "He’s perhaps the strangest of the strange picks in Thomas Tuchel’s latest England squad.",
      "",
      "We all extolled the virtues of 20-goal Chris Wood, 11-assist Anthony Elanga, the creative excellence of Morgan Gibbs-White, the rise of Elliot Anderson and the eye-catching displays of fellow centre-back Murillo last term. But in our eyes – and we suspect in Nuno Espirito Santo’s – 2024/2025 was the season of Milenkovic.",
      "And we can’t imagine a defender who quite clearly bloody loves defending has ever had a more enjoyable time than while playing under a manager who values that art at least as much as he does. We therefore wonder whether he’s had a less enjoyable time than he’s enduring right now under a manager who sees defending as the scourge of football and now faces the sack just three weeks into his reign with no wins and four defeats in six games.",
      "Having been the lynchpin of a brilliantly solid Forest side for most of last season, Milenkovic now looks like the centre-back also-ran his £11m price tag always threatened he would be.",
      "In search of The Problem with league-leaders Liverpool, short of calling out scapegoat-in-chief Konate, most fingers of blame are currently pointing in Wirtz’s direction.",
      "While fellow nine-figure summer signing Alexander Isak has so far avoided rebuke having not had the benefit of pre-season and starting just three games, much like Mikel Arteta manages Netflix FC, as we’re always waiting for the next Arsenal season for them to win anything, we’re at risk of giving up on a Wirtz series which promises plenty but is yet to feature an episode in which anything really happens.",
      "",
      "“What he has given us in recent seasons is nothing short of brilliant,” John McGinn said after Watkins broke his duck and Villa’s in their 3-1 win over Fulham last weekend, hoping the goal will “shut a few people up”.",
      "“When he gets the ball you expect that he will score,” McGinn added. But we put it to the Villa captain that that’s rarely been what people have thought when Watkins gets the ball, and definitely not now.",
      "He has the air of a man who’s been linked with a big move for two seasons and is coming to terms with the fact that that will now never happen for him. We’re apparently not among the few people to have shut up.",
      "",
      "It wasn’t all that long ago that Pep Guardiola had such centre-back riches that he had to play a couple of them at full-back, maybe one in midfield and leave at least one very fine one on the bench. It was sort of a toss-up then as to who would play in those central positions, but at that point because they were all excellent. Now it feels more as though they’re much of a mediocre muchness.",
      "Dias has always been held up as the best – of a very good bunch and now a not-so-good bunch. Having rivalled Virgil van Dijk for at least a couple of seasons at the Premier League pinnacle, we’re now not convinced he would make a top ten.",
      "",
      "Nine games into last season, Salah had six goals and five assists compared to three goals and three assists this term, but the eye test grants a far greater indication of his struggles. He looks nowhere near as vital, and we mean that both in terms of his energy and his importance to the team.",
      "Slot claims the way in which opposition sides are now looking to play against Liverpool is having an effect on Salah, whom he does admit is “out of form”, but he must be wondering – as we all are – just how big an impact the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the arrival of Florian Wirtz, and him favouring the other side of Liverpool’s attack, is having on the Egyptian.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",

It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

      "“Most of the players want to turn things around; they believe that they can within this system, but there are exceptions within that dressing room, and that was the case also over the summer too.”",
      "Jacobs insists that is actually some of Amorim’s new summer signings who are the “most disillusioned” at Old Trafford so far this season.",
      "The journalist added: “I think, ironically, I’m told, but some of the new players in particular are the most disillusioned because the pitch that they were given tactically, in football terms, hasn’t yet matched up to the reality, so that’s quite intriguing.",
      "“As I’ve said many times, some of the new signings looked at the Manchester United squad, including some of the players that had gone, and thought one or two of those that have departed might also be quite conducive to their game.",
      "“Then you have Bruno Fernandes, who I wouldn’t call unhappy with his manager; if anything, they have got a positive relationship. He’s captain of the football club, but he’s unhappy with playing in that deeper role.”",
      "There have been claims that Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to give Amorim the full season but Jacobs reckons he may be given 38 Premier League matches from when he first joined.",
      "Jacobs continued: “Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around.",
      "“I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season.",
      "“I think more likely, from speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with taking over from Amorim, if Man Utd decide to sack him, but ex-Red Devils goalkeeper Ben Foster is unsure why the former England boss would want the role.",
      "Foster said on talkSPORT: “He’s got to be enjoying his life. Surely, for England, I don’t know why he would want to jump back into that frying pan, to be perfectly honest. Yeah, the answer for United, though, I honestly don’t know. I really don’t know.",

      "John Cross writes that Bellingham ‘has been sensationally left out’ of the squad and Thomas Tuchel ‘has effectively admitted’ he was ‘DROPPED’.",
      "Well he wasn’t part of the last England squad due to injury, only made his return for Real Madrid after more than two months out following surgery on September 20, and has played precisely 100 minutes of football in his four appearances since.",
      "As Tuchel pointed out in a press conference, while Bellingham “wanted to be called up” he ultimately “lacked rhythm”.",
      "But does it really need to be explained why a player who has started one game for club and country in the last 86 days not being picked to potentially face Wales in a friendly or Latvia in a World Cup qualifier isn’t a particularly ‘massive surprise’?",
      "The ‘effective admittance’ from Tuchel was his quote asking the proverbial question: “Why not bring the same group in because they set the standards?” And, of course, not mentioning Bellingham or indeed any player specifically by name in his helpful clarification as to why Bellingham has been ‘DROPPED’.",
      "‘It also comes just two days after Bellingham was named as the England fans’ Player of the Year so this must be seen as a major shock,’ Cross adds, as if an award for performances last season bears any relevance whatsoever to a decision made based entirely on circumstances in October 2025.",
      "Bellingham not being picked is notable and interesting. But it is also completely explicable and understandable if given more than a moment’s thought.",
      "",
      "Bellingham had been both ‘AXED’ and ‘DROPPED’ according to the MailOnline, who say ‘Tuchel’s cryptic comments hint it’s INTENTIONAL’, as if he might have accidentally left him off the list initially.",
      "Tuchel also ‘REFUSED Jude Bellingham’s request,’ which is one way of interpreting a elite-level professional footballer predictably wanting to play football all the time and a manager making decisions based on more things than that one-eyed desire.",

      "And Craig Hope picks up where he left off with a lengthy opinion piece again calling out Bellingham’s ‘leading man syndrome’, ‘intimidatory manner’ and ‘ego’.",
      "‘Tuchel clearly feels a change of mindset is needed if they are to prosper together,’ he writes. Either that or Bellingham’s four appearances since returning from a quite significant surgery in the summer have totalled one minute, 19 minutes, 70 minutes and ten minutes respectively, and England have more than enough good players to not feel the need to take unnecessary risks over fitness and, as Tuchel said, “rhythm”.",
      "",
      "This line from Hope brings up a point worth reiterating far and wide considering some of the coverage Mediawatch has seen of the England squad announcement:",
      "‘[Tuchel] needs to know if [Bellingham] has listened. He needs to know the reaction after he branded the 22-year-old’s on-field demeanour ‘repulsive’ in June.’",
      "A couple of points.",
      "Tuchel didn’t ‘brand’ Bellingham’s ‘on-field demeanour ‘repulsive”. He said sometimes people on the outside “cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile. If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV.”",
      "And more importantly, Tuchel also apologised unreservedly for using that word “unintentionally”, adding: “I am experienced enough and should’ve known better, I should’ve done better. I thought I had a little more credit with you guys (the media) that I do all this in my second language.”",
      "Obviously not. We would apologise but it seems like they are completely ignored by the following month.",

      "And of course Henry Winter reckons Bellingham being left out is ‘baffling’. To be fair, everything must be confusing when you view life through the prism of the first half of Peter Beardsley’s debut season for Liverpool, 1987/88.",

      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",

      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and tips more misery for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Burnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.",
      "The Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.",
      "The former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.",
      "Crystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.",
      "But they won't.",
      "As to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.",
      "A first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.",
      "Clubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.",
      "In a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.",
      "When Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.",
      "He's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.",
      "Yes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.",
      "Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.",
      "Wolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.",
      "The market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "There are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.",
      "The standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.",
      "Kayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.",
      "Douk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",
